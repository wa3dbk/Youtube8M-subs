00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.109 
lot of these on the land yeah so the
first<00:00:19.230> thing<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.680> our<00:00:20.250> beautiful<00:00:20.699> coconut

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
first thing is our beautiful coconut

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.679 
first thing is our beautiful coconut
palm<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.619> transplanted<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.939> 30

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
palm and we have transplanted to a 30

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.560 
palm and we have transplanted to a 30
liter<00:00:25.080> pot<00:00:25.380> from<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> morning<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
liter pot from this morning and at the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330 
liter pot from this morning and at the
moment<00:00:27.900> he's<00:00:28.019> doing<00:00:28.349> really<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.680> well<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
moment he's doing really really well I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.250 
moment he's doing really really well I
think<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.880> has<00:00:30.119> grown<00:00:30.420> through<00:00:30.810> 40

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
think it has grown through 40

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.010 
think it has grown through 40
centimetres<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.550> length<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.270> lower

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
centimetres so the length of my lower

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.700 
centimetres so the length of my lower
arm<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.989> remember<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:39.500> while<00:00:40.500> we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
arm you can see remember and while we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459 
arm you can see remember and while we
were<00:00:41.510> transplanting<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.230> smaller

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
were transplanting this from a smaller

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
were transplanting this from a smaller
pot<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> big<00:00:44.129> pot<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.120> thing<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.570> happened

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
pot to a big pot the thing that happened

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.529 
pot to a big pot the thing that happened
was<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.350> actual<00:00:46.860> coconut<00:00:47.370> seed<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.120> fell<00:00:48.329> off

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
was the actual coconut seed it fell off

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
was the actual coconut seed it fell off
and<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.530> an<00:00:49.620> accident<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.520> thought<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and it was an accident we thought it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.459 
and it was an accident we thought it
would<00:00:50.910> die<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.420> he<00:00:51.570> didn't<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> he's<00:00:52.289> still

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
would die but he didn't and he's still

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
would die but he didn't and he's still
growing<00:00:52.680> beautiful<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> green<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.420> healthy

think at the moment we have around 15 to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.540 
think at the moment we have around 15 to
20<00:02:12.520> dates<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:14.260> are<00:02:14.470> on<00:02:14.740> germinating

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
20 dates that that are on germinating

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.910 
20 dates that that are on germinating
and<00:02:15.640> growing<00:02:15.760> leads<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.410> hope<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.620> grow<00:02:17.890> a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and growing leads so we hope to grow a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.699 
and growing leads so we hope to grow a
lot<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.250> these<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.680> looked<00:02:20.680> at<00:02:20.830> how<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.070> grow

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
lot of these but I looked at how to grow

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.290 
lot of these but I looked at how to grow
date-palm<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.130> how<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.060> it's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
date-palm and how you have is that it's

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540 
date-palm and how you have is that it's
pretty<00:02:25.570> difficult<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.800> I'm<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.220> keen

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
pretty difficult so I'm not really keen

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400 
pretty difficult so I'm not really keen
on<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:28.000> aspect<00:02:28.209> but<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.780> don't<00:02:28.989> mind<00:02:29.170> growing

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
on that aspect but I don't mind growing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
on that aspect but I don't mind growing
it<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.440> other<00:02:32.560> thing<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.280> update

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
it so the other thing I like to update

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.530 
it so the other thing I like to update
is<00:02:33.970> our<00:02:34.680> project<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:36.100> how<00:02:36.370> experiment<00:02:37.209> with

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
is our project know how experiment with

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.650 
is our project know how experiment with
the<00:02:37.750> Jeff<00:02:38.230> fruit<00:02:38.500> seed<00:02:38.830> I'm<00:02:39.670> sorry<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.120> didn't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the Jeff fruit seed I'm sorry I didn't

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.490 
the Jeff fruit seed I'm sorry I didn't
do<00:02:41.020> many<00:02:41.350> updates<00:02:41.590> or<00:02:42.190> hardly<00:02:42.670> any<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:43.060> all<00:02:43.500> but

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
do many updates or hardly any at all but

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.490 
do many updates or hardly any at all but
a<00:02:44.530> moment<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.700> happily<00:02:46.030> say<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:47.140> out<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
a moment I can happily say that out of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.630 
a moment I can happily say that out of
all<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.040> three<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:49.300> experiment<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.410> did

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
all the three to experiment that we did

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.240 
all the three to experiment that we did
they<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:51.820> work<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:53.320> be<00:02:53.350> really<00:02:53.800> honest

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
they all work and to be really honest

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.410 
they all work and to be really honest
you<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.330> just<00:02:55.600> throw<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:55.989> into<00:02:56.910> any<00:02:57.910> soil

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
you can just throw it into any soil

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.199 
you can just throw it into any soil
medium<00:02:58.870> give<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.709> some<00:02:59.980> water<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:01.030> will

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
medium give it some water and it will

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.420 
medium give it some water and it will
germinate<00:03:01.510> because<00:03:02.250> jackfruit<00:03:03.250> seeds

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
germinate because jackfruit seeds

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.190 
germinate because jackfruit seeds
they're<00:03:03.760> really<00:03:04.060> easy<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.070> can<00:03:06.220> see

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
they're really easy and as you can see

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.000 
they're really easy and as you can see
these<00:03:08.340> are<00:03:09.340> some<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.670> them<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.510> I've<00:03:10.830> put<00:03:11.830> in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
these are some of them that I've put in

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.400 
these are some of them that I've put in
a<00:03:12.130> four<00:03:12.340> liter<00:03:12.549> bag<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.180> left<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.080> out<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.230> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
a four liter bag I left it out in the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.670 
a four liter bag I left it out in the
Sun<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.930> conditioner<00:03:17.650> a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
Sun just to get it just a conditioner a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.250 
Sun just to get it just a conditioner a
little<00:03:17.980> bit<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.900> unfortunately<00:03:19.900> it's<00:03:20.110> not

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
little bit but unfortunately it's not

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.870 
little bit but unfortunately it's not
doing<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:20.830> well<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:22.030> think<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:23.340> put<00:03:24.340> half<00:03:24.519> of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
doing so well and I think I put half of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.840 
doing so well and I think I put half of
the<00:03:25.330> seed<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.080> had<00:03:26.410> germinated<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.549> more

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the seed that I had germinated in a more

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.449 
the seed that I had germinated in a more
shady<00:03:28.180> area<00:03:28.930> hopefully<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.950> will<00:03:30.040> picked<00:03:30.280> up

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
shady area hopefully that will picked up

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.840 
shady area hopefully that will picked up
and<00:03:30.820> become<00:03:31.299> more<00:03:31.450> greener<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.519> one

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and become more greener but this one

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.630 
and become more greener but this one
right<00:03:36.850> here<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.750> can<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.980> was<00:03:39.340> once

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
right here you can see this was once

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.370 
right here you can see this was once
very<00:03:40.180> very<00:03:40.750> green<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.640> now<00:03:42.640> is<00:03:42.910> kind<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.780> lying

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
very very green and now is kind of lying

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.720 
very very green and now is kind of lying
yellow<00:03:45.600> kind<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.660> like<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> yellowy<00:03:47.260> color<00:03:47.860> it's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
yellow kind of like a yellowy color it's

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.660 
yellow kind of like a yellowy color it's
not<00:03:48.760> doing<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.120> well<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.600> might<00:03:49.810> be<00:03:50.310> because<00:03:51.310> of

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
not doing so well it might be because of

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.930 
not doing so well it might be because of
some<00:03:51.910> sort<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.150> fungal<00:03:52.540> infection<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.940> yeah

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
some sort of fungal infection but yeah

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.810 
some sort of fungal infection but yeah
I'm<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.209> gonna<00:03:55.329> spray<00:03:55.660> anything<00:03:56.760> I'm<00:03:57.760> just

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
I'm not gonna spray anything I'm just

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.850 
I'm not gonna spray anything I'm just
gonna<00:03:58.120> let<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.540> fight<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.110> disease<00:03:59.320> and

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
gonna let it fight the disease and

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.440 
gonna let it fight the disease and
now<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.099> have<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> second<00:04:02.730> cloth<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.270> cover

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
now that I have a second cloth to cover

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.350 
now that I have a second cloth to cover
and<00:04:04.020> less<00:04:04.500> Sun<00:04:04.860> sunlight<00:04:05.520> penetrating<00:04:06.209> it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
and less Sun sunlight penetrating it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.140 
and less Sun sunlight penetrating it
hopefully<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.900> will<00:04:07.050> grow<00:04:07.260> green<00:04:07.530> again<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
hopefully it will grow green again and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.110 
hopefully it will grow green again and
by<00:04:09.150> next<00:04:09.480> year<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.810> will<00:04:09.870> be<00:04:09.930> bigger<00:04:10.580> so<00:04:11.580> this

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
by next year it will be bigger so this

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.170 
by next year it will be bigger so this
section<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:13.130> garden<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.400> nearly<00:04:14.849> full

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
section of the garden is nearly full

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.080 
section of the garden is nearly full
shade<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:15.989> I've<00:04:16.560> put<00:04:16.799> some<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.459> jackfruit

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
shade and I've put some of the jackfruit

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.349 
shade and I've put some of the jackfruit
seeds<00:04:18.359> here<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.230> plant<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.730> can<00:04:21.030> see<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
seeds here on a plant and I can see the

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.060 
seeds here on a plant and I can see the
result<00:04:21.750> already<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.880> they're<00:04:23.880> newer<00:04:24.600> leaves

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
result already that they're newer leaves

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.750 
result already that they're newer leaves
they're<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.100> lot<00:04:26.250> more<00:04:26.430> greener<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.210> it's

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
they're a lot more greener and it's

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.700 
they're a lot more greener and it's
improving<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:30.120> lot<00:04:30.330> more<00:04:30.570> than<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.200> ones<00:04:31.410> that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
improving a lot more than the ones that

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.700 
improving a lot more than the ones that
I<00:04:31.740> left<00:04:32.100> our<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.610> 70%<00:04:33.060> shade<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.530> one

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
I left our in the 70% shade and the one

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.590 
I left our in the 70% shade and the one
of<00:04:34.830> our<00:04:34.950> favorite<00:04:35.520> spot<00:04:35.820> in<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.090> garden<00:04:36.450> is

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
of our favorite spot in the garden is

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.420 
of our favorite spot in the garden is
the<00:04:36.780> custard<00:04:37.080> apple<00:04:37.350> tree<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.800> as<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.310> can

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
the custard apple tree and as you can

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.690 
the custard apple tree and as you can
see<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:39.410> after<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.770> pollination<00:04:41.310> and

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
see it's after the pollination and

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.969 
see it's after the pollination and
there's<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.419> lot<00:04:42.570> more<00:04:42.750> foliage<00:04:43.229> and<00:04:43.530> leaves

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
there's a lot more foliage and leaves

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.120 
there's a lot more foliage and leaves
are<00:04:44.220> coming<00:04:44.370> out<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:45.510> trees<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.530> mean<00:04:46.860> the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
are coming out the trees I mean the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.820 
are coming out the trees I mean the
branches<00:04:47.550> are<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.729> lot<00:04:47.940> more<00:04:47.970> heavy<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.830> this

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
branches are a lot more heavy and this

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.820 
branches are a lot more heavy and this
is<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.130> reason<00:04:50.490> why<00:04:50.669> we<00:04:51.270> said<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.720> we<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.740> a

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
is the reason why we said that we in a

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.670 
is the reason why we said that we in a
previous<00:04:53.310> video<00:04:53.550> video<00:04:54.330> we<00:04:54.900> have<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.169> string

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
previous video video we have to string

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.120 
previous video video we have to string
them<00:04:55.830> up<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.370> support<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.060> branch<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.650> here

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
them up and support the branch so here

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.780 
them up and support the branch so here
we<00:04:59.220> got<00:04:59.340> one<00:04:59.580> branch<00:05:00.450> with<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.290> string<00:05:01.790> tying

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
we got one branch with the string tying

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.719 
we got one branch with the string tying
on<00:05:03.000> top<00:05:03.240> it's<00:05:04.050> really<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.590> sagging<00:05:05.340> all<00:05:05.610> the
