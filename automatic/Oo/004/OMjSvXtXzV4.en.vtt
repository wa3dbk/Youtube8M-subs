00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
because I think at last Nations Cup we

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.280 
because I think at last Nations Cup we
did<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:40.800> qualify<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.760> were<00:02:41.880> devastated<00:02:42.290> most

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
did not qualify we were devastated most

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.479
