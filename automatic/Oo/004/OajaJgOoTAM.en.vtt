00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.410
 Welcome to another episode of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.910
 getting better in the rack and wanting today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 Let's look at some possibilities 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.660
 how to play a game as possible 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 dramatic and effective way 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.809
 can give away though it actually 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.900
 already as good as won 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.810
 Let's get started number one of the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.760
 disconnect the disco nights or the fg 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.039
 Of course, being one is very, very long 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.980
 tradition in league of legends and is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 enormously effective in every phase of play 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 the whole, however, a certain dramatic 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 and to give a little spice 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 you should only disconnect if 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.840
 You realize that you are in the lead 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 since or that of playing the Carried 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.780
 to the anger of others even further and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.340
 to drive the height 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 should you then back into the game 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 come back if actually everything 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.129
 lost is that brings by not only 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.710
 many reports but also the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.710
 possibility of making others talk 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.040
 to catch variant number two on god 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.780
 to let 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.090
 also this one very classic 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.560
 Variant about a game already won 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.600
 but still to lose 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.790
 so as not to get too many reports 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.870
 The whole thing tries a little more subtle 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.020
 to tackle 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.690
 so try as eg carey right in 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.970
 the middle in support while at the uno in 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.010
 The nearness is you have a bandit 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.900
 shot guaranteed and the whole team 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:40.420
 try to help you and die 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:42.700
 the customer possibility number three order 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.690
 Losing games is our arrogance 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.100
 best friend 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.470
 the advantage here is that you 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.810
 gets comparatively little reports 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.240
 goal is definitely his own 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.000
 strongly reject dominate and then decline 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.420
 and kills after the opposing team 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.040
 give 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.570
 You have to be very careful 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.880
 be that the team is not startled 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.850
 this method is excellent 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.069
 with the variant of the often be caught 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.259
 combine to crown the whole thing 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.950
 you do not forget your own team too 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.840
 flee 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.410
 but the opponent should not be too 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.410
 come shortly 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.890
 Number four of the fanpage teams are 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.870
 first a matter for yourself 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
 It is important to be pressing 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.709
 Pay attention and know when to get in one 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.660
 Team fight should come and when 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.090
 not the best variant is how 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.349
 then attack the opponent if he 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.810
 has the ball 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.610
 The focus should definitely be on the table 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.489
 lie and tried the opponents 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.860
 board on your own idea carey rush 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.810
 to make it especially important too 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.090
 one or the other drives can 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.400
 help the whole very very subtle 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.930
 tried to get started even if the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.610
 opponents over many areas sayings 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.590
 has to lump 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.739
 this makes the whole thing even more dramatic 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.739
 becomes 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.940
 and last but not least, number five 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.670
 passive gameplay combined with the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.860
 point udev so if you realize that you 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.930
 just in the lead since you have 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.150
 more farm merkels then tried 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.820
 by no means the opponent in a team too 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.770
 lure puts the focus on that here 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.300
 of course, try to be a guardian 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.550
 also gives the opponent the possibility 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.040
 again gold and experience to win over 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.320
 to get back to the game of sand 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.360
 one or the other help is the opponent 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.160
 Of course, also highly recommended 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.770
 you should go this way already 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.570
 it has reached an equal 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.209
 now important that the opponent also his 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.160
 Trying to play can therefore be tried 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.230
 if the opponent has a lot of reach 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.320
 enormous damages only from a great distance 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.340
 to do this in the same way 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.900
 Engage here would be the biggest mistake 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.580
 So wait until you are half dead time 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.770
 and then either the opponent lets that 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.970
 do a job or try one yourself 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.400
 initiate fight 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.470
 Well that was just a few options like 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.330
 a game won easily 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.890
 can give me write in the 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:29.600
 comments on how to do it 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:31.310
 can you have this video was 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.410
 Of course not meant seriously 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.750
 and should represent a form of mine 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.820
 Frustration for a grief in the game 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.020
 bit in a humorous way and 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.400
 wise dismantle 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.110
 I am aware that all humans 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.030
 are and we are quite easy to fail 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.470
 own and therefore one or the other 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.910
 lose the game because of it 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.800
 also it is with me so I then 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.960
 I feel quite a bit ergo 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.280
 just to receive a lot but this excitement 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.710
 You definitely should not 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.570
 dominate your own game more 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.630
 league of legends because we enjoy it 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.020
 So stay relaxed and have fun while 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.020
 rank
