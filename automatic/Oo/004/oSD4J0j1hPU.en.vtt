installations<00:00:08.760> can<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.980> before<00:00:10.980> we<00:00:11.160> remove

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
installations can be before we remove

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.940 
installations can be before we remove
the<00:00:11.790> bridge<00:00:12.059> we<00:00:12.570> need<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> reference<00:00:13.110> point<00:00:13.590> as

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the bridge we need a reference point as

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.880 
the bridge we need a reference point as
to<00:00:14.490> where<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.880> adjust<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.960> saddle<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> new

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
to where to adjust the saddle on the new

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310 
to where to adjust the saddle on the new
bridge<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:18.779> gonna<00:00:18.869> put<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
bridge so we're gonna put the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.340 
bridge so we're gonna put the
straightedge<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.580> up<00:00:20.699> against<00:00:20.970> some<00:00:21.119> nut

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350

string<00:00:29.300> is<00:00:30.300> contacting<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.140> saddle<00:00:32.930> which<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
string is contacting the saddle which is

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.819 
string is contacting the saddle which is
right<00:00:34.350> there

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
right there

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.670 
right there
the<00:00:35.820> next<00:00:36.120> reference<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.840> need<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.380> on

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the next reference we need to have on

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880 
the next reference we need to have on
the<00:00:37.800> g<00:00:38.040> string<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.120> height<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the g string is the height so you can

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.549 
the g string is the height so you can
either<00:00:41.430> use<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> piece<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> tape<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> ruler<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
either use a piece of tape or a ruler to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
either use a piece of tape or a ruler to
get<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.390> measurement<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> let's<00:00:47.489> pull<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
get that measurement so let's pull the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
get that measurement so let's pull the
strings<00:00:48.120> off<00:00:48.440> now<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> strings<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.129> off

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
strings off now the strings are off

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:03.170 
strings off now the strings are off
let's<00:00:50.640> take<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> bridge<00:00:51.210> off<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.940> lift

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
let's take the bridge off and as we lift

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
let's take the bridge off and as we lift
this<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.049> old<00:01:04.199> bridge<00:01:04.530> you'll<00:01:05.040> notice

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
this up the old bridge you'll notice

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010

now let's put the screws in the holes we

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.030 
now let's put the screws in the holes we
just<00:03:22.890> drilled<00:03:27.170> when<00:03:28.170> you're<00:03:28.320> done<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.980> is

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
just drilled when you're done this is

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.340 
just drilled when you're done this is
the<00:03:29.190> way<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.550> should<00:03:29.610> look<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.300> these<00:03:31.170> are

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
the way it should look and these are

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.860 
the way it should look and these are
string<00:03:31.740> through<00:03:32.100> holes<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.270> are<00:03:33.420> left<00:03:33.480> open
