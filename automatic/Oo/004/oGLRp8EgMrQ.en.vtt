00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 for me this sentence of the week for 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 Christian Unity reminds me that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 beautiful path traveled with saintÃ© j du 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.060
 path of justice friendship way 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.189
 fraternity that leads a lot more 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.960
 far beyond what one might believe in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 start is the experience of the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.059
 community in fact we walk with the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 lord and we do not know how far we know 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.010
 not where he leads us but we see 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.270
 how much it tells us it away when I 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.890
 arrived in charenton with others 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.589
 members of the community 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's in 2010 well we have 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.519
 met a lot of homeless people whose 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 some find shelter in the wood of 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.370
 vincennes 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 others in some small corners of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.019
 the city and we started the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.319
 meet to know them each by 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.329
 his has forged links with them is 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:06.300
 today well over two years after 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.490
 true friendships not his 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.260
 new together the christmas meal on the 25th 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.220
 December 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.140
 let's also celebrate the birthday of one 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.360
 from each other and every week we 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.190
 have this moment of meeting you have it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.530
 found in the street in the wood is 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.950
 really 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.710
 the sad 1 that teaches us to live 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.500
 that ask me to live this and I 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.090
 believe that for holy egidio there was a 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 moment especially we took 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.430
 awareness of this common witness 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.850
 Christians in the great jubilee of 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.750
 the year 2000 when Pope John Paul II 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.720
 wished to make the memory of all 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.649
 those who gave their lives for the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.360
 time in the name of Christ is there was 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.280
 a big survey in every 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.780
 dioceses of the world and demons in the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.979
 community had engaged much in 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.979
 this historic work 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.240
 following this investigation also 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.570
 well we wished 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.549
 to commemorate the memories 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.409
 of all and all who gave their 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.550
 life and during the holy week at 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.319
 beginning of the holy week in 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.620
 different cities in Paris this is the case 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.660
 a prayer is organized in memory of 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.900
 witnesses of faith and it is a prayer 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.360
 ecumenical where we invite of course 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.180
 so a pastor also a representative 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.900
 of an Orthodox church and together we 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.900
 remember all those Christians who 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.760
 have made the game witness limited in 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.290
 just wanting to work for the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 justice for others
