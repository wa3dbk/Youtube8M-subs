hello today we're going to be making the
dollar<00:00:02.520> bill<00:00:02.850> house<00:00:03.419> flop<00:00:03.780> or<00:00:04.410> some<00:00:05.069> people

dollar bill house flop or some people
caught<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.759> cicada<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.629> we're<00:00:07.350> gonna<00:00:07.500> fold<00:00:07.710> out

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
caught a cicada and we're gonna fold out

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.950 
caught a cicada and we're gonna fold out
the<00:00:08.400> first<00:00:08.639> step<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.300> by<00:00:09.480> falling<00:00:09.540> into<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the first step just by falling into a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.690 
the first step just by falling into a
dollar<00:00:10.139> bill<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.380> half<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.370> then<00:00:11.490> we're<00:00:11.610> gonna

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
dollar bill in half and then we're gonna

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.669 
dollar bill in half and then we're gonna
unfold<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.840> point<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.230> step<00:00:13.469> is

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
unfold it the point of this step is

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.049 
unfold it the point of this step is
doing<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> good<00:00:14.099> sharp<00:00:14.370> crease<00:00:14.639> right<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
doing a good sharp crease right in the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.900 
doing a good sharp crease right in the
middle<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.450> we'll<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.590> guiding<00:00:16.949> line<00:00:17.100> for

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
middle so we'll have a guiding line for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.880 
middle so we'll have a guiding line for
use<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.240> later<00:00:18.359> folds<00:00:18.840> you'll<00:00:19.500> notice<00:00:19.770> my

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
use in later folds you'll notice my

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.769 
use in later folds you'll notice my
dollar<00:00:20.130> bill<00:00:20.340> does<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.090> few<00:00:21.300> folds<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.720> it

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
dollar bill does have a few folds in it

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.359 
dollar bill does have a few folds in it
already<00:00:22.080> that's<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.859> video<00:00:23.130> goes<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
already that's just so this video goes a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.779 
already that's just so this video goes a
little<00:00:23.670> bit<00:00:23.760> more<00:00:23.910> smoothly<00:00:25.220> but<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.490> do

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
little bit more smoothly but if you do

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.040 
little bit more smoothly but if you do
this<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.090> home<00:00:27.119> you're<00:00:27.480> gonna<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> start

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this at home you're gonna want to start

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
this at home you're gonna want to start
off<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.470> crisp<00:00:28.769> dollar<00:00:29.010> bill<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> end

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
off with a crisp dollar bill so the end

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.479 
off with a crisp dollar bill so the end
results<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.720> better<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> next<00:00:32.250> step

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
results will be better so the next step

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
results will be better so the next step
I<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.640> did<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.540> folding<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> dollar

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I just did it's folding in the dollar

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
I just did it's folding in the dollar
bill<00:00:34.530> down<00:00:34.950> take<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> corner<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.210> fold<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
bill down take the corner and fold it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
bill down take the corner and fold it
over<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.079> sides<00:00:37.380> meet<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
over to the sides meet kind of like a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
over to the sides meet kind of like a
paper<00:00:38.760> airplane<00:00:39.649> do<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> same<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
paper airplane do the same thing to the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.889 
paper airplane do the same thing to the
other<00:00:41.370> side<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.030> unlike<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> paper<00:00:42.719> airplane

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
other side but unlike a paper airplane

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840 
other side but unlike a paper airplane
they're<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.500> meet<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> middle<00:00:44.070> I'm

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
they're not gonna meet in the middle I'm

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.610 
they're not gonna meet in the middle I'm
just<00:00:45.030> gonna<00:00:45.180> fold<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.480> flat<00:00:45.539> along<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
just gonna fold them flat along the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.910 
just gonna fold them flat along the
bottom<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> next<00:00:49.020> step<00:00:49.200> after<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.770> have

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
bottom so the next step after we have

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.130 
bottom so the next step after we have
our<00:00:49.950> triangle<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> take<00:00:51.719> each<00:00:51.750> side

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
our triangle here is to take each side

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
our triangle here is to take each side
and<00:00:52.320> fold<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.649> back<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> middle<00:00:53.370> line<00:00:53.520> we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and fold it back to the middle line we

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
and fold it back to the middle line we
created<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> very<00:00:54.719> beginning<00:00:55.010> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
created it in the very beginning the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
created it in the very beginning the
best<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> line<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.420> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
best way to do that is to line up this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.959 
best way to do that is to line up this
edge<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:57.840> across<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.649> center<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.820> once

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
edge right across the center and once

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.220 
edge right across the center and once
you<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.270> where<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> wanna<00:01:00.660> hold<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> place

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you get it where you wanna hold in place

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.340 
you get it where you wanna hold in place
with<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.530> hand<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:03.480> flatten<00:01:04.199> out<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
with one hand and just flatten out that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.609 
with one hand and just flatten out that
others<00:01:04.680> had<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> make<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> good<00:01:05.369> sharp<00:01:05.640> crease

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
others had to make a good sharp crease

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.480 
others had to make a good sharp crease
same<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:08.600> get<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> where<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.490> then

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
same thing get it where you want it then

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
same thing get it where you want it then
put<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> crease<00:01:12.030> hand<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.840> hold<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.229> place

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
put the crease hand to hold it in place

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.969 
put the crease hand to hold it in place
now<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> fold<00:01:16.409> upwards<00:01:16.830> on

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
now it's gonna want to fold upwards on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
now it's gonna want to fold upwards on
you<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.670> fine<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.990> next

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
you that's just fine because the next

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.870 
you that's just fine because the next
thing<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> fold<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.369> down<00:01:20.640> we're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
thing is to fold these back down we're

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
thing is to fold these back down we're
gonna<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> wings<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:22.170> our<00:01:22.530> fly<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.979> our

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
gonna make the wings of our fly or our

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
gonna make the wings of our fly or our
puck<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:24.240> gonna<00:01:24.330> make<00:01:24.540> those<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
come out of the middle of the end both

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.120 
come out of the middle of the end both
downwards<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.329> outwards

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
one letter down here the e on this side

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
one letter down here the e on this side
and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> L<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.570> side<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> kind

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and the L on that side you want to kind

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.969 
and the L on that side you want to kind
of<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.820> symmetrical<00:01:42.979> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
of make sure that it's symmetrical and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
of make sure that it's symmetrical and
then<00:01:44.100> sharpen<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> creases<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
then sharpen up the creases now the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
then sharpen up the creases now the
hardest<00:01:46.950> step<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
hardest step in this in it's not that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
hardest step in this in it's not that
hard<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.110> need<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> unfold<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.860> at

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
hard is that we need to unfold this at

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
hard is that we need to unfold this at
the<00:01:50.220> top<00:01:50.399> only<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.420> put<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.720> finger<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the top only so put one finger at the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
the top only so put one finger at the
bottom<00:01:52.500> reach<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.210> pull<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
bottom reach in here I just pull this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.760 
bottom reach in here I just pull this
out<00:01:55.610> once<00:01:56.610> you've<00:01:56.729> done<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.619> I'm<00:01:58.619> gonna

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
out once you've done that I'm gonna

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.760 
out once you've done that I'm gonna
flatten<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.280> folds<00:01:59.759> sharpen<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.770> do

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
flatten out your folds sharpen it up do

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.830 
flatten out your folds sharpen it up do
the<00:02:01.890> same<00:02:02.100> thing<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> other<00:02:03.000> side

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.280 

hey<00:02:08.840> there<00:02:09.050> we<00:02:09.170> go<00:02:10.990> now

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
hey there we go now

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.160 
hey there we go now
next<00:02:13.160> step<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.550> need<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.820> make<00:02:14.020> towards<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
next step we need to make towards the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.600 
next step we need to make towards the
upper<00:02:15.380> body<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.800> bug<00:02:15.980> we're<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
upper body of the bug we're going to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.030 
upper body of the bug we're going to
take<00:02:17.210> these<00:02:17.330> corners<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:17.920> start<00:02:18.920> with<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
take these corners here start with the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.470 
take these corners here start with the
one<00:02:19.220> that's<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.490> top<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.360> kind<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.350> fold<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.740> as

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
one that's on top and kind of fold it as

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.250 
one that's on top and kind of fold it as
a<00:02:23.480> veal<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.990> away<00:02:24.830> from<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.220> center<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
a veal and away from the center for this

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.320 
a veal and away from the center for this
one<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.680> kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> match<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.460> with<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
one you can kind of match it up with the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.820 
one you can kind of match it up with the
dollar<00:02:29.480> bill<00:02:29.720> line<00:02:29.930> that's<00:02:30.200> under<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:30.740> you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
dollar bill line that's under it if you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.450 
dollar bill line that's under it if you
want<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:32.830> kind<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.920> like<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
want to kind of like that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.450 
want to kind of like that
and<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:35.750> crease<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:36.530> are<00:02:36.650> folding<00:02:36.860> under

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
and then crease we are folding under

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.880 
and then crease we are folding under
itself<00:02:37.760> they'll<00:02:38.720> be<00:02:38.810> easier<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> see<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.650> this

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
itself they'll be easier to see on this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
itself they'll be easier to see on this
next<00:02:40.220> one<00:02:40.340> we're<00:02:40.430> going<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.610> do<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> same

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
next one we're going to do the same

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.960 
next one we're going to do the same
thing<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:42.110> we're<00:02:42.230> folding<00:02:42.560> down<00:02:45.550> also<00:02:46.550> folding

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
thing so we're folding down also folding

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.250 
thing so we're folding down also folding
away<00:02:47.810> from<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:50.060> center<00:02:50.510> line<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.020> we're<00:02:51.140> gonna

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
away from the center line so we're gonna

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.530 
away from the center line so we're gonna
end<00:02:51.440> up<00:02:51.740> with<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.490> v-shape<00:02:52.970> just<00:02:53.210> like<00:02:53.330> that

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
end up with a v-shape just like that

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.630 
end up with a v-shape just like that
once<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.320> get<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.680> kinda<00:02:55.220> where<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.460> want

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
once you get that kinda where you want

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.150 
once you get that kinda where you want
it<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.880> pretty<00:02:56.450> similar<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.560> symmetrical

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
it like pretty similar and symmetrical

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.290 
it like pretty similar and symmetrical
you<00:03:00.490> can<00:03:01.490> go<00:03:01.640> ahead<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.640> increase<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:04.910> up

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
you can go ahead and increase that up

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.520 
you can go ahead and increase that up
now<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:05.810> you're<00:03:05.930> doing<00:03:06.020> this<00:03:06.200> at<00:03:06.350> home<00:03:06.380> I

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
now if you're doing this at home I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.500 
now if you're doing this at home I
recommend<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:07.100> take<00:03:07.250> some<00:03:07.430> time<00:03:07.640> make<00:03:08.480> sure

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
recommend you take some time make sure

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.420 
recommend you take some time make sure
that<00:03:08.660> those<00:03:08.960> are<00:03:09.020> really<00:03:09.320> even<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.250> just

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that those are really even but I just

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.550 
that those are really even but I just
need<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.670> go<00:03:10.760> on<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.060> next<00:03:11.270> step<00:03:11.480> here<00:03:11.560> and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
need to go on to the next step here and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.310 
need to go on to the next step here and
that's<00:03:13.520> actually<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.000> last<00:03:14.180> step<00:03:14.510> that's

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
that's actually the last step that's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.810 
that's actually the last step that's
gonna<00:03:15.530> be<00:03:15.680> where<00:03:15.920> we<00:03:16.010> need<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.190> divide<00:03:16.550> this

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
gonna be where we need to divide this

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.080 
gonna be where we need to divide this
kind<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.270> halfway<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:19.550> right<00:03:19.730> around<00:03:19.880> through

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
kind of halfway so right around through

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.600 
kind of halfway so right around through
here<00:03:20.120> or<00:03:20.390> maybe<00:03:20.510> across<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:22.010> edge<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.459> this

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
here or maybe across the edge of this

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.860 
here or maybe across the edge of this
circle<00:03:23.540> around<00:03:23.630> our<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:25.480> we're<00:03:26.480> gonna<00:03:26.570> fold

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
circle around our one we're gonna fold

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.350 
circle around our one we're gonna fold
that<00:03:27.220> under<00:03:28.220> once<00:03:28.820> again<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.090> think<00:03:32.239> my

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
that under once again so I think my

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.520 
that under once again so I think my
hands<00:03:32.540> are<00:03:32.660> kind<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.900> covering<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.230> up<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.500> that

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
hands are kind of covering it up on that

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.110 
hands are kind of covering it up on that
side<00:03:33.830> do<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.520> same<00:03:34.700> thing<00:03:34.880> on<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.060> side

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
side do the same thing on this side

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.310 
side do the same thing on this side
maybe<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:35.690> can<00:03:35.810> show<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.230> little

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
maybe you can show it to you a little

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.790 
maybe you can show it to you a little
better<00:03:36.560> kind<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.459> picking<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.180> halfway<00:03:38.390> point

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
better kind of picking the halfway point

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.260 
better kind of picking the halfway point
across<00:03:39.800> this<00:03:40.010> way<00:03:40.250> imagine<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.850> line<00:03:41.030> right

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
across this way imagine a line right

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.020 
across this way imagine a line right
through<00:03:41.300> here

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
through here

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.660 
through here
excuse<00:03:44.030> me<00:03:44.150> right<00:03:44.300> through<00:03:44.480> here<00:03:45.550> then<00:03:46.550> we're

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
excuse me right through here then we're

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.020 
excuse me right through here then we're
gonna<00:03:46.790> take<00:03:46.970> that<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.870> fold<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.020> under

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.190 

if<00:03:55.030> all<00:03:55.630> science<00:03:56.110> nice<00:03:56.319> sharp<00:03:56.620> creases<00:03:58.200> and

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
if all science nice sharp creases and

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.490 
if all science nice sharp creases and
there<00:04:00.069> you<00:04:00.160> have<00:04:00.220> kind<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.330> housefly<00:04:01.510> now

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
there you have kind of a housefly now

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.930 
there you have kind of a housefly now
this<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.709> more<00:04:02.860> like<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.069> big<00:04:03.220> fat<00:04:03.430> beetle<00:04:03.790> you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
this is more like a big fat beetle you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.420 
this is more like a big fat beetle you
want<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.330> skinnier<00:04:04.690> bug<00:04:04.989> do<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.890> same<00:04:06.130> thing

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
want a skinnier bug do the same thing

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.650 
want a skinnier bug do the same thing
but<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.360> can<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:08.230> fold<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.530> under<00:04:08.680> more<00:04:12.660> so

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
but you can just fold it under more so

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.920 
but you can just fold it under more so
you<00:04:13.720> can<00:04:13.810> take<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.080> other<00:04:14.230> side<00:04:18.750> fold<00:04:19.750> it

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
you can take the other side fold it

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.490 
you can take the other side fold it
under<00:04:20.109> more<00:04:21.210> you<00:04:22.210> get<00:04:22.389> more<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.930> winged

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
under more you get more of like a winged

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.640 
under more you get more of like a winged
insect<00:04:24.479> so<00:04:25.479> that's<00:04:25.810> all<00:04:25.930> there<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.139> to<00:04:26.350> it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
insect so that's all there is to it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.719 
insect so that's all there is to it
remember<00:04:27.190> make<00:04:27.460> good<00:04:27.669> sharp<00:04:28.090> creases<00:04:28.389> and

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
remember make good sharp creases and

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.730 
remember make good sharp creases and
spend<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:30.880> bit<00:04:31.030> time<00:04:31.389> each<00:04:32.020> step<00:04:32.290> to<00:04:32.620> end

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
spend a little bit time each step to end

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.020 
spend a little bit time each step to end
up<00:04:32.860> with<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.070> best<00:04:33.250> possible<00:04:33.580> result<00:04:33.880> at<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
up with the best possible result at the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.210 
up with the best possible result at the
end
