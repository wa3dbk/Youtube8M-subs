 empty jack guards for 70 years of life 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.500
 him a secret about the youth but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 Now he decides to tell this story. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.260
 For us, the story of how the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.260
 three months in which he spent in the circus 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 of the Benzini brothers, the biggest 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.030
 earth the story of this youth then 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.149
 begins as a Jacobin to do the tests 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.799
 right end of Cornell University in 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.170
 veterinary course 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.420
 only that while he is doing these 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 evidence it is called by the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.250
 a news item receives the level it now 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 it's time then without having money without 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.619
 diego decides to flee to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.330
 another city where he may be able to 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 find better conditions only one 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.860
 detail 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.590
 the book passes and 1930 states 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.079
 united in the time of the Great Depression 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 so this situation is very difficult 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.500
 economy then moving to another 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 city â€‹â€‹by train rails 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.900
 the right to run into a train that is the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.119
 the benzini brothers flying squadron 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.970
 greatest spectacle of the land as I said 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.040
 he said that then jumping on this train without 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.000
 know he was join a 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.890
 circus troupe is cool this 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.810
 view of the right as an employee of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 circus because the animal there are always people 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.060
 as is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 adi behind the makeup and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.620
 Circus artists , right? 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.040
 how are people suffering there for not 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:11.560
 earning money is sometimes not being paid 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.450
 and work hard to work hard and see the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 the animals suffering in the hand of the handlers 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.250
 and everything else 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.230
 and when he meets Marlena he starts to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.010
 roll a climate like that because he realizes 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.340
 as delicate as she is beautiful and he 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.550
 extremely in love and find 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.160
 our headline right book 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.330
 our most important part comes to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.930
 our rose 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.600
 the elephant and they live in that elephant 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.780
 a great opportunity to make a 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.310
 circus bomb only there that the strata their pain 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.170
 There is no mirror, you never go. 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.450
 can do nothing with this lack 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 because it 's a stupid animal in the face 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.180
 of the land and she does not know how to do anything 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.790
 when the attendant of the rose picks up and only 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.269
 as a destination of water in it and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.549
 The clinician realizes that she is not as 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.380
 ass like it is talking to 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.620
 language of environmental law over time 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.880
 club that his 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.670
 kamel and 15 were thrown off the train and 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.730
 then in this very revolted way and the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.130
 His friends tell him what they're going to do. 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.840
 a lot is against the circus that goes 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.360
 open all cages during the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.110
 spectacle that will make the biggest mockery and 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.510
 This really happens then Diego stays 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.579
 worried not all that blue animals 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.010
 running is worried about the galley 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:41.540
 When he arrives at the main tent he 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:45.560
 see Marlene and Rose and something to the guinea 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.890
 fighting with her happens murder 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.190
 and that's the question who killed 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.829
 I'll leave this question on the air but I 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.290
 I indicate the book is very good I've seen the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.049
 I really liked the movie . 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.970
 Christ the lighthouse where he is and if he 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.190
 It's amazing in this situation that he 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.360
 really about interpreting the album that 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.100
 very well 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.590
 I imagined but not a bit more 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.930
 delicate in a little softer than 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.680
 harris played but I really liked it 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.160
 also her and the final people 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.700

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.090
