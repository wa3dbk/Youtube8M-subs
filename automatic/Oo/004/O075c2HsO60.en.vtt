00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
exercises more efficient so instead of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.030 
exercises more efficient so instead of
having<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.159> do<00:01:19.280> more<00:01:19.460> reps<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:20.920> do<00:01:21.920> this

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
having to do more reps you do this

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.890 
having to do more reps you do this
little<00:01:22.189> trick<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.180> makes<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:23.689> more

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
little trick and it makes it more

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.940 
little trick and it makes it more
efficient<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.380> then<00:01:24.500> you're<00:01:24.680> building

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
efficient and then you're building

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.679 
efficient and then you're building
muscle<00:01:25.040> faster<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:25.729> easier<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.570> also

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
muscle faster and easier and it also

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.420 
muscle faster and easier and it also
tells<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.140> things<00:01:27.259> like<00:01:27.409> why<00:01:27.920> crunches<00:01:28.340> and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
situps are the absolute worst thing you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.929 
situps are the absolute worst thing you
can<00:01:30.350> do<00:01:30.530> if<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.770> want<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.130> have<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.280> ripped

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
six-pack of course so there's been

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.719 
six-pack of course so there's been
plenty<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.750> success<00:01:36.079> stories<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.610> can
