 then with the ring finger we pull the first 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.260

 and fourth final position 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.939
 index fingers squeeze two at once 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.810
 strings 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:09.930
 lower on the eighth fret and middle finger 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.629
 clamps the third string in the ninth year and 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.939
 losing the same thing losing two 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.519
 go to guitar fight 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.829
 then the whole song is played by the fight six 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.349
 without jamming at a fast pace who is not 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.900
 knows looks like we play first 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.239
 thumb pad from top to bottom in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.200
 accent sound then you can nail 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.680
 index finger is also a blow from above 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.919
 then goes downwards 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.730
 fingers do two movements from bottom to top and 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.659
 in custody 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.659
 make two moves 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.090
 lower string all after which the fight 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.180
 starts right from the beginning now repeat 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.180
 slow 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.730
 now speeding up 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.470
 and start the stove with the first movement of the battle 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:28.990
 come out again soon 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.410
 I specifically for you this 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.210
 priper means it turns out that we lose 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.820
 This fight once on each 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.670
 chord in the verses as in the choruses 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.310
 mean for beginners 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.670
 who else is difficult to clamp on the entry 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.080
 I recommend this position to play 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.200
 intro here on these same chords a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.650
 bust 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:01.530
 leave the same that is the movement from above 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.530
 down and 1 2 1 2 strings are obtained so
