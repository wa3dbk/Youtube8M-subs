about which hands to keep in which to

throw back especially in particular
matchups<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.570> takes<00:00:45.780> some<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.200> playing

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

each<00:00:47.219> match<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> understand<00:00:48.980> what<00:00:49.980> cards

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
each match up to understand what cards

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.119 
each match up to understand what cards
and<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.940> hands<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.379> which

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and what hands can get there and which

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.720 
and what hands can get there and which
need<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.640> tossed<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.949> here<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> block<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
need to be tossed back here I block and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.660 
need to be tossed back here I block and
I<00:00:56.910> decided<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.719> stack<00:00:58.109> damage<00:00:58.579> against<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I decided just stack damage against the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
I decided just stack damage against the
Intimidator<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.230> more

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
Intimidator because I have two more

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
Intimidator because I have two more
tribe<00:01:01.710> elders<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.219> hand<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
tribe elders in hand and I want them to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
tribe elders in hand and I want them to
be<00:01:03.329> able<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.600> block<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> save

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
be able to block and it's going to save

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.170 
be able to block and it's going to save
me<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> point<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> damage<00:01:06.570> every<00:01:07.530> turn<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.180> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
me a point of damage every turn and I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
me a point of damage every turn and I
decided<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:09.840> worth<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.439> this

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
decided that that's worth it with this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.700 
decided that that's worth it with this
hand<00:01:12.470> there's<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> third<00:01:14.100> goblins<00:01:15.000> letter

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
hand there's the third goblins letter

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.859 
hand there's the third goblins letter
and<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> block<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> 22<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
and so I block the 22 here because I

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
and so I block the 22 here because I
want<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.020> fetch<00:01:22.259> elana<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.920> does<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.490> me

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
want to go fetch elana it does take me

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.969 
want to go fetch elana it does take me
some<00:01:23.820> time<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.420> want<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> consider<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
some time I want to consider the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.399 
some time I want to consider the
potential<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.850> blocking<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.990> trading

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
potential of just blocking and trading

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.310 
potential of just blocking and trading
once<00:01:28.619> again<00:01:30.560> but<00:01:32.420> after<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> need<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> lot<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
once again but after all I need a lot of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.060 
once again but after all I need a lot of
lands<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.829> play<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:39.619> we're<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> try<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
lands in play and we're going to try to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.460 
lands in play and we're going to try to
build<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> threshold<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.780> far<00:01:43.020> wanderings

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
build up to threshold for far wanderings

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.500 
build up to threshold for far wanderings
and<00:01:43.890> fire<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.670> corrupt

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.020 

once<00:01:49.200> again<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.680> haven't<00:01:50.130> seen<00:01:50.370> strategic

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
once again we haven't seen strategic

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.340 
once again we haven't seen strategic
planning<00:01:51.300> we<00:01:51.660> haven't<00:01:51.960> seen<00:01:52.430> mulch<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
planning we haven't seen mulch and so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
planning we haven't seen mulch and so
getting<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.560> threshold<00:01:56.070> looks<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.850> that's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
getting the threshold looks like that's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.110 
getting the threshold looks like that's
going<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.630> most<00:01:57.780> difficult<00:01:57.960> part<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
going to be the most difficult part of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.790 
going to be the most difficult part of
this<00:02:00.120> game<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.720> would<00:02:01.260> have<00:02:01.320> liked<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> have

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
this game I would have liked to have

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.500 
this game I would have liked to have
considered<00:02:02.670> even<00:02:02.910> playing<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.450> our

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
considered even playing for our

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.800 
considered even playing for our
wanderings<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.550> without<00:02:05.550> threshold<00:02:06.240> but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
wanderings there without threshold but

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.450 
wanderings there without threshold but
once<00:02:07.020> again<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.290> need<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> keep<00:02:07.920> moment's<00:02:08.280> peace

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
once again I need to keep moment's peace

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.830 
once again I need to keep moment's peace
up<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.180> get<00:02:09.420> rites<00:02:09.720> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
up so that I don't get rites of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.080 
up so that I don't get rites of
initiation<00:02:09.960> out<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.220> game<00:02:15.770> go<00:02:16.770> fetch<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
initiation out of the game go fetch and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.760 
initiation out of the game go fetch and
since<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:18.690> already<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> flask<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
since we already have a flask on the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.690 
since we already have a flask on the
board<00:02:20.040> i'm<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.370> ahead<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.550> get

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
board i'm going to go ahead and get

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.900 
board i'm going to go ahead and get
another<00:02:20.970> island<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.990> case<00:02:22.500> i<00:02:22.710> drawn<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.310> plans

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.000 

but<00:02:26.910> instead<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.480> draw<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> sandstorm<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.770> so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
but instead we draw a sandstorm and so

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.300 
but instead we draw a sandstorm and so
at<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.190> point<00:02:29.460> what<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.300> want<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:31.310> get

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
at this point what we want to do is get

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.000 
at this point what we want to do is get
the<00:02:32.460> threshold<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.390> play<00:02:34.170> sandstorm<00:02:34.590> that's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the threshold and play sandstorm that's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.240 
the threshold and play sandstorm that's
our<00:02:35.370> only<00:02:35.850> real<00:02:36.360> objective<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:37.250> far

our only real objective here far

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.650 
our only real objective here far
wanderings<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.840> far<00:02:40.470> less<00:02:40.680> important<00:02:41.250> to

wanderings is far less important to
resolve<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:42.870> threshold<00:02:43.110> achieved<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.400> go

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
resolve with threshold achieved so we go

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.170 
resolve with threshold achieved so we go
just<00:02:45.080> fetch<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.220> swamp<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.459> would<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.790> liked<00:02:48.000> to

rather get full value from Mulder iftar
so<00:03:29.290> I'm<00:03:29.349> going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.709> go<00:03:29.980> ahead<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.609> cast

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
might just be a straight mistake we're

might just be a straight mistake we're
in<00:03:41.319> Game<00:03:41.530> three<00:03:41.560> he<00:03:41.950> most<00:03:42.370> likely<00:03:42.459> has

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
in Game three he most likely has

in Game three he most likely has
pyroblast<00:03:43.569> we<00:03:44.019> saw<00:03:44.230> pyroblast<00:03:45.510> game<00:03:46.510> to

pyroblast we saw pyroblast game to
actually<00:03:47.530> that's<00:03:47.709> what<00:03:48.060> killed<00:03:49.060> us<00:03:49.239> was<00:03:50.200> not

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
actually that's what killed us was not

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.289 
actually that's what killed us was not
being<00:03:50.650> able<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.950> play<00:03:51.219> a<00:03:51.250> Mulder<00:03:51.639> iftar<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:54.549> I

being able to play a Mulder iftar and I

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.580 
being able to play a Mulder iftar and I
probably<00:03:55.480> should<00:03:55.780> have<00:03:55.840> just<00:03:55.900> run<00:03:56.290> them<00:03:56.439> all

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
probably should have just run them all

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.580 
probably should have just run them all
drifter<00:03:57.010> into<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:58.000> pyroblast<00:03:58.719> however<00:03:59.260> my<00:03:59.379> hope

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
drifter into a pyroblast however my hope

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.729 
drifter into a pyroblast however my hope
here<00:03:59.919> is<00:04:00.099> that<00:04:00.340> will<00:04:00.639> force<00:04:00.909> them<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.680> try<00:04:02.680> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
here is that will force them to try to

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.830 
here is that will force them to try to
build<00:04:02.950> up<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.250> board<00:04:03.489> once<00:04:03.700> again<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.359> be

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
build up the board once again and be

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.420 
build up the board once again and be
