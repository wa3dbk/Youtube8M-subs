00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.650 
in this video I want to show you how to

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.430 
in this video I want to show you how to
install<00:00:08.010> unsigned<00:00:08.670> drivers<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.330> Windows<00:00:09.690> 7<00:00:10.080> 64

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
install unsigned drivers in Windows 7 64

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.730 
install unsigned drivers in Windows 7 64
bit<00:00:11.300> starting<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.420> Windows<00:00:12.719> Vista<00:00:12.750> 64-bit

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
bit starting with Windows Vista 64-bit

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.950 
bit starting with Windows Vista 64-bit
Microsoft<00:00:14.519> required<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.180> all<00:00:15.240> drivers<00:00:15.690> be

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
Microsoft required that all drivers be

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.679 
Microsoft required that all drivers be
digitally<00:00:16.410> signed<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.610> in<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.910> case<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.420> want

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
digitally signed so in this case I want

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.429 
digitally signed so in this case I want
to<00:00:18.779> install<00:00:18.960> my<00:00:19.230> iak<00:00:19.980> fan<00:00:20.369> GUI<00:00:20.730> utility<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:22.259> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
to install my iak fan GUI utility but it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.499 
to install my iak fan GUI utility but it
installs<00:00:22.829> a<00:00:22.919> driver<00:00:23.189> since<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.029> open<00:00:24.329> source

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
installs a driver since it's open source

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.839 
installs a driver since it's open source
or<00:00:24.810> free<00:00:24.840> where<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:26.009> driver<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> not<00:00:26.520> signed

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
or free where the driver is not signed

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.729 
or free where the driver is not signed
so<00:00:27.480> how<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.989> around<00:00:28.200> that<00:00:30.560> first<00:00:31.560> we're

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
so how do we get around that first we're

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.930 
so how do we get around that first we're

here's our fan GUI utility and like I

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.969 
here's our fan GUI utility and like I
said<00:05:55.030> this<00:05:55.300> is<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.449> great<00:05:55.690> app<00:05:55.900> for<00:05:55.979> managing

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
said this is a great app for managing

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.500 
said this is a great app for managing

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
have like an automatic control you can

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.810 
have like an automatic control you can
set<00:06:02.530> it<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.710> high<00:06:02.740> gives<00:06:03.430> you<00:06:03.520> all<00:06:03.669> the

on<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.630> what<00:06:08.229> speed<00:06:08.500> they<00:06:08.680> are<00:06:08.710> when<00:06:09.160> they<00:06:09.280> do

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
on and what speed they are when they do

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.730 
on and what speed they are when they do
come<00:06:09.669> on<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.210> I<00:06:11.200> can<00:06:11.440> change<00:06:11.590> it<00:06:11.710> to

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
come on and I can change it to

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.780 
come on and I can change it to
Fahrenheit<00:06:12.010> here<00:06:13.229> okay<00:06:14.229> go<00:06:15.070> back<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.280> that<00:06:15.550> and

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
Fahrenheit here okay go back to that and

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.490 
Fahrenheit here okay go back to that and
you'll<00:06:15.880> see<00:06:15.940> that<00:06:16.210> at<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.570> table<00:06:16.720> now<00:06:17.020> shows

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
you'll see that at the table now shows

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.820 
you'll see that at the table now shows
all<00:06:17.680> Fahrenheit<00:06:18.190> I<00:06:19.380> recommend<00:06:20.380> turning<00:06:20.530> mine

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
all Fahrenheit I recommend turning mine

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.760 
all Fahrenheit I recommend turning mine
on<00:06:21.040> at<00:06:21.370> a<00:06:21.400> slow<00:06:22.060> at<00:06:22.360> 100<00:06:22.870> degrees<00:06:23.200> and<00:06:23.530> I'll

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
on at a slow at 100 degrees and I'll

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.250 
on at a slow at 100 degrees and I'll
turn<00:06:23.889> it<00:06:24.040> on<00:06:24.070> high<00:06:24.250> and<00:06:24.460> 110<00:06:25.000> degrees<00:06:26.550> and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
turn it on high and 110 degrees and

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.379 
turn it on high and 110 degrees and
that's<00:06:29.260> about<00:06:29.380> it<00:06:29.530> now<00:06:30.280> this<00:06:30.639> will<00:06:30.880> work<00:06:31.060> on

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
that's about it now this will work on

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.439 
that's about it now this will work on
any<00:06:32.020> other<00:06:32.169> drivers<00:06:32.620> like<00:06:33.310> as<00:06:33.699> you<00:06:33.850> see<00:06:34.060> on<00:06:34.270> the

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
need to sign this should work the only

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.300 
need to sign this should work the only
thing<00:06:47.080> is<00:06:47.200> though<00:06:47.440> that<00:06:47.710> you'll<00:06:47.889> be<00:06:48.010> stuck

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
thing is though that you'll be stuck

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.460 
thing is though that you'll be stuck
leaving<00:06:49.000> it<00:06:49.120> in<00:06:49.270> that<00:06:49.479> word<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.139> the<00:06:50.229> bottom

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
leaving it in that word in the bottom

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.930 
leaving it in that word in the bottom
right<00:06:50.620> corner<00:06:50.650> where<00:06:51.070> it<00:06:51.099> says<00:06:51.220> test<00:06:51.729> mode

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940

windows<00:06:52.330> 7<00:06:52.750> to<00:06:53.650> me<00:06:53.770> that<00:06:53.919> doesn't<00:06:54.160> really

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
windows 7 to me that doesn't really

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.760 
windows 7 to me that doesn't really
bother<00:06:54.430> me<00:06:54.639> all<00:06:54.760> that<00:06:54.880> much<00:06:55.090> so<00:06:55.500> that's<00:06:56.500> pretty

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
bother me all that much so that's pretty

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.350 
bother me all that much so that's pretty
much<00:06:56.889> it<00:06:57.099> though<00:06:57.280> i<00:06:57.550> hope<00:06:57.700> you<00:06:57.849> like<00:06:58.000> my<00:06:58.120> video

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
much it though i hope you like my video

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.320
