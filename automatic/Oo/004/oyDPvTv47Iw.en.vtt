 how so 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.849
 percent 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.289
 asked why 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.219

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.519
 ml 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.989
 Wait a moment 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.989
 that's the way it works 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.739
 the cat lives absurd must wait 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.569

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.899
 is not that great 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.609
 for those pictures of it 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.669

 blind children are not higher than in Beijing 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.249
 In the end that would change so you have a burning log cabin 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.439
 but one more 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.909
 a flu vaccine is getting 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.579

 They say they can run and Sligo could do it too 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.869
 But it does not make me feel good. Weingarts I do not have 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.779
 a mess 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.819
 almost no peace 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.289

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.039
 Percent, why it has too little time 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.069
 yes okay I completely forgot 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.789
 Percent or not 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.729
 the normal time when i'm shit Hey thats i want 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.919

 Dahinden 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.340
 Yeah, right 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.039

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.039
 yes no, it is clear but also formal questions 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.740
 All next time I'll kill myself again 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.490
 honestly 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.389
 what the hell are you doing to kill yourself 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.659
 Of course you only have to drive from the last checkpoint 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.300
 So UniCredit expired smoother table to do it all over again 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.379

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.379
 do you understand? 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.400
 therefore 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.949
 there is nothing 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.419
 the coveted 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.419
 percentage points

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.439
