up<00:03:26.580> here<00:03:26.610> as<00:03:26.910> go<00:03:27.450> through<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.870> slot<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.610> what

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
up here as go through the slot and what

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.750 
up here as go through the slot and what
i<00:03:29.640> got<00:03:29.910> my<00:03:30.120> first<00:03:30.390> try<00:03:30.750> was<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.010> gas<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.610> what

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
i got my first try was the gas and what

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.970 
i got my first try was the gas and what
does<00:03:32.940> what<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.540> does<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.810> outside<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.680> map

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
does what that does is outside the map

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.120 
does what that does is outside the map
it<00:03:35.190> puts<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.970> whole<00:03:36.239> entire<00:03:36.420> gas<00:03:36.870> field<00:03:37.230> which

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
it puts a whole entire gas field which

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.240 
it puts a whole entire gas field which
kills<00:03:38.640> them<00:03:38.850> pretty<00:03:39.360> much<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.800> head<00:03:41.010> size

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
kills them pretty much in to head size

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.570 
kills them pretty much in to head size
you<00:03:41.459> see<00:03:41.640> come<00:03:42.360> in<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.720> hit<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.170> i<00:03:43.470> guess<00:03:44.340> that's

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
you see come in to hit so i guess that's

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.780 
you see come in to hit so i guess that's
okay<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.180> way<00:03:45.300> but<00:03:45.900> next<00:03:46.560> another<00:03:46.800> one<00:03:47.130> this

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
okay in a way but next another one this

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.150 
okay in a way but next another one this
is<00:03:47.940> all<00:03:48.090> random<00:03:48.330> by<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.630> way<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.890> one

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
is all random by the way and on this one

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.970 
is all random by the way and on this one
i<00:03:50.400> have<00:03:50.580> gotten<00:03:51.260> sentry<00:03:52.260> guns<00:03:52.470> which<00:03:52.709> what

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
i have gotten sentry guns which what

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.920 
i have gotten sentry guns which what
they<00:03:53.100> do<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.459> they<00:03:53.700> come<00:03:53.910> around<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.239> map<00:03:54.420> like

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
they do is they come around the map like

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.450 
they do is they come around the map like
randomly<00:03:55.410> if<00:03:55.590> i<00:03:55.709> put<00:03:55.980> their<00:03:56.390> right<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.480> there

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
randomly if i put their right in there

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.420 
randomly if i put their right in there
right<00:03:59.060> there<00:03:59.420> right<00:04:00.110> there<00:04:00.290> imma<00:04:01.220> kill<00:04:01.400> that

right there right there imma kill that
guy<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.850> over<00:04:02.690> here<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.110> there's<00:04:04.100> one<00:04:04.310> over

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
guy and over here and there's one over

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.080 
guy and over here and there's one over
there<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.740> won't<00:04:06.920> stay<00:04:07.160> long<00:04:07.340> they<00:04:07.610> stay<00:04:07.850> like

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
there it won't stay long they stay like

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.600 
there it won't stay long they stay like
just<00:04:08.330> about<00:04:08.450> 10<00:04:08.840> seconds<00:04:09.260> or<00:04:09.380> 15<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.520> they

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
just about 10 seconds or 15 and they

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.450 
just about 10 seconds or 15 and they
kill<00:04:10.820> people<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:12.200> next<00:04:12.440> one<00:04:12.740> that<00:04:13.160> you

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
kill people and the next one that you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.360 
kill people and the next one that you
could<00:04:13.640> get<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:16.750> dremel<00:04:17.920> everything<00:04:18.920> what

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
could get is a dremel everything what

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.090 
could get is a dremel everything what
this<00:04:19.520> does<00:04:19.700> is<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.970> causing<00:04:20.480> care<00:04:21.470> packages

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
this does is it causing care packages

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.300 
this does is it causing care packages
gases<00:04:22.880> everything<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:24.650> also<00:04:24.890> get<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
gases everything and you also get the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.190 
gases everything and you also get the
sentry<00:04:25.640> guns<00:04:25.850> everywhere<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.780> when<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.050> call

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
sentry guns everywhere so when you call

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.140 
sentry guns everywhere so when you call
in<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> care<00:04:27.590> packages<00:04:28.010> I'll<00:04:28.250> make<00:04:28.730> sure<00:04:28.940> that

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
in the care packages I'll make sure that

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.730 
in the care packages I'll make sure that
you<00:04:29.330> look<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.930> care<00:04:30.110> package<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.560> has

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
you look for the care package that has

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740 
you look for the care package that has
another<00:04:31.070> slot<00:04:31.400> machine<00:04:31.760> because<00:04:32.420> that<00:04:32.570> always

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
another slot machine because that always

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.810 
another slot machine because that always
happens<00:04:33.230> on<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.530> Y<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.340> guess<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.670> get

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
happens on the Y so you guess you get

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.200 
happens on the Y so you guess you get
another<00:04:35.120> chance<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:37.040> last<00:04:37.310> one<00:04:37.670> is<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
another chance and the last one is the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.420 
another chance and the last one is the
kem<00:04:41.900> strike<00:04:42.260> that's<00:04:42.500> right<00:04:42.710> there's<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:43.010> kem

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
kem strike that's right there's a kem

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.220 
kem strike that's right there's a kem
strike<00:04:43.760> in<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.060> map<00:04:44.270> but<00:04:44.600> it<00:04:44.810> does<00:04:45.050> not

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
strike in this map but it does not

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.320 
strike in this map but it does not
destroy<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.740> map<00:04:45.920> I<00:04:46.160> wish<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:46.850> did<00:04:47.030> I'll<00:04:47.210> be

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
destroy the map I wish you did I'll be

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.640 
destroy the map I wish you did I'll be
kind<00:04:47.510> of<00:04:47.570> cool<00:04:47.690> seeing<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.080> map<00:04:48.260> destroyed

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
kind of cool seeing this map destroyed

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.880 
kind of cool seeing this map destroyed
but<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:49.330> guess<00:04:50.330> that's<00:04:50.510> kind<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.780> cool<00:04:50.900> that's

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
but I guess that's kind of cool that's

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.410 
but I guess that's kind of cool that's
pretty<00:04:52.070> much<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.280> for<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.580> video<00:04:52.700> guys<00:04:53.030> thank
