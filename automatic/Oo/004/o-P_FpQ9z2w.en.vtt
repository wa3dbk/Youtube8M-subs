when I was doing this all right so there

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.950 
when I was doing this all right so there
we<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.030> can<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.210> keep<00:02:17.600> collecting

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
we go so you can just keep collecting

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.370 
we go so you can just keep collecting
this<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.770> tried<00:02:19.160> using<00:02:19.790> water<00:02:20.240> so<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.050> can<00:02:21.200> like

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
this I tried using water so you can like

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.490 
this I tried using water so you can like
float<00:02:21.620> down<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.210> didn't<00:02:23.600> work<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.200> i

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
float down here but it didn't work and i

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.190 
float down here but it didn't work and i
just<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.740> chests<00:02:25.430> here<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.510> put<00:02:27.140> it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
just have chests here so can like put it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.840 
just have chests here so can like put it
in<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.500> files<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.980> survival<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
in the files and survival so it's a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.760 
in the files and survival so it's a
really<00:02:29.120> cool<00:02:29.450> way<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:30.100> easily<00:02:31.100> get<00:02:31.550> meat<00:02:32.770> so

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
really cool way to easily get meat so

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.070 
really cool way to easily get meat so
let's<00:02:33.950> try<00:02:34.220> another<00:02:34.520> thing<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.300> chicken<00:02:35.840> a

let's try another thing a chicken a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.400 
let's try another thing a chicken a
creeper<00:02:37.060> we'll<00:02:38.060> try<00:02:38.210> a<00:02:38.240> zombie<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.810> actually

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
tap on the go block and it should spawn

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.170 
tap on the go block and it should spawn
hopefully<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.200> should<00:02:45.530> spawn<00:02:47.140> come<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.290> spawn
