 before continuing with this video tutorial 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.380
 I remind you that it is necessary to be 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.610
 backup of your fs folder as well 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.530
 in the android backup so that we avoid 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 Post-installation problems 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.830
 having said that you can download what 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.210
 which are the necessary files that you 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.510
 I'll leave in the description of the video and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.530
 copy them to your microsd memory and 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 subsequently enters record mode and in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.790
 this time we are going to put our 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 device we're going to pay and we're going to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.190
 enter into recovery mode to perform what 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.190
 which is the installation of the rom 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 once it has gone our 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 terminal we keep pressed the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.890
 volume volume up power and jon 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 simultaneously 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 we're 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.470
 let's wait for our recovery to load 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.580
 once we are in our recovery 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.080
 let's do what are the white 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.960
 personalized we will be directing 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.200
 where 16 dalvik h we are going to select 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 data and we will select the option that 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 mark us that cache are also 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.410
 translations will always be necessary 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.580
 to perform a clean installation 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.140
 the to get a better performance 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 in another device we are going to move 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.620
 here and let's hope that the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 formatting 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.310
 once formatting is complete 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.350
 we just check back we're going 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.180
 back and we're going to install our 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.340
 microsd memory where we have what it is 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.229
 the rom 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.439
 and we have euphoria we are going to enter the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.439
 rice 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.790
 once the process is finished 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.480
 install the rom let's proceed to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.480
 install the apps 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.750
 once you finish the process 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.240
 installation we just give you 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.800
 restart to our device 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.630
 we restart and hope that our 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.340
 terminal start what for the first time 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.290
 the rom and start doing what are the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.400
 relevant configurations to be able 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 use our device 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.110
 well as you can see we have already 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.610
 finished configuring what is the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.110
 rumba increase the application change and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 here we can visualize that simply 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.160
 we have what gas services are 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.540
 of google and some other application that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.430
 includes what the developer does not 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.140
 we go to adjustments we are going to move 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.120
 where is phone information here 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.640
 we can hire what is the version 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.680
 of android with which this is based 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.930
 rom and we can see that we have 5.1.1 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.489
 lollipop which is the latest version of 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.130
 Android available we can also see 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.140
 what is the date of the compilation of 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.940
 the rom and its version also and some 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.340
 other relevant information that can 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.860
 provide what the device we are going 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.209
 to close what is not the adjustments we 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.220
 we can find what are the adjustments 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.049
 stock does not bring additional adjustments to the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.790
 rom we can simply customize it 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.170
 in each of the sections that we 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.030
 provides the rice 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.950
 now we are going to visualize a section that 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.049
 we are very concerned that it is the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.090
 device resources we go here in 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.650
 execution here shows us a picture of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.840
 the device resources we can 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.760
 observe that we have 320 megabytes of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.489
 free ram memory which we can 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.859
 use in applications or in some 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.760
 some games that we can 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.770
 install on our device 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.410
 remember that most of the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.480
 Android versions she is geared 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.240
 for equipment with higher memory range so 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.980
 is that we will have to settle a little 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.300
 using this custom rom and 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.430
 we want to have what is ours 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.270
 device to the latest version of 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.060
 Andrew 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.230
 now I'm going in a look at the camera to 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.940
 custom the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.620
 and you can see that it works 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.599
 correctly does not have any problem 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.280
 You can also choose the camera 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.230
 additional camera is google if 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.819
 is that you have no longer there is a 12.1 mode 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.650
 since in that latest version of cyanogen 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.569
 there is a lot improved what is the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.239
 quality let's go in what are our 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.400
 wallpapers here we can see that 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.810
 those that are commonly we can see in 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.730
 cyanogenmod or also here we 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.350
 provides a package the rom of 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.090
 of funds from lack of which we can 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.090
 select the one you like 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.919
 now I enter the military section of 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.660
 tasks as we can observe here the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.300
 we have we want to clean up 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.150
 we just clean and now the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.490
 section of the status bar here not 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.710
 you have to tell them they already know everything how 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.210
 go this section in the status bar and 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.070
