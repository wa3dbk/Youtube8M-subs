so Eric what are we looking at here hey
here<00:00:33.590> we<00:00:33.620> look<00:00:33.980> at<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.550> output<00:00:35.030> of<00:00:35.270> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
here we look at the output of the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.960 
here we look at the output of the
utilization<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.470> under<00:00:36.800> be<00:00:36.860> on<00:00:37.040> fire<00:00:37.370> in

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
utilization of the under be on fire in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.090 
utilization of the under be on fire in
fact<00:00:38.240> this<00:00:38.390> morning<00:00:38.810> when<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.290> come<00:00:39.560> here<00:00:40.040> I

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
fact this morning when I come here I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.740 
fact this morning when I come here I
just<00:00:41.440> launched<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.680> bunch<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.160> jobs<00:00:43.490> using<00:00:44.060> PBS

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
just launched a bunch of jobs using PBS

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.440 
just launched a bunch of jobs using PBS
it's<00:00:45.470> more<00:00:45.710> than<00:00:45.770> 10k<00:00:46.430> jobs<00:00:46.790> that<00:00:47.180> we<00:00:47.330> have

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
it's more than 10k jobs that we have

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.510 
it's more than 10k jobs that we have
submitted<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:47.990> morning<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.860> then<00:00:49.220> we<00:00:49.400> have

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
submitted this morning and then we have

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.760 
submitted this morning and then we have
nothing<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:50.030> do<00:00:50.180> TBS<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.080> able<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.500> schedule

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
nothing to do TBS is able to schedule

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.700 
nothing to do TBS is able to schedule
the<00:00:52.610> jobs<00:00:52.640> one<00:00:53.300> after<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:53.810> others<00:00:54.110> on<00:00:54.350> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
the jobs one after the others on the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.120 
the jobs one after the others on the
xeon<00:00:54.980> phi<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:56.300> in<00:00:56.720> fact<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.079> here<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:57.920> can

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
xeon phi so in fact you here you can

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.880 
xeon phi so in fact you here you can
look<00:00:58.730> at<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.090> loading<00:00:59.329> okay<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:00.230> once<00:01:00.680> it's

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
look at the loading okay and once it's

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.970 
look at the loading okay and once it's
100<00:01:01.640> persons<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.810> means<00:01:03.110> that<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.410> two<00:01:03.710> card

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
100 persons this means that the two card

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.120 
100 persons this means that the two card
is<00:01:04.549> used<00:01:04.879> as<00:01:05.180> fulfilled<00:01:05.899> at<00:01:06.049> spoon<00:01:06.499> at<00:01:06.740> full

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
is used as fulfilled at spoon at full

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.539 
is used as fulfilled at spoon at full
speed<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.850> when<00:01:08.719> it<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:09.079> admitir<00:01:09.560> here<00:01:10.280> it's

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
speed and when it is a admitir here it's

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.849 
speed and when it is a admitir here it's
because<00:01:10.789> in<00:01:11.240> fact<00:01:11.390> we<00:01:11.600> run<00:01:11.780> two<00:01:12.020> jobs<00:01:12.319> a<00:01:12.499> big

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
because in fact we run two jobs a big

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.919 
because in fact we run two jobs a big
job<00:01:13.100> here<00:01:13.520> on<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.630> small<00:01:14.929> one<00:01:15.140> here<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.009> once

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
job here on the small one here so once

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.929 
job here on the small one here so once
1g<00:01:17.929> on<00:01:17.990> phi<00:01:18.259> is<00:01:18.499> able<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.159> run<00:01:19.310> another<00:01:19.549> job

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
1g on phi is able to run another job

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.440 
1g on phi is able to run another job
then<00:01:20.319> PBS<00:01:21.319> will<00:01:21.560> automatically<00:01:22.310> launch<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:23.179> on

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
then PBS will automatically launch it on

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.899 
then PBS will automatically launch it on
it<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:23.929> you<00:01:24.020> see<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.469> then<00:01:24.920> utilization

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
it and you see that then utilization

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.379 
it and you see that then utilization
keeps<00:01:26.299> going<00:01:26.569> up<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:27.289> one<00:01:27.439> hundred<00:01:27.469> percent<00:01:28.389> so

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
keeps going up to one hundred percent so

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.230 
keeps going up to one hundred percent so
what<00:01:30.380> application<00:01:31.039> is<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.639> showing<00:01:31.939> is<00:01:32.119> it

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
what application is this showing is it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.489 
what application is this showing is it
showing<00:01:32.420> us<00:01:32.569> results<00:01:32.899> from<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.289> real

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
showing us results from a real

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.559 
showing us results from a real
application<00:01:33.770> or<00:01:34.429> what<00:01:35.030> are<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:35.179> looking<00:01:35.450> at

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
application or what are we looking at

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.639 
application or what are we looking at
here<00:01:35.630> oh<00:01:35.810> yeah<00:01:36.049> sure<00:01:36.439> its<00:01:37.399> presence<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.649> radius

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
here oh yeah sure its presence of radius

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.719 
here oh yeah sure its presence of radius
radius<00:01:40.219> is<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.170> hand<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.439> simulation<00:01:43.399> tools

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
radius is a I hand a simulation tools

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.679 
radius is a I hand a simulation tools
used<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:44.810> solve<00:01:45.340> complex<00:01:46.340> simulations<00:01:47.119> so

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
used to solve complex simulations so

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.440 
used to solve complex simulations so
here<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:48.259> have<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:48.770> type<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.219> simulations<00:01:49.909> one

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
here you have to type of simulations one

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.739 
here you have to type of simulations one
is<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.659> car<00:01:50.959> crash<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.639> other<00:01:52.759> one<00:01:53.029> is<00:01:53.359> the

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
is a car crash on the other one is the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.719 
is a car crash on the other one is the
computation<00:01:54.499> on<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.859> boats<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.429> we<00:01:55.639> have

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
computation on the boats that we have

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.719 
computation on the boats that we have
realized<00:01:56.329> for<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:56.929> America's<00:01:57.740> Cup<00:01:57.770> few<00:01:58.520> years

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
realized for the America's Cup few years

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.080 
realized for the America's Cup few years
ago<00:02:00.039> so<00:02:01.039> you're<00:02:01.189> doing<00:02:01.369> some<00:02:01.520> kind<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:01.759> finite

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
ago so you're doing some kind of finite

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.050 
ago so you're doing some kind of finite
element<00:02:02.649> whatever<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:03.859> run<00:02:04.039> yes<00:02:04.249> exactly<00:02:04.700> is

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
element whatever you run yes exactly is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.199 
element whatever you run yes exactly is
a<00:02:05.149> finite<00:02:05.420> element<00:02:05.959> analysis<00:02:06.560> code<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.279> in

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
a finite element analysis code and in

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.900 
a finite element analysis code and in
fact<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.569> are<00:02:08.750> talking<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.679> two<00:02:10.220> solvers<00:02:10.670> on

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
fact we are talking to two solvers on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.330 
fact we are talking to two solvers on
jugs<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.330> fire<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.410> first<00:02:12.650> all-girls<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.190> we

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
jugs on fire the first all-girls that we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.430 
jugs on fire the first all-girls that we
have<00:02:13.460> caught<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.000> used

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
have caught it and used

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.480 
have caught it and used
here<00:02:14.920> cunning<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.150> implicit<00:02:16.590> solvers<00:02:17.590> so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
here cunning is the implicit solvers so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.200 
here cunning is the implicit solvers so
this<00:02:18.670> soul<00:02:18.850> burns<00:02:19.120> basically<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:21.210> used

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
this soul burns basically is is a used

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.170 
this soul burns basically is is a used
to<00:02:22.510> find<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.410> final<00:02:23.920> shape<00:02:24.190> here<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
to find the final shape here of the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.420 
to find the final shape here of the
whole<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.720> board<00:02:26.020> after<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.860> apply<00:02:27.160> some

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
whole of this board after we apply some

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.640 
whole of this board after we apply some
load<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.690> are<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.930> able<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.260> both

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
load on it so are you able to both

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.400 
load on it so are you able to both
implicit<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.670> explicit<00:02:30.730> yes<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:32.110> right

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
implicit and explicit yes that right

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.950 
implicit and explicit yes that right
yeah<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:32.860> why<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.640> here<00:02:33.970> it's<00:02:34.150> implicated

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
yeah and why and here it's implicated

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.130 
yeah and why and here it's implicated
okay<00:02:35.650> yea<00:02:36.010> unto<00:02:36.220> pot<00:02:36.640> implicit<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> Xeon

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
okay yea unto pot implicit on the Xeon

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.460 
okay yea unto pot implicit on the Xeon
Phi<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.950> use<00:02:39.130> offload<00:02:39.760> paralyzation<00:02:40.320> it's<00:02:41.320> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
Phi we use offload paralyzation it's a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.580 
Phi we use offload paralyzation it's a
model<00:02:41.800> like<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.340> little<00:02:42.760> bit<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.390> use<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.110> gpus

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
model like a little bit you use on gpus

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.040 
model like a little bit you use on gpus
that<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.400> use<00:02:45.580> your<00:02:45.790> oath<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.510> run<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
that is you use your oath to run the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.350 
that is you use your oath to run the
code<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:48.100> when<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.700> have<00:02:48.850> compute

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
code on then when you have compute

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.780 
code on then when you have compute
intensive<00:02:49.540> operation<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.160> use<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
intensive operation you can use the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.720 
intensive operation you can use the
design<00:02:52.090> file<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:53.170> run<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:54.310> compute

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
design file to run this compute

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.240 
design file to run this compute
intensive<00:02:54.850> colonel<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:57.040> something

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
intensive colonel so it's something

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.460 
intensive colonel so it's something
pretty<00:02:57.580> impressive<00:02:58.150> because<00:02:58.600> by<00:02:58.900> using<00:02:59.140> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
pretty impressive because by using the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.280 
pretty impressive because by using the
Xeon<00:02:59.740> Phi<00:02:59.770> with<00:03:00.520> radios<00:03:01.090> we<00:03:01.600> are<00:03:01.720> able<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.020> get

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
Xeon Phi with radios we are able to get

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.670 
Xeon Phi with radios we are able to get
a<00:03:02.350> 2.5<00:03:03.070> speed<00:03:03.730> up<00:03:03.880> which<00:03:04.420> means<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.900> using

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
a 2.5 speed up which means that using

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.220 
a 2.5 speed up which means that using
the<00:03:05.860> Xeon<00:03:06.100> Phi<00:03:06.130> plastic<00:03:07.030> zone<00:03:07.210> host<00:03:07.750> it's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the Xeon Phi plastic zone host it's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.520 
the Xeon Phi plastic zone host it's
possible<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.980> go<00:03:09.160> faster<00:03:09.820> 2.5<00:03:10.750> compared<00:03:11.410> to
