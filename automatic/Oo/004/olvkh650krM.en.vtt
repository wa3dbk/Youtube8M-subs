00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
was a carrying case I believe they

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.590 
was a carrying case I believe they
should<00:02:23.130> have<00:02:23.220> offered<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.700> carrying<00:02:24.360> case<00:02:24.570> for

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
should have offered a carrying case for

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.440 
should have offered a carrying case for
these<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:26.490> they<00:02:26.640> were<00:02:26.850> shown<00:02:27.060> on<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
these but like they were shown on the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.880 
these but like they were shown on the
videos<00:02:27.750> really<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.740> good<00:02:29.010> quality<00:02:29.540> clamps

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
videos really really good quality clamps

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.130 
videos really really good quality clamps
almost<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.010> good<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.310> quality<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:33.000> my<00:02:33.360> jumper

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
almost as good as quality as my jumper

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.860 
almost as good as quality as my jumper
pack<00:02:34.610> I've<00:02:35.610> had<00:02:35.850> genius<00:02:36.240> products<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
pack I've had genius products in the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.630 
pack I've had genius products in the
past<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.440> that's<00:02:37.710> why<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> chose<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.520> go<00:02:38.610> with

the genius one as well but I don't know
what<00:02:42.540> I'm<00:02:42.630> gonna<00:02:42.750> jump<00:02:42.930> start<00:02:43.170> first<00:02:43.440> with

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
what I'm gonna jump start first with

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.820 
what I'm gonna jump start first with
this<00:02:43.940> see<00:02:44.940> exactly<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.780> road<00:02:46.050> kings<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
this see exactly like road kings and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.120 
this see exactly like road kings and
everyone<00:02:47.550> else's<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.210> has<00:02:48.420> all<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> options

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
everyone else's it has all the options

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.180 
everyone else's it has all the options
it's<00:02:50.750> that's<00:02:51.750> not<00:02:51.810> fully<00:02:52.140> charged<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.100> I'm

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
it's that's not fully charged so I'm

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.860 
it's that's not fully charged so I'm
actually<00:02:53.280> gonna<00:02:53.550> hook<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.820> up<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.090> my<00:02:54.120> jumper

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
actually gonna hook it up to my jumper

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.350 
actually gonna hook it up to my jumper
pack<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.950> charge<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.430> also<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.090> charge

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
pack to charge it also you can charge

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.640 
pack to charge it also you can charge
these<00:02:57.660> through<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.550> car<00:03:00.320> there<00:03:01.320> should<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
these through a car there should be a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.500 
these through a car there should be a
car<00:03:01.890> adapter<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.520> here<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.910> may<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.150> dropped

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
car adapter in here I may have dropped

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:15.200 
car adapter in here I may have dropped
it<00:03:03.780> off<00:03:12.230> there<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.520> basically<00:03:14.520> just<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.970> car

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
it off there this basically just the car

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.250 
it off there this basically just the car
adapter<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.960> USB<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:17.520> um<00:03:17.730> or<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.780> can<00:03:18.900> imagine

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
adapter to USB but um or you can imagine

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.170 
adapter to USB but um or you can imagine
you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.620> charge<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.920> through<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.100> computer<00:03:20.580> but

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
you can charge it through a computer but

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.850 
you can charge it through a computer but
imagine<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.570> would<00:03:21.690> put<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> drain<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
imagine it would put a drain on the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.160 
imagine it would put a drain on the
power<00:03:22.890> supply<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.520> not<00:03:23.700> sure<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.660> dumb<00:03:24.870> here

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
power supply I'm not sure but dumb here

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.290 
power supply I'm not sure but dumb here
it<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.380> like<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.340> said<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.550> don't<00:03:26.670> know<00:03:26.850> one<00:03:27.090> one

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
it is like I said I don't know one one

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.530 
it is like I said I don't know one one
jump<00:03:27.540> start<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.110> first<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:30.150> going

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
jump start with it first but I'm going

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.190 
jump start with it first but I'm going
to<00:03:30.600> use<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.050> for<00:03:31.290> my<00:03:32.360> basic<00:03:33.360> carry<00:03:33.720> around<00:03:33.870> my

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to use it for my basic carry around my

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.890 
to use it for my basic carry around my
travel<00:03:34.860> bag<00:03:35.040> whenever<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.090> at<00:03:36.209> work<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.720> if

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
travel bag whenever I'm at work so if

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.630 
travel bag whenever I'm at work so if
the<00:03:37.020> trucks<00:03:37.290> battery<00:03:37.680> ever<00:03:37.860> goes<00:03:38.130> dead

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the trucks battery ever goes dead

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.580 
the trucks battery ever goes dead
I'll<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.390> with<00:03:39.630> me<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.020> small<00:03:40.320> enough

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I'll have this with me it's small enough

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.420 
I'll have this with me it's small enough
to<00:03:40.770> travel<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.650> lot<00:03:43.830> easier<00:03:44.010> to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
to travel with and it's a lot easier to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.699 
to travel with and it's a lot easier to
carry<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:46.140> there's<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.440> carry

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
carry on this then there's to carry

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.460 
carry on this then there's to carry
around<00:03:46.890> my<00:03:47.220> large<00:03:47.700> jumper<00:03:48.120> pack<00:03:48.300> also<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:49.230> this

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
around my large jumper pack also if this

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.560 
around my large jumper pack also if this
there's<00:03:49.890> no<00:03:50.010> real<00:03:50.280> risk<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.850> dropping<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
there's no real risk of it dropping and

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.930 
there's no real risk of it dropping and
if<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.780> does<00:03:51.959> drop<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:53.070> in<00:03:53.340> its<00:03:53.520> own<00:03:53.610> plastic

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
if it does drop it's in its own plastic

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.860 
if it does drop it's in its own plastic
case<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.820> drop<00:03:57.270> proof<00:03:57.570> and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
case so it's it's it's drop proof and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.370 
case so it's it's it's drop proof and
also<00:03:58.290> they've<00:03:58.620> showed<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.100> being<00:03:59.310> drove<00:03:59.910> over

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
also they've showed it being drove over

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.160 
also they've showed it being drove over
dropped<00:04:01.380> then<00:04:01.800> driven<00:04:02.100> over<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.020> only

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
dropped then driven over but the only

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.600 
dropped then driven over but the only
thing<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.620> imagine<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.310> really<00:04:05.459> be

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
thing I imagine you have to really be

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.790 
thing I imagine you have to really be
careful<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.480> this<00:04:06.840> connector<00:04:07.410> end<00:04:07.590> right

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
careful of is this connector end right

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.920 
careful of is this connector end right
here<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.700> looks<00:04:08.760> like<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.239> really<00:04:09.570> good<00:04:09.690> quality

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
here it looks like a really good quality

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.130 
here it looks like a really good quality
connector<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.910> um<00:04:12.180> yeah<00:04:12.540> that's<00:04:12.690> pretty<00:04:13.020> much

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
connector but um yeah that's pretty much

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.319 
connector but um yeah that's pretty much
it<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.530> my<00:04:13.770> quick<00:04:14.280> unboxing<00:04:14.520> of<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.510> genius

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.920 

g/b<00:04:19.329> 30<00:04:19.689> boost<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.419> told<00:04:22.599> my<00:04:22.720> neighbor

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
g/b 30 boost and I just told my neighbor

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.119 
g/b 30 boost and I just told my neighbor
about<00:04:23.229> this<00:04:23.439> he<00:04:23.590> couldn't<00:04:23.800> believe<00:04:23.979> that

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:24.129 
about this he couldn't believe that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
something this small could be a booster

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.800 
something this small could be a booster
