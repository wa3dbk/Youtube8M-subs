00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
only reason alone it is because I got

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.310 
only reason alone it is because I got
something<00:00:51.250> cool<00:00:51.370> in<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.550> care<00:00:51.700> package<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:53.140> is

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
something cool in a care package this is

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.380 
something cool in a care package this is
the<00:00:53.440> second<00:00:53.829> half<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:54.640> think<00:00:55.000> it's<00:00:55.180> add<00:00:55.270> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
the second half I think it's add the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.490 
the second half I think it's add the
second<00:00:55.750> tower<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:56.050> over<00:00:56.289> time<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.550> two

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
second tower is over time one of the two

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.810 
second tower is over time one of the two
overtime<00:00:59.500> oh<00:00:59.620> because<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.129> time<00:01:00.340> limit<00:01:00.640> seems

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
overtime oh because the time limit seems

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.150 
overtime oh because the time limit seems
to<00:01:00.910> be<00:01:00.969> really<00:01:01.090> short<00:01:01.590> or<00:01:02.590> that<00:01:02.770> just<00:01:02.980> maybe

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
to be really short or that just maybe

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.710
