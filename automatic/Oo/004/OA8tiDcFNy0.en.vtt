00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.450
 The necking process can vary depending on the system temperatures 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.400
 used fuel 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.640
 Under pressure in the exhaust system and weather conditions take different lengths 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.630
 in general, from lighting to full operational readiness 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.869
 of the filled Lugano as one hundred and forty-five for about 30 to 50 minutes 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.949
 At first the heavy radiator and then the early mold are heavily loaded 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.239
 the exhaust fan starts with the compact switch on the Perth MINT 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.500
 Fulfilling feelings yourself 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 now the evil is rising and finally more air intake is inaccurate 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 Check contamination and clean it if necessary 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.230
 Now the paper is laid loose in the forum 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 and then from the area lying to match in longitudinal direction an 8 to 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.819
 10 centimeters high location 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.600
 Red comes in the movie 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.080
 For the dance five process should be a mixture of BÃ¶nen and middle 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.700
 Logs are used 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 ideally mainly made of softwood 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.400
 to achieve a uniform burning makes it possible to reach a layered wood 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
 it is recommended 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.940
 one in each corner, for example, a grill lighter 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 to position and ignite them 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.560
 now the leadership is ranked for in the last position of the security team 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.360
 After about 15 to 20 minutes, the material ignited in his 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 Combustion stabilized 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.000
 make sure before the subsequent nightlife that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.940
 sufficient drinking water is available even ten centimeters above the stones 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.520
 is because otherwise the fire can be stifled by the afterlife 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.100
 in the next step occupied room with medium-sized logs 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.770
 even a quarter full 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 how much room will be left for the next six to five minutes 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 filed the rest position of the security team 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.930
 Now spring can come completely with logs 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.030
 be filled 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.950
 leaving about five inches too high upper edge of the cavity 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.110
 should be 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.759
 after close the five-door 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.479
 Candy heats flap to be closed 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.759
 now the Lugano 50 made the intended use of leave that 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.249
 also by a slight humming noise and the flame in the show run 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.659
 the combustion chamber can be seen 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.969
 If the flames burn down only briefly, that is the clues 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.049
 To open some more time to create a larger amount of wood gas 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.539
 to let 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.929
 Keep in mind that when using logs with large edge length 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.449
 more air between the leaving and thus also a smaller one 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.339
 fuel mass can be sent to the footwell 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:41.679
 for that reason 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.089
 she regrets the burnup time is reduced 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.479
 too big gap 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.539
 between logs also adversely affects that 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 Combustion processes that colorful and a fire 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.469
 if, on the other hand, the wood is too tightly packed 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.620
 through the use of practical switch 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.229
 Boards or wood sections 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.299
 There is too little room for gases 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.159
 and the combustion process is hampered 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.749
 In the ideal case, a refill should be done after about four hours 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.749
 Brydon Ka content almost completely burned 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.209
 to reload is first on the radiator 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.789
 and then the escape eyes will only open until discovered 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.269
 so only a little air jumps into the interior 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.159
 After a short wait, the earlier may open for ladies slowly 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.659
 too fast opening the doors led Granzow abrupt 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.239
 Ignition of wood alleys 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.510
 Generally, a frequent opening leads to "he fills in for that too bad 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.829
 combustion results 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.900
 the working principle of the lower one is disturbed from fire 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.189
 The fire can be through this process 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.409
 also the Cobra wood layers converter 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.459
 As a result, eating more wood than intended takes part in the incineration 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.019
 when reloading, cloudy logs quickly reduce the cover 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.060
 emerge from hot-gas lanes coming out of the movie
