00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.410
 pantene let's see in this video how 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.760
 recover the hair as for the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.769
 hydration you can do a thousand 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.110
 easy treatments at home you have to 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.700
 have a routine to know your type of 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.340
 hair and know how to use the products 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.680
 suitable to this type of hair in the case 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.730
 of dora that has fine hair 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.439
 it needs hydration because it came to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.540
 dehydrated hair especially in the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.310
 tips and we have used the collection 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.890
 Water light is special for fine hair 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.170
 to hydrate nourish give a lot of shine 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.149
 but without weighing down leaving hair with 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.310
 a lot of movement we have washed your hair 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.620
 with the aqualight shampoo we have used the 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.350
 Mask applying the strand to strand 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.180
 in a generous amount and you can do 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 several things so that the mask 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.800
 penetrate more in the hair you can use the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.380
 classic trick of the hot towel that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.660
 is to place a towel in very water 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.520
 Warmly wrap your hair and leave it like that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.260
 10 minutes is much easier than 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.690
 it seems you can do it even in the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.460
 You do not have to leave a shower more 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.610
 10 minutes until the towel cools 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.100
 and this makes the hair look much more 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.940
 silky and in addition you will keep the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 movement in your hair why 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.960
 It gives weight is very light if you have the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.940
 thick hair you can use for example 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.540
 repair and protect or if you have hair 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.190
 colored collection color protect 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.050
 another trick to keep our hair in 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.000
 way is to use the treatments without 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.280
 clarified that we protect our hair to the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.110
 drying time and give an extra 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.660
 hydration in the case of dora as it is 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.030
 fine hair we use the nutritious spray 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.010
 aqualight of pantene must be shaken 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 so that all its components join and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.320
 we can apply it directly on the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.760
 hair from ends to ends to give 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 hydration and how to seal these 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.120
 tips I like a lot too 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.700
 apply it in my hands and work the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.649
 product 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.659
 on the hair, strand by strand and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.789
 insisting on the tips then what 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.369
 you can air dry or with a hairdryer 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.260
 Irons tongs this will protect your 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.630
 heat hair 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.820
 with already dry hair another of the tricks 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.830
 so that the tip is well sealed is 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.410
 use our treatment without rinsing 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.530
 our hands 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.140
 and we refresh the tips a little bit is a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.450
 little does the effect of serum but of a 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.280
 We can take it very lightly in 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.290
 our bag and freshen our hair 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.870

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.460
 of weight and with the tricks that I taught you
