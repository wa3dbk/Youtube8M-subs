00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.819
 infrared saunas came to us from 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.860
 Japan in America they appeared as 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.690
 patented equipment for 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.670
 warming newborns including 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.460
 weakened premature babies today 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.960
 after japan america europe fashion 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.150
 this high-tech equipment 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.710
 I came to Russia at the heart of this new 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 wellness equipment lies 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.000
 direct heating of the human body 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.949
 infrared heat rays thermal 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.320
 the waves pass through the air practically 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.019
 without heating it penetrate deep into the body 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.999
 15-20 centimeters due to this 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.710
 effects on the entire body and in 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.170
 very mild temperature conditions in 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 the sauna does not exceed 60 degrees 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 what is the temperature in traditional russian 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 bath and Finnish sauna 90 120 degrees 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.319
 Celsius agree there is a difference 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.149
 infrared sauna due to the fact that 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.699
 its temperature is not so high 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.170
 tolerated by the body much easier 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.389
 thereby reducing the risk 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.109
 respiratory trauma contraction 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:04.369
 vascular and as a result dizziness and 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.620
 perspiration does not begin immediately but 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.450
 on the contrary begins a little bit removed 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.990
 later end of procedure 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.119
 due to this there is no such pronounced 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 effects on abrupt vessel walls 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.869
 ceiling floor infrared saunas are made 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.909
 from classic rocks for Russia 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.039
 linden wood and aspen wood they 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.929
 heating emit air rums micro 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.860
 particles which are particularly useful for 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.170
 respiratory organs 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.270
 the procedure lasts no more than 30 minutes of this 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.920
 enough to completely warm the whole 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.770
 body warming 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.929
 layers of deep and subcutaneous tissue 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.719
 muscle layers due to exposure 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.110
 red muscles relax spasm 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:46.409
 removed small vessels melted 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 enlarged subcutaneous capillary network 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.009
 layers 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.810
 this reduces the pressure to walk 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.399
 in the infrared sauna can all outside 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 depending on age full 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.810
 complexion and adults and children and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.789
 regular often can not be said about 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.619
 classical sauna and bath which 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.789
 a person is exposed to very tough 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.170
 thermal stress 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.720
 true and there are their 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 Contraindications this is different 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.920
 cancer is 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.980
 complicated heart disease 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.000
 vascular 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.159
 and the last low frequencies and low 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.690
 radiation level guarantee full 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.549
 electromagnetic safety 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.440
 infrared saunas for all living 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.280
 organisms take note and 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.280
 be healthy
