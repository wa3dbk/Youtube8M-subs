00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:03.009 
hey guys now I'm at a friend's house and

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.820 
hey guys now I'm at a friend's house and
they've<00:00:03.999> got<00:00:04.180> some<00:00:04.480> this<00:00:04.779> is<00:00:04.870> Ivy<00:00:05.290> geranium

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
they've got some this is Ivy geranium

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.000 
they've got some this is Ivy geranium
and<00:00:06.009> these<00:00:06.430> two<00:00:06.640> pots<00:00:07.560> different<00:00:08.560> to<00:00:08.710> normal

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
and these two pots different to normal

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.460 
and these two pots different to normal
geranium<00:00:09.670> that<00:00:09.850> grows<00:00:10.060> like<00:00:10.300> a<00:00:10.330> bush<00:00:10.630> Ivy

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.470 
geranium that grows like a bush Ivy

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.050 
geranium that grows like a bush Ivy
geranium<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:12.040> guess<00:00:12.190> as<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.370> name<00:00:12.640> suggests

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.060 
geranium I guess as the name suggests

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.690 
geranium I guess as the name suggests
grows<00:00:13.360> as<00:00:13.720> a<00:00:13.900> climber<00:00:14.200> now<00:00:14.920> they<00:00:15.280> wanted<00:00:15.640> to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
grows as a climber now they wanted to

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.160 
grows as a climber now they wanted to
grow<00:00:15.910> more<00:00:16.240> because<00:00:16.540> they<00:00:16.600> want<00:00:16.780> to<00:00:16.810> put<00:00:16.990> it<00:00:17.080> in

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
grow more because they want to put it in

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.110 
grow more because they want to put it in
different<00:00:17.320> areas<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.040> I<00:00:18.490> was<00:00:18.610> talking<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:19.000> him

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
different areas and I was talking to him

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.610 
different areas and I was talking to him
about<00:00:19.150> propagating<00:00:19.780> and<00:00:20.140> all<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.350> kind<00:00:20.560> of

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.620 
about propagating and all that kind of

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.390 
about propagating and all that kind of
stuff<00:00:20.860> and<00:00:21.070> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:22.630> they<00:00:22.750> were<00:00:22.840> kind<00:00:22.990> of

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
stuff and I think they were kind of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.550 
stuff and I think they were kind of
saying<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.550> me<00:00:24.640> like<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:25.510> know<00:00:25.630> propagating

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
saying to me like you know propagating

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.320 
saying to me like you know propagating
they're<00:00:26.890> not<00:00:27.010> real<00:00:27.310> gardeners<00:00:27.820> and<00:00:28.060> you<00:00:28.210> know

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
they're not real gardeners and you know

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.019 
they're not real gardeners and you know
whatever<00:00:29.260> I<00:00:29.320> said<00:00:29.529> look<00:00:29.650> I'm<00:00:30.580> going<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.820> do<00:00:31.000> a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
whatever I said look I'm going to do a

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.419 
whatever I said look I'm going to do a
propagating<00:00:31.930> series<00:00:32.409> on<00:00:32.619> youtube<00:00:33.129> at

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:33.429 
propagating series on youtube at

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:35.040 
propagating series on youtube at
different<00:00:33.760> aspects<00:00:34.089> so<00:00:34.539> this<00:00:34.749> is<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> good

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
different aspects so this is a good

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.139 
different aspects so this is a good
example<00:00:36.039> good<00:00:36.339> way<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.519> start<00:00:36.760> off<00:00:36.940> with

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
example good way to start off with

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.180 
example good way to start off with
because<00:00:37.300> propagating<00:00:38.289> geranium<00:00:39.069> in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
because propagating geranium in

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.739 
because propagating geranium in
particular<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.670> probably<00:00:39.909> the<00:00:40.030> easiest<00:00:40.179> thing

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
particular is probably the easiest thing

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.889 
particular is probably the easiest thing
to<00:00:40.929> do<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.280> if<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:42.670> kill<00:00:42.909> off<00:00:43.089> geranium<00:00:43.659> in

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
to do so if you kill off geranium in

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.649 
to do so if you kill off geranium in
your<00:00:44.019> garden<00:00:44.379> you're<00:00:44.949> doing<00:00:45.129> something<00:00:45.339> wrong

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
your garden you're doing something wrong

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.899 
your garden you're doing something wrong
with<00:00:46.659> your<00:00:46.870> garden<00:00:47.229> that's<00:00:47.379> really<00:00:47.679> easy<00:00:47.909> so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
with your garden that's really easy so

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.559 
with your garden that's really easy so
I'm<00:00:49.749> just<00:00:50.109> going<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.289> quickly<00:00:50.559> show<00:00:50.679> you<00:00:51.569> what

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
I'm just going to quickly show you what

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.349 
I'm just going to quickly show you what
to<00:00:52.809> do<00:00:52.960> now<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.699> can<00:00:54.850> see<00:00:54.999> there's<00:00:55.179> a<00:00:55.210> couple

and<00:01:53.200> I'll<00:01:53.409> give<00:01:53.590> this<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.770> water<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:56.229> it

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
and I'll give this a water and that's it

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.770 
and I'll give this a water and that's it
so<00:01:57.130> some<00:01:57.520> things<00:01:57.549> could<00:01:57.909> be<00:01:57.969> propagated<00:01:58.659> as

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
so some things could be propagated as

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.749 
so some things could be propagated as
easy<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.259> that<00:01:59.289> so<00:01:59.920> I'll<00:02:00.039> do<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.219> series<00:02:00.490> I'm

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
easy is that so I'll do a series I'm

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.739 
easy is that so I'll do a series I'm
going<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.939> go<00:02:01.030> through<00:02:01.270> all<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.539> different

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
going to go through all the different

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.200 
going to go through all the different
ways<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.350> know<00:02:02.409> how<00:02:02.829> to<00:02:02.890> propagate<00:02:03.210> now

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
ways that I know how to propagate now

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.389 
ways that I know how to propagate now
I'll<00:02:04.390> give<00:02:04.749> this<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:05.020> water<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.219> really

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
I'll give this a water and if you really

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.499 
I'll give this a water and if you really
want<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.729> be<00:02:06.789> on<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.939> safe<00:02:07.119> side<00:02:07.149> you'd

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
want to be on the safe side you'd

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.510 
want to be on the safe side you'd
probably<00:02:07.689> do<00:02:07.899> about<00:02:07.990> four<00:02:08.380> or<00:02:08.500> five<00:02:08.710> strike

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
probably do about four or five strike

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.160 
probably do about four or five strike
rates<00:02:09.790> can<00:02:10.060> vary<00:02:10.090> some<00:02:10.570> people<00:02:10.840> get<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:10.990> hundred

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
rates can vary some people get a hundred

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.530 
rates can vary some people get a hundred
percent<00:02:11.410> most<00:02:12.310> people<00:02:12.610> get<00:02:12.730> about

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
percent most people get about

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.570 
percent most people get about
between<00:02:14.019> 60<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.500> 80<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:15.189> good<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.489> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
between 60 and 80 so it's good to have a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.339 
between 60 and 80 so it's good to have a
few<00:02:15.849> in<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.689> you're<00:02:17.230> not

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
few in so then you you're not

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.039 
few in so then you you're not
disappointed<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.099> they<00:02:18.220> all<00:02:18.370> die<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.900> that's

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
disappointed if they all die so that's

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.160 
disappointed if they all die so that's
for<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.650> example<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:22.180> Ivy<00:02:22.689> geranium

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
for this one example for Ivy geranium

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.530 
for this one example for Ivy geranium
for<00:02:23.890> propagating<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.610> just<00:02:24.790> easy<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.269> that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
for propagating it's just easy as that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.089 
for propagating it's just easy as that
you<00:02:26.079> don't<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.920> same

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
you don't have to have it in the same

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.949 
you don't have to have it in the same
pot<00:02:27.370> because<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.849> if<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.420> does<00:02:28.629> grow<00:02:28.900> you

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
pot because you if it does grow you

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.420 
pot because you if it does grow you
might<00:02:29.349> not<00:02:29.530> want<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.890> grow<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.159> the<00:02:30.220> same

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
might not want it to grow in the same

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.649 
might not want it to grow in the same
box<00:02:30.640> you're<00:02:30.909> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> have<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.269> dig<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.599> up

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
box you're going to have to dig it up

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.360 
box you're going to have to dig it up
again<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.019> do<00:02:32.260> want<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:32.470> disturb<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.190> roots

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
again you do want to disturb the roots

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.550 
again you do want to disturb the roots
of<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.670> other<00:02:33.790> plant<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.170> put<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.470> in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
of the other plant so you just put it in

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.860 
of the other plant so you just put it in
another<00:02:35.680> pot<00:02:36.099> keep<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.909> watered<00:02:37.299> give<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
another pot keep it watered give it a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.170 
another pot keep it watered give it a
feed<00:02:38.079> if<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.379> really<00:02:38.650> want<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.190> that's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
feed if you really want to and that's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.720 
feed if you really want to and that's
basically<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.840> it'll<00:02:41.500> grow<00:02:41.650> from<00:02:41.920> there<00:02:42.129> one

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
basically it it'll grow from there one

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.349 
basically it it'll grow from there one
of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.909> toughest<00:02:43.359> perennials<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.109> can<00:02:44.260> get

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
of the toughest perennials you can get

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.020 
of the toughest perennials you can get
and<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.709> might<00:02:47.890> turn<00:02:48.129> these<00:02:48.310> around<00:02:48.340> after<00:02:48.970> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
and I might turn these around after I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.339 
and I might turn these around after I
finish<00:02:49.299> filming<00:02:49.329> too<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:49.989> it's<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.260> actually

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
finish filming too so it's to actually

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.930 
finish filming too so it's to actually
go<00:02:50.650> climbing<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.250> wall<00:02:51.430> they've<00:02:51.639> let<00:02:51.819> them

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
go climbing on the wall they've let them

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.059 
go climbing on the wall they've let them
climb<00:02:52.209> out<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.750> way<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.409> car<00:02:53.709> onto<00:02:53.950> the

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
climb out this way to the car onto the

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.319 
climb out this way to the car onto the
footpath<00:02:54.750> cool<00:02:56.129> alright<00:02:57.129> and<00:02:57.370> yeah<00:02:58.030> like<00:02:58.209> I

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
footpath cool alright and yeah like I

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.220 
footpath cool alright and yeah like I
said<00:02:58.480> I'm<00:02:58.569> going<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.870> some<00:02:59.049> more<00:02:59.200> on

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
said I'm going to do some more on

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.020 
said I'm going to do some more on
different<00:02:59.739> propagation<00:03:00.040> methods<00:03:00.730> as<00:03:00.879> well

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
different propagation methods as well

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.809 
different propagation methods as well
but<00:03:01.389> that's<00:03:01.569> probably<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.200> most<00:03:02.319> basic<00:03:02.819> form

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
but that's probably the most basic form

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.289 
but that's probably the most basic form
you<00:03:04.120> can<00:03:04.269> get<00:03:04.480> just<00:03:05.379> cutting<00:03:05.680> off<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.829> branch

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you can get just cutting off a branch

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.399 
you can get just cutting off a branch
leaving<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.389> little<00:03:07.569> bit<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.810> foliage<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.319> the

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
leaving a little bit of foliage at the

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.379 
leaving a little bit of foliage at the
top<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.889> long<00:03:09.099> stem<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:10.090> just

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
top and a long stem and then just

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.319 
top and a long stem and then just
planning<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.139> ground<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.909> doesn't<00:03:13.239> get

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
planning it in the ground it doesn't get

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.960 
planning it in the ground it doesn't get
any<00:03:13.450> easier<00:03:13.889> cool<00:03:14.889> alright<00:03:15.609> thanks<00:03:15.940> for

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
any easier cool alright thanks for

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.649 
any easier cool alright thanks for
watching<00:03:16.299> guys

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659
