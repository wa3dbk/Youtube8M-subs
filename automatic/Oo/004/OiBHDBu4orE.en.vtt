on<00:00:24.630> fire<00:00:25.970> I'm<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.180> sure<00:00:27.240> where<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.720> no

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
on fire I'm not sure where it is no

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
on fire I'm not sure where it is no
maybe<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> glitch<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.420> something<00:00:30.650> um

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
maybe just like a glitch or something um

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
maybe just like a glitch or something um
so<00:00:32.340> anyways<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.420> blocks<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:33.989> are

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so anyways with these blocks here are

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.610 
so anyways with these blocks here are
cold<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:35.130> called<00:00:35.730> ash<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.260> he<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
cold they are called ash so as he you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400 
cold they are called ash so as he you
can<00:00:37.770> break<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.420> basically<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.899> slippery

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
can break it and basically it's slippery

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.250 
can break it and basically it's slippery
because<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> hear<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.960> can't<00:00:43.200> even

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
because I see if I hear you can't even

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
because I see if I hear you can't even
get<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> jump<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.390> will

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
get on it so if you jump on it it will

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
get on it so if you jump on it it will
push<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:45.870> off<00:00:46.079> onto<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.739> near<00:00:47.399> blight

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
push you right off onto a near blight

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.709 
push you right off onto a near blight
block<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.870> doesn't<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
block that doesn't have that so so you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.830 
block that doesn't have that so so you
can't<00:00:51.930> even<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:53.420> take<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> no

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
can't even get on it or take it on it no

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.330
