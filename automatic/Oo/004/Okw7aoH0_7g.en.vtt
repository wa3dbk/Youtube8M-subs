00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.250
 Hand 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:53.290
 A registration has been distributed only 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:57.570
 It is not something that makes you feel so four wheeled on you 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.570

 Ferrari is said to be earning with engine memory 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.170

 I am running to the state while sliding smoothly 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.650
 I guess you feel like that 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.340
 It's nice to say that the anomalous feel is that part 0 Ferrari diameter is made 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340
 Right 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.020
 Well, the sound of around 5,000 rotations and 6000 rotations 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.250
 If you're listening inside, what 's good about it ? 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.730
 If it sounds good outside as well, it just sounds like this inside 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.610
 Outside too 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.659

 Even if the owner told me to register the old-style phone number 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.880
 Well that's why I'm being scolded 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.069
 After all, I have never got a Maserati 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.520
