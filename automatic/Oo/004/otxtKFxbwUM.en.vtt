it's going to spread because why the
burner<00:01:46.860> has<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.250> travel<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.810> first<00:01:49.079> I've

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
burner has to travel so the first I've

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
burner has to travel so the first I've
ever<00:01:49.500> seen<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.130> high<00:01:50.939> school<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.360> they

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
ever seen is like high school if they

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
ever seen is like high school if they
across<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> map<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> they're<00:01:52.409> running<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
across the map and they're running it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.859 
across the map and they're running it
becomes<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.700> 1<00:01:53.939> 2<00:01:54.060> 3<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.329> mean<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> gotta

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
becomes like 1 2 3 I mean you gotta

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
when they're running away from you if

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.569 
when they're running away from you if
they're<00:02:02.969> behind<00:02:03.360> cover<00:02:03.780> guys<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.460> promise<00:02:05.460> you

they're behind cover guys I promise you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.950 
they're behind cover guys I promise you
if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> guess<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.420> they're<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.630> pop<00:02:06.930> up

if you guess when they're gonna pop up

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
if you guess when they're gonna pop up
right<00:02:07.649> away<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.580> don't<00:02:08.700> even<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.879> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
right away and you don't even have to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.430 
right away and you don't even have to
guess<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.509> could<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.810> shoot<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.200> reload

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
guess you could just shoot and reload

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.260 
guess you could just shoot and reload
again<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> basically<00:02:11.879> drove<00:02:12.450> back<00:02:12.660> so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
again because it basically drove back so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.090 
again because it basically drove back so

one count as a body shot that's because

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.770 
one count as a body shot that's because
the<00:02:26.200> bone<00:02:26.410> arrow<00:02:26.620> curves<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:28.390> know<00:02:28.540> it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the bone arrow curves so you know it's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.750 
the bone arrow curves so you know it's
it's<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.140> guy's<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.560> gots<00:02:29.740> an<00:02:29.890> advantage<00:02:30.310> even

/ 50 to 75 percent damage / it really
doesn't<00:02:44.680> vary<00:02:44.920> but<00:02:45.100> I've<00:02:45.220> seen<00:02:45.460> times<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.790> got

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
doesn't vary but I've seen times I got

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.700 
doesn't vary but I've seen times I got
shot<00:02:46.150> with<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.270> bow<00:02:46.540> I'm<00:02:46.840> within<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.530> bow<00:02:47.680> and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
it's kind of different it's crazy i've

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.710 
it's kind of different it's crazy i've
seen<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.770> happen<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.220> few<00:03:21.250> times<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:22.450> if<00:03:22.630> you

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
seen it happen a few times but if you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.790 
seen it happen a few times but if you
don't<00:03:22.870> want<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.050> go<00:03:23.140> farther<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.650> you're

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
don't want to go farther and you're

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.500 
don't want to go farther and you're
really<00:03:24.130> accurate<00:03:24.580> always<00:03:24.970> should<00:03:25.150> at<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
really accurate always should at the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.850 
really accurate always should at the
legs<00:03:25.750> since<00:03:26.110> they<00:03:26.200> don't<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.380> armor<00:03:26.709> down

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
legs since they don't have armor down

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.199 
legs since they don't have armor down
there<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.400> can<00:03:27.580> still<00:03:27.760> take<00:03:27.910> them<00:03:28.030> down<00:03:28.180> to

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
there you can still take them down to

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.350 
there you can still take them down to
two<00:03:28.480> shots<00:03:28.720> instead<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.620> three<00:03:29.980> shots<00:03:30.250> okay<00:03:30.760> so

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
two shots instead of three shots okay so

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.449 
two shots instead of three shots okay so
