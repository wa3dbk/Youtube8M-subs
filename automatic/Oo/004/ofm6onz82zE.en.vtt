00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.839
 Alex and I continue to travel on 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.030
 skyrim and doing reviews on skyrim mods 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.340
 maybe some of you will ask 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.400
 Alex Where are you so fucking 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.049
 swords and I certainly will answer I installed 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 a small mod that contributes 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.840
 the variety of weapons in the game adds to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.380
 the game is new types of other weapons 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.330
 ebony weapons and some other 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 an incomprehensible type of weapon in general 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 crafted from gems but I don't 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.739
 began to do them because well, somehow this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:41.570
 expensive here such a weapon from 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.040
 gems for example for example 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.040
 Now I'll try to find 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.470
 Well, for example from emeralds that is 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.570
 such weapon 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.750
 strange though he has enough 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.870
 little damage I did not do it 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.000
 expensive 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.760
 but steel weapons are very, very 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.970
 much and with such a solid enough 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.320
 the damage that I did, of course, I did 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:15.610
 Here is a sword and what else in my opinion 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.710
 my and this 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 swords look very cool very cheap 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.940
 Kraft so fly with you yes again 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.970
 zabagovannuyu its poor thing but here 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.220
 crafting is very simple from basically 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.600
 steel ingots strips of leather 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.280
 somewhere silver somewhere gold in general 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.920
 interesting but here it is generally from 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.330
 dragon scales crafting ie 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.410
 various weapons with good damage and 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.890
 just awesome view i am very happy 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.670
 long ago I was looking for something similar because 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.340
 basically all things sev on weapons they 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.920
 look like it's pathetic all swords 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.140
 either some huge wide not 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.080
 beautiful pathos or a thread common 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 shit, but this is such a light 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.289
 and at the same time quite epic and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.180
 also added its not your weapon in 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 Mostly these are katanas 3 rods 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.620
 different sizes are added 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.150
 two-handed one-handed damage well this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.910
 understandably among different 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.099
 You can also find good swords that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.709
 look fairly normal in principle 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.629
 for skyrim it's very very good 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.390
 because basically all swords are they either 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.870
 some too pretentious such as 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.660
 the same elven to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.900
 or some too ugly as 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.590
 iron well, that is something like this 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.019
 just not enough in the game 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.540
 let's wash it up like this 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:57.319
 ordinary steel sword they like him 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.159
 looks really also a lot here 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.709
 interesting 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.739
 if you install this mod i think you 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.849
 find a sword that you personally like 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.769
 I have already found a couple for myself and am running 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.569
 principle satisfied and satisfied not only 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:17.200
 view but also the damage that infuses it 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.049
 this gear ie 2216 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:26.389
 I think it's not bad because 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:29.000
 same sunrise dawn here 18 this is your 22 here 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:33.019
 so here and again he reminds me of a sword from 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.870
 so from the lord of the rings to the elven 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.980
 the sword is a divinely simply awesome sword 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.079
 of course I link to this mod 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.409
 I will provide in the description of the video and if 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.720
 you liked the video liked the mod itself 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.329
 then install mod put huskies under 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.269
 video but in principle this is all with you 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.720
 I was Alex for new meetings bye bye 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.720
 until
