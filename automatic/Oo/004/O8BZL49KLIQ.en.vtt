00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 hello my dear yes I have to confess 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 I was a bit lazy today mobbing 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 I have concerns not the camera 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.680
 taken everywhere and today is too 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320
 not too much exciting happened 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 what am I doing right now? 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 evening I have seen or has me 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 already from the week notes that today 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 again unit documentary drankommt 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.610
 I have seen him before this is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.470
 just awesome there will be easy too 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.329
 shown that the hai is not a beast 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.550
 but that he even with humans 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.370
 plays that you let go with it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.470
 well knows from the white hai also the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.450
 always shown as a monster and 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.190
 I'm such a crazy here can 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.880
 you also see it again as you see 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 a picture like mark ii was taken from the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.160
 I also let white hai pull 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 already with a few documentary films 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.660
 contact the touch with home 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 I hope I have gone 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.630
 someday also this luck will have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.420
 and at some point a video from me too 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 See where I get from a hai 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 white shark or tiger shark 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.740
 i will just like the people 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 Show that the hype just ours 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 Help needs 100 to 200 million sharks 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 are killed each year 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 fishing by shark finning there 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 only the fins cut off and the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.060
 the rest of the healing becomes alive again 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.909
 Water really throws the cribs 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 the miserable fat and the stifling I 've got 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.510
 in English course I had the beginning of the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.580
 year or in the spring I had one 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.810
 English course made voluntarily because I 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.650
 just refresh my English again 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 wanted 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.510
 and there I had a talk about 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.270
 or yes referat you can say yes 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.460
 Made everywhere and over shark finning 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 yes, and many people know that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.580
 not that they are equally threatened and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 that the really adorable animals 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.500
 these are the attacks, for example 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.409
 but these frequent users stand 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.900
 came because this stole the sharks 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.640
 aggressive the vibrations made the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.459
 thereby be generated in the water yet 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.079
 this salt can feel the sharks and thereby 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.870
 then they have always against this 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.879
 cage grid bitten 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.610
 but as soon as you get this material 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.980
 has exchanged against aluminum belief 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.650
 I am that does not happen now 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.150
 more so the sharks are interested 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.489
 no longer for this yeast because 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.720
 no vibrations are emitted 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.030
 but I'm looking forward to any event 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 very much on the documentation even if I 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.269
 you've seen it before i find it 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.569
 Such people are so great the easy 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.090
 want to show that the hai or too 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.829
 other animals depicted as beasts 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.920
 but are lovable business meals 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.430
 and that we also learn a lot from them 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.470
 At some point there will be no more 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.120
 if we continue like that and then 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.340
 the whole system gives the whole 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.370
 ecosystem in the water is granted tilt 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.590
 because that means for this balance 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.180
 is also responsible and I think that 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.420
 most of them do not realize that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.579
 Keep that simple 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.709
 chain reaction is that many things are broken 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 It's just going to happen today 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.430
 only to the profit I mean this 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.919
 These shark fins flowed, for example 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.130
 sold in the Asian market because 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.400
 because soups are produced with it or 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.019
 also any asian 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.569
 medicines but that ultimately in 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.190
 These fins are also contained in the fabric 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.930
 are toxic to humans 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 that does not interest them so yes 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.000
 I do not even want more say 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.870
 because otherwise i will be here somehow 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.519
 abusive and I want to avoid 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.290
 I also have an Asian 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.419
 friend you should definitely 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.239
 Bear in mind that the hot very important 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.069
 you should start protecting him 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.069
 then I'll just do one today 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.889
 nice relaxed evening and tomorrow is 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.579
 then the camera again with everywhere 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.720
 At the same time, the sharks and how they protect that 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.720
 tomorrow again
