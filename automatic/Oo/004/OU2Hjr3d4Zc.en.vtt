 go away karem decline in employment whether such a measure and active and with few 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.089
 the rules of use 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.880
 from the depression like the current one the balls to a goal of left-handed 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.759
 photo ap 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.459
 About six years ago a friend of mine gave me a picture 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.820
 And that's where the name inspired by this painting comes from: a woman who is a girl 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.010
 my ring we knew but we do know because historicist and sidÃ³n then like 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.740
 also a story that we have created for those who are elected 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.890
 well, 100 years we have played little 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.120
 but in reality it's also that we really like the study process 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.700
 and here the truth and that the internet is like ours 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.850
 oo 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.620
 implement this month the number one what not necessarily by not touching on 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.360
 live, people are not going to listen to us 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.790
 then if the name has sounded or two hundred to try to sentence this 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.000
 music has been percent of the contest corn I think she 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.870
 somehow we need in two acts very little experience with life 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.080
 then also the fact that we do not speak little has to do with some 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.740
 way 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.869
 I imagine that with the limitations that we have as a band to do it 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.270
 even better possible to help stop where we want to be 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.700
 resonated sonar like the presence 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 exhorted to have as fewer fears do not stop approaching with the public 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.630
 so far I think that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.230
 since we developed this project almost three years ago right next door 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.180
 the relationship with 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 entirely another 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 mmmmm 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.540
 if they take before the presentation of the disc was just now in more 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.610
 in this first disc stop material you call 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.610
 already almost nobody all for three years 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:15.069
 then in that time that the Master and Sami discs are established 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.430
 it was already finished 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.309
 we are also accompanied to the discretion set lima 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.459
 the very productive stage 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.360
 el girona elche sonia is still they are usually operators a little 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.179
 more danceable or more sold 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:34.569
 with respect to the live show also a little bit the search for this moment 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.420
 where it has to do with 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.880
 what we feel the first time on the scene to hell if the first 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.949
 disco that we are much calmer because people feel listen to it 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.060
 suddenly I do not think we needed certainty like 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.029
 relationship a little more 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.999
 from where the viewer studied with more joy not to speak in any way 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.029
 the rose then gave a little bit what we have worked on this new album 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.259
 they go hand in hand too 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.259
 with that moment it will begin to flow with a little more 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.309
 Kirchner 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.309
 well I think there is something very personal in my house 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.539
 it's what melody has to do with it 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:17.749
 at the moment there is a point in the song when the melody the lyrics and 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:21.909
 the music come together and exploits he chose them I admit it for example eating 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.259
 Physically it produces magical things so there is no element schenkel nothing clear 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:31.289
 well obviously, it's recipes for making songs because in the end they're going to 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.329
 be exact 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.669
 they are just a good song I do not think 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.399
 in the sequences 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.399
 in a week what I think it does nourish her 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.409
 France 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.150
 for marin us the sport 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.959
 this morning the directive of tigers of detroit to the effective norm champion of the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.759
 carnival min 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.799
 there has been health through twitter not every year the lnd 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:01.959
