what<00:00:31.850> I<00:00:31.880> do<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.390> fold<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:32.960> shirt<00:00:33.200> in<00:00:33.350> half<00:00:33.820> take

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
what I do is fold the shirt in half take

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.090 
what I do is fold the shirt in half take
the<00:00:35.000> shoulder<00:00:35.420> seams<00:00:36.019> one<00:00:36.530> here<00:00:36.859> and<00:00:36.949> one<00:00:37.070> here

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
the shoulder seams one here and one here

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.049 
the shoulder seams one here and one here
line<00:00:37.789> them<00:00:37.999> up<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:38.449> then<00:00:39.609> just<00:00:40.609> make<00:00:40.850> that

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
line them up and then just make that

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.099 
line them up and then just make that
sure<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:41.749> is<00:00:41.960> folded<00:00:42.350> exactly<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.010> half

want it to be too low in the back or

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.929 
want it to be too low in the back or
you'll<00:01:57.530> find<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.130> falling<00:01:58.789> off<00:01:58.909> your

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.020 
you'll find that it's falling off your
shoulders<00:01:59.710> if<00:02:00.710> that's<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.070> look<00:02:01.249> you<00:02:01.399> want<00:02:01.640> then

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
shoulders if that's a look you want then

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.819 
shoulders if that's a look you want then
definitely<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:02.899> can<00:02:03.079> cut<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.409> back<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.710> it

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
definitely you can cut the back of it

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.249 
definitely you can cut the back of it
lower<00:02:03.999> so<00:02:04.999> that's<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.359> part<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.689> cut<00:02:05.869> off<00:02:06.020> you

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
lower so that's the part you cut off you

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.040 
lower so that's the part you cut off you
can<00:02:06.409> take<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.740> away

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.610 

and<00:02:09.140> now<00:02:10.540> you<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:11.810> scoop-neck<00:02:12.140> shirt
