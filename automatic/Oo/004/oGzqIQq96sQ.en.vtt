00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
the people don't even hit the protein

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.900 
the people don't even hit the protein
ratio<00:03:46.019> then<00:03:46.349> they<00:03:46.440> asked<00:03:46.590> me<00:03:46.739> what<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> fuckin<00:03:47.760> i

ratio then they asked me what a fuckin i

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.439 
ratio then they asked me what a fuckin i
gaining<00:03:48.180> muscle<00:03:49.669> hit<00:03:50.669> that<00:03:50.819> fucking<00:03:51.150> protein

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
gaining muscle hit that fucking protein

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.270 
gaining muscle hit that fucking protein
racing<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:51.959> get<00:03:52.230> some<00:03:52.379> way<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.980> gonna<00:03:53.069> save

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
racing so get some way it's gonna save

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.189 
racing so get some way it's gonna save
your<00:03:53.430> money<00:03:53.639> you're<00:03:54.569> gonna<00:03:54.690> get<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.989> protein

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
your money you're gonna get that protein

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.199 
your money you're gonna get that protein
and<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.889> it<00:03:56.400> should<00:03:56.819> be<00:03:56.849> your<00:03:57.030> top<00:03:57.180> priority

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
and so it should be your top priority

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.330 
and so it should be your top priority
