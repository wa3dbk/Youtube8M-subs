00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and I do have the steady shot active

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.630 
and I do have the steady shot active
steady<00:00:20.670> shot<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.650> which<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.130> balanced

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
steady shot on which is that balanced

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
steady shot on which is that balanced
optical<00:00:24.240> steadyshot<00:00:24.449> they<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> active

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
optical steadyshot they have a active

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.370 
optical steadyshot they have a active
setting<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> setting<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
setting I have it on that setting you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.870 
setting I have it on that setting you
can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> these<00:00:29.160> shots<00:00:29.429> are<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> little

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
can see some of these shots are a little

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
can see some of these shots are a little
bit<00:00:30.090> jittery<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.560> trying<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> hold<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
bit jittery and I was trying to hold it

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.000 
bit jittery and I was trying to hold it
as<00:00:32.399> steady<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.910> could<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.690> while<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.590> works

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
as steady as I could so while that works

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
as steady as I could so while that works
a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> time<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.770> perfect<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a lot of the time it's not perfect you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
a lot of the time it's not perfect you
can<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> moving

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
can see this one here kind of moving

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
can see this one here kind of moving
around<00:00:39.450> here's<00:00:39.750> where<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.960> had<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.200> zoomed<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
around here's where I had it zoomed in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.819 
around here's where I had it zoomed in
on<00:00:41.100> these<00:00:41.460> folks<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.320> again<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> didn't<00:00:43.680> add

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
on these folks and again I didn't add

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
on these folks and again I didn't add

color<00:00:48.629> correction<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:50.280> just

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
color correction at all this is all just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
color correction at all this is all just
straight<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> camera<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> did

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
straight out of the camera but I did

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
straight out of the camera but I did
have<00:00:52.980> someone<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.030> commented<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> my

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
have someone that commented on one of my

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.180 
have someone that commented on one of my
other<00:00:54.989> videos<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.469> wanted<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:55.980> some

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
other videos I wanted to see some

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
other videos I wanted to see some
nighttime<00:00:56.430> shots<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.660> how<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> handles

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
nighttime shots to see how it handles

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.340 
nighttime shots to see how it handles
artificial<00:00:58.980> lights<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.430> night<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> just

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
artificial lights at night and so I just

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
artificial lights at night and so I just
walked<00:01:01.590> around<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.010> resort<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
walked around the resort here and just

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.640 
walked around the resort here and just
shot<00:01:03.629> these<00:01:03.930> clips<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:07.020> okay

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
shot these clips and it's okay

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
shot these clips and it's okay
it's<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.340> again<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> relatively

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's it's again this is a relatively

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's it's again this is a relatively
small<00:01:10.020> sensor<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> camera<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:11.939> not

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
small sensor in this camera so it's not

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450 
small sensor in this camera so it's not
going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.350> super<00:01:13.860> low-light

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
going to be I think a super low-light

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.109 
going to be I think a super low-light
performer<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.530> pinch<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.400> not

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
performer but in a pinch it's not not

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.810 
performer but in a pinch it's not not
bad<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.290> ask<00:01:19.439> me<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> none<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> these

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bad if you ask me and none of these

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
bad if you ask me and none of these
areas<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.170> call<00:01:22.290> super

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
areas are what I would call super

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
areas are what I would call super
well-lit<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.030> relatively<00:01:24.630> low<00:01:24.990> light

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
well-lit the relatively low light

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.910 
well-lit the relatively low light
artificial<00:01:25.830> light<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.619> area

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
artificial light not you know this area

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.289 
artificial light not you know this area
here<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.610> brighter<00:01:29.820> than<00:01:30.119> some

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
here was a little bit brighter than some

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.109 
here was a little bit brighter than some
of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> others<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.290> decent<00:01:32.250> lights<00:01:32.729> but

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
of the others but a decent lights but

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.560 
of the others but a decent lights but
not<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> would<00:01:34.409> call<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.360> lit

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
not not what you would call you know lit

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.429 
not not what you would call you know lit
up<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.720> daytime<00:01:37.320> by<00:01:37.560> any<00:01:37.740> means<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.229> is

giving you a pretty good this here was

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
giving you a pretty good this here was
relatively<00:01:43.860> dark<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> whole<00:01:44.939> lot<00:01:45.090> of

relatively dark here not a whole lot of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
relatively dark here not a whole lot of
