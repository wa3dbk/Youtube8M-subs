00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 in this game everywhere and I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 I bring the first first first close 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 gameplay first gameplay and first 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.230
 game that I've played in critics that I've 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
 seen that I think this leads to the chorus 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.600
 from you this game is not so bad nor is it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.430
 badly eh has been returned because my 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 team was painful because good now what 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.650
 you are going to see is that it is very fun to see 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.010
 graphically appeared a bait and a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.559
 onion without peeling an ugly onion is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.329
 here I was testing if it was r1 r2 with 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 the one that shoots but I think I've already 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.690
 shot a blinding to get to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 my companions luck that there is no fire 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 good friends I have started strong start 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 strong running tight trying the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.199
 buttons and over here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.920
 so once you get pretty poor, 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.899
 graphically 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 I think worse than white 2 there 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.140
 he has a grenade that does nothing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.449
 because there is precisely an uncle who 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.980
 Take that briefcase and go and now look 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.890
 in this I'm going to look out I'm going to add the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 halter I'm going to say 1 2 and 3 I'm going for 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.430
 there the time dies 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 there he was as good as dead from a 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 style to die, what about dying so much 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.829
 you're taking the roll you're not taking the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 roll and I'm wrong this game you go to 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.220
 see as common at times 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.540
 it looks like I do it well and that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 this weapon that I carry, I think it's 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 flattened or something because now you see how 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.330
 I start to shoot that I already do a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.860
 little bit with the controls this does not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.799
 You can ride you can not not ride it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.149
 let's go going on get a grenade that's 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.950
 that there is one around here that does not mean that 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.229
 I shot this and straight that is a hit 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.549
 go a hit marker ago hit marker but 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.189
 I do not see it because it 's one I was very 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.140
 nervous I go around here and I do 1 2 and 3 and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.030
 love and again that is very old direct 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.649
 as soon as I see that you do not worry because 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.690
 I'm going to come up at some point 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.819
 given I always think that bazooka arrived 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.979
 to end the eu but no but not 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.200
 I do not know if at any time I can 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.049
 improve in this game I can improve 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.539
 if in fact it can improve if I want 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.950
 improve I do not know I'll play from time to time 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.270
 to a game to have a laugh with 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.220
 some colleagues and such but what is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.259
 play forever to sleep my son in all 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.000
 the forehead in me to my friend that mind 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 good on the whole front 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.330
 the point is that I want to play more this 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.360
 with my friends or with my colleagues to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.569
 laugh but not for good 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.310
 the first low as surcharge here 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.439
 on this side I climb here down the hillside 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.540
 the hillside and I say I say a two and 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.269
 three I turn and you see a dose smells 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.470
 a 2-2 streak just no no no because 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.110
 now comes this and a dose three 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.760
 also ranch three and had a sad one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.440
 sad but as I do not know or well I do not know 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.220
 I have thrown and there you can see how 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.060
 the wow stays there this game in 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.370
 that hole 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.019
 in that that never then never ever 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.609
 he got to throw that he had helped me 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.230
 the game yes probably to kill 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.480
 some more but good with the bad that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.129
 I'm pretty much done with killing 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.049
 those three well a streak of three like that 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.730
 fantastic and now you are going to see how 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.590
 wobble to this part to them that I 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.000
 I saw it is cool what is the first 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.470
 tonic is the first I think that because 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.359
 the sister concentrated more than me 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.069
 this rest as you see I do not know the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.209
 flash the flashback neste that I found out 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.680
 by the provencio I have no idea 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.170
 but good as you see graphically 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.129
 it is neither one nor the other 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 world 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.780
 nothing of another world and nothing of 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.670
 this because really I do tell you the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.019
 right now I believe that this 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.670
 they have taken a little bit to fill in 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.379
 there I die again because there was one and 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.470
 campeando campeando but as here not 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.510
 there is cinema mode 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.040
 because at least I have not known 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.420
 find and people were already 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.100
 commenting that there is no cinema mode so 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.020
 well I will not do I will not be able to 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.640
 make montages as my illusion done 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.080
 another death, apart from me they give me 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.630
 spoilers do not want I like it very much 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.610
 when it rains and it 's there 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.260
 well look east this is here 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.300
 I got almost put the grenade to myself 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.730
 I go up here on the mountain and I make a 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.820
 of Tom's strategy is already tense with 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.200
 the neck has a sac but I'm dying 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.510
 instantaneously for entertaining me and for 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.450
 not being a clever uncle what he wants 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.400
 to say is that this game is favorable 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.140
 for me I have had luck with some 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.300
 in some moments here and here 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.580
 I have a party pooper there again 350 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.010
 rise of rank olé olé olé what good what 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.570
 Well, the game is pretty 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.220
 favorable for me and I could have done 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.120
 much more in this game than I have 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.650
 actually done but I'm not saying 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.209
 pro ni competitive player aquino and 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.360
 behind this one but they 're going to kill me in 3 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.560
 there it is and I do not know how to compete player and 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.150
 much less but yes it is true that a 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.650
 game to have fun and when I get to 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.090
 playing with competido and players is a 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.800
 I really love and I am rajasthan 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.490
 119 things so they are very very much 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.620
 beautiful 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.389
 super good in the east but you are going to see 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.410
 how in these neither so bad nor to this as 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.319
 I take it from afar 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.660
 olé olé and olé if there is sometimes 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.759
 times when one of these females is 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.680
 shadow here here almost killed him almost almost 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.750
 but the tree makes me the tree 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.759
 through that it seems that the roof trees 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.740
 of crystal for good god's sake no 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.050
 is much as you see on the right put 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.940
 the this in the classification and I'm going 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.220
 First of all they fixed that shit 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.120
 team I have to take to go first 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.979
 because that's why I do not know that deaths and 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.389
 assistance an assistance be I carry 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.759
 fewer assists than shaquille o'neal 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.919
 so there you have it to really not 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.020
 it does not happen much more, he will die again 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.000
 how many times but the truth of this of 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.409
 this game is that minor I have 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.440
 found I did not find it so bad we 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.630
 have seen that people are good kill me 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.610
 the weapon you know the kill the weapon is not that 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.800
 say so because also when they would be 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.970
 very bad people as you see all of my 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.560
 team mostly have a range 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.750
 Mierdoso del palo one is 135 and already 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.599
 is and I am the one who has 2 and well there 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.409
 goes first so you really have not 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.259
 been for both him 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.029
 so bad the game but good has its 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.279
 little things have killed another killed another very 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:40.399
 well and have the eye eye eye that I 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.629
 I come up right away because they kill me 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.629
 in others 

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:48.469
 but there I am, you see, this is my friend of mine 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.369
 mine how it hooks me here on the hillside 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.580
 I'm going 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:54.769
 stork pum to sleep that's me I duck 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.899
 because I was already feeling it was 

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:58.669
 feeling that they were going to kill me and said 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:01.219
 this here I make mine mine mine as 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.449
 the bait like sponge like sponge but 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.979
 at the end attendance 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.229
 I want to throw and one comes from behind and 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:11.300
 fumigates us both but today in 9 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.019
 killed 9 casualties 12 deaths is not so 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.289
 wrong 

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:16.279
 - 13 deaths now is not bad for 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.199
 make the first game and especially 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.729
 for serious and you know that one that has 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.039
 a way to be very good with the 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.919
 jealousy do not come all in troops to 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.469
 tell me how is not that is not a 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.849
 employment to have a laugh is not a 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.349
 example to have a laugh for 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.939
 listen to me comment as a subnormal 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.110
 deep because really what is 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.599
 playing credit I have no fucking idea 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.210
 mine as a brand and now what happens now 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:42.560
 well over here on the right 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:45.050
 behind the dog to take the first one 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.730
 dogs like but my relationship with 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.470
 the dogs lately has not been very 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.210
 good because I keep dying 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.530
 and I do not know why I seem to do the 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.810
 backing and I think a guy from behind 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.790
 I do not even know what the fuck is going on 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.380
 I do not know what's going to happen but I'm still 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.360
 go ahead with my life and this blog charge 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.580
 fast I do not charge the dog that 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.860
 interposes in the trajectory of that 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.660
