00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
screw Boleyn not completely finger died

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.320 
screw Boleyn not completely finger died
you<00:02:39.450> will<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.320> will<00:02:40.470> feel<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:41.220> will<00:02:42.260> touch<00:02:44.330> to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
you will you will feel it will touch to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.310 
you will you will feel it will touch to
check<00:02:45.570> if<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> right<00:02:46.830> position

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
check if it's in the right position

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.430 
check if it's in the right position
because<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:50.130> tool<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:52.080> campus

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
because the tool is really the campus

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.280 
because the tool is really the campus
really<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.480> mushy<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.130> a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
really and not mushy I can have it in a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.750 
really and not mushy I can have it in a
piece<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.920> still<00:02:59.220> rotate<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
piece and I can still rotate the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.900 
piece and I can still rotate the
crankshaft<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.570> little<00:03:00.840> bit<00:03:01.490> in<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.760> right
