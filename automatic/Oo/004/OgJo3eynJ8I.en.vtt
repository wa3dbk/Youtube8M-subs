00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I'm sure there's quite a few in here

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
I'm sure there's quite a few in here
that<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.140> could<00:00:58.350> find<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:59.190> anyway<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.609> just

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that I could find but anyway it's just

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
that I could find but anyway it's just
important<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> find<00:01:00.960> ones<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> don't

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
important to find ones that you don't

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.820 
important to find ones that you don't
need<00:01:02.480> just<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.110> save<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.500> battery

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
need just so you can save more battery

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
need just so you can save more battery
life<00:01:04.860> also<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.090> privacy<00:01:06.659> tab

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
life also if you go to the privacy tab

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
life also if you go to the privacy tab
order<00:01:07.770> location<00:01:08.340> services<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.060> also

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
order location services I would also

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
order location services I would also
recommend<00:01:09.420> finding<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.890> apps<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.729> your

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
recommend finding the apps that use your

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
recommend finding the apps that use your
location<00:01:12.510> often<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> actually

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
location often and see if you actually

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
location often and see if you actually
need<00:01:14.250> them<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.729> enabled<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.840> instance<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
need them to be enabled for instance I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
need them to be enabled for instance I
could<00:01:16.470> turn<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:16.830> fancy<00:01:17.280> hands<00:01:17.900> some<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> these

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
could turn off fancy hands some of these

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
could turn off fancy hands some of these
I<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.189> location<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> be

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I would actually like the location to be

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
I would actually like the location to be
enabled<00:01:21.210> some<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.080> doesn't<00:01:22.409> really

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
enabled some of them it doesn't really

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
enabled some of them it doesn't really
matter<00:01:23.130> also<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.909> scroll<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
matter also if you scroll down all the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.420 
matter also if you scroll down all the
way<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> bottom<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
way here to the bottom there is this

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.300 
way here to the bottom there is this
system<00:01:27.150> services<00:01:27.960> tab<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.710> click<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you can turn off things like

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230 
you can turn off things like
location-based<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.710> ads<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.030> need

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
location-based I ads I don't really need

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
location-based I ads I don't really need
them<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.750> using<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.860> data<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.670> can

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
them to be using up my data so they can

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
them to be using up my data so they can
just<00:01:36.030> give<00:01:36.180> me<00:01:36.360> better<00:01:36.540> advertisements

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
just give me better advertisements

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.140

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.109 
that's that is not what I'm about
however<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.979> better<00:01:41.100> traffic<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
however if I get better traffic if I
