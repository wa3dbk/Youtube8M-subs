card I'm going to tell you what's good

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
card I'm going to tell you what's good
about<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> what's<00:00:16.590> bad<00:00:16.770> about<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.760> bad

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
about it and what's bad about it the bad

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820 
about it and what's bad about it the bad
thing<00:00:18.210> about<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.470> overclock

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
thing about it is that if you overclock

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.580 
thing about it is that if you overclock
it<00:00:19.949> too<00:00:20.250> much<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:22.350> high

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it too much you can get really high

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.439 
it too much you can get really high
temperatures<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.400> short<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> life<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.300> your

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
temperatures in short the life of your

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.000 
temperatures in short the life of your
graphics<00:00:24.840> card<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:27.320> that<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:28.800> bad

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
graphics card and that can be really bad

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.669 
graphics card and that can be really bad
for<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.429> course<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.599> good<00:00:30.810> thing<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.260> if

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
for of course the good thing is that if

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.830 
for of course the good thing is that if
you're<00:00:31.859> smart<00:00:32.219> about<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.329> overclock

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you're smart about it and you overclock

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.540 
you're smart about it and you overclock
a<00:00:33.870> little<00:00:34.320> by<00:00:34.410> little<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> find<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
a little by little and you find the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.900 
a little by little and you find the
right<00:00:35.989> overclocked<00:00:36.989> amount<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:40.910> gigahertz

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
right overclocked amount of of gigahertz

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
right overclocked amount of of gigahertz
the<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.480> overclock<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:43.379> you'll<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.890> set

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the you overclock it then you'll be set

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.240 
the you overclock it then you'll be set
you<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> better<00:00:45.840> performance<00:00:46.250> you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you it will get a better performance you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
you it will get a better performance you
won't<00:00:47.430> even<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.969> upgrade<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> newer

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
won't even have to upgrade to a newer

take the bottom like ten seconds to open

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.560 
take the bottom like ten seconds to open
so<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.790> patient

all<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.440> there<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.330> now

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
all right there we go now

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.300 
all right there we go now
you<00:01:37.790> use<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.300> basic<00:01:38.810> layout<00:01:39.070> it's<00:01:40.070> going<00:01:40.250> to

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you use the basic layout it's going to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.770 
you use the basic layout it's going to
show<00:01:40.430> you<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:40.700> graphics<00:01:41.060> are<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.330> have<00:01:41.540> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
show you what graphics are you have and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.550 
show you what graphics are you have and
I<00:01:42.740> don't<00:01:42.920> know<00:01:43.010> why<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.840> doesn't<00:01:45.260> show<00:01:45.380> my

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
I don't know why but it doesn't show my

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.550 
I don't know why but it doesn't show my
tribal<00:01:45.830> version<00:01:46.280> because<00:01:46.610> they<00:01:47.390> are<00:01:47.660> beta<00:01:47.990> so

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
tribal version because they are beta so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.130 
tribal version because they are beta so
maybe<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.280> yours<00:01:49.520> hopefully<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:50.060> will<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.110> I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
maybe in yours hopefully it will but I

too hot your graphics card is getting
too<00:02:24.290> hot<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.070> might<00:02:25.340> want<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.910> increase<00:02:26.150> the

too hot you might want to increase the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.050 
too hot you might want to increase the
speed<00:02:26.480> fan<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.590> since<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.100> don't<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.550> can't<00:02:28.940> do

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
speed fan but since I don't I can't do

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.490 
speed fan but since I don't I can't do
it<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> flap<00:02:29.810> top<00:02:30.050> we're<00:02:30.350> not

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it because of the flap top we're not

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.800 
it because of the flap top we're not
even<00:02:30.650> gonna<00:02:30.770> touch<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.420> safe<00:02:32.630> way<00:02:32.780> to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
even gonna touch it and the safe way to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.630 
even gonna touch it and the safe way to
do<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.440> just<00:02:33.470> overclock<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> little<00:02:34.520> by

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
do this is just overclock a little by

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.240 
do this is just overclock a little by
little<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.300> Ron<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.110> first<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.830> need<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.100> run

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
little so Ron you first you need to run

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.520 
little so Ron you first you need to run
your<00:02:37.459> game<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.720> write<00:02:38.959> down<00:02:38.989> how<00:02:39.320> many

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530

like a hundred or something and then
just<00:02:53.480> apply<00:02:53.660> it

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
just apply it

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.130 
just apply it

and forth back and forth and let's say

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.479 
and forth back and forth and let's say
that<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.640> overclock<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.269> way<00:03:17.450> too<00:03:17.510> much<00:03:17.840> and

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
that you overclock it way too much and

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.100 
that you overclock it way too much and
you're<00:03:19.489> gonna<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.030> probably<00:03:20.720> got<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.900> blue

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
you're gonna you probably got a blue

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.370 
you're gonna you probably got a blue
screen<00:03:21.380> or<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:23.209> graphics<00:03:23.690> arts<00:03:23.900> burning

screen or you you graphics arts burning

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.080 
screen or you you graphics arts burning
right<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:24.739> at<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.070> point<00:03:25.340> it's<00:03:25.700> getting

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
right now at this point it's getting

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.990 
right now at this point it's getting
really<00:03:26.450> hot<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.310> you're<00:03:28.310> scared<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.700> minute

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
really hot and you're scared the minute

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.200 
really hot and you're scared the minute
do<00:03:29.120> something<00:03:29.450> bad<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.200> just

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
do something bad to it so just

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.690 
do something bad to it so just
to<00:03:32.960> 1/16<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:33.680> its<00:03:34.250> go<00:03:34.700> back<00:03:35.080> try<00:03:36.080> like<00:03:36.470> 15<00:03:37.310> less

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
to 1/16 is its go back try like 15 less

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.930 
to 1/16 is its go back try like 15 less
or<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.480> hundred<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.920> whatnot<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.670> I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
or like a hundred and whatnot and I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.790 
or like a hundred and whatnot and I
should<00:03:41.120> fix<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.450> problem<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:42.380> let's<00:03:42.650> say

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
should fix the problem and let's say

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.710 
should fix the problem and let's say
that<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.220> did<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.640> perfect<00:03:43.910> overclocking

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
that you did the perfect overclocking

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.540 
that you did the perfect overclocking
and<00:03:44.840> you're<00:03:45.080> getting<00:03:45.260> about<00:03:45.710> 10<00:03:46.010> frames<00:03:46.280> per

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
and you're getting about 10 frames per

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.180 
and you're getting about 10 frames per
second<00:03:46.910> more<00:03:47.270> in<00:03:47.450> your<00:03:47.600> game<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:49.160> have

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
second more in your game and you have

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.090 
second more in your game and you have
the<00:03:50.180> temperature<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.930> not<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.470> hot<00:03:51.710> so<00:03:52.040> you

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
the temperature it's not that hot so you

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.790 
the temperature it's not that hot so you
can<00:03:52.370> actually<00:03:52.880> deal<00:03:53.090> with<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.480> it's<00:03:53.900> about<00:03:54.200> 70

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
can actually deal with it it's about 70

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.540 
can actually deal with it it's about 70
or<00:03:54.980> 80<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.390> it's<00:03:56.570> actually<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.860> hot<00:03:58.100> but

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
or 80 so it's actually not that hot but

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.640 
or 80 so it's actually not that hot but
still<00:03:58.760> hot<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.360> you<00:04:00.260> only<00:04:00.410> going<00:04:00.590> to

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
still hot and you only going to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.800 
still hot and you only going to
overclock<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.250> when<00:04:01.430> you're<00:04:01.580> gaming<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.330> you

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
overclock you when you're gaming and you

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.600 
overclock you when you're gaming and you

want to save those settings for the next

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.850 
want to save those settings for the next
time<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.030> install<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.110> restart

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
time that you install that you restart

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
your computer and want to play a game

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.300 
your computer and want to play a game
and<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.840> way<00:04:08.960> to<00:04:09.020> do<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.410> is<00:04:09.590> you're<00:04:10.190> gonna

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and the way to do that is you're gonna

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.970 
and the way to do that is you're gonna
save<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:12.170> you're<00:04:12.380> gonna<00:04:12.470> save<00:04:12.740> it<00:04:12.860> into

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
save it and you're gonna save it into

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.590 
save it and you're gonna save it into
any<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.120> have<00:04:14.150> five<00:04:14.420> different

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
any of this so you have five different

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.800 
any of this so you have five different
profiles<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.290> let's<00:04:15.470> do<00:04:15.830> number<00:04:15.950> one<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:17.660> I

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
profiles so let's do number one and I

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.229 
profiles so let's do number one and I
would<00:04:17.989> say<00:04:18.280> now<00:04:19.280> let's<00:04:19.520> say<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.820> restarted

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
would say now let's say that I restarted

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.940 
would say now let's say that I restarted
my<00:04:20.300> computer<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:21.170> I<00:04:21.260> want<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.500> play<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.680> game

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
my computer and I want to play a game

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.910 
my computer and I want to play a game
but<00:04:22.670> I<00:04:22.940> want<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.270> overclock<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.710> same

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
but I want to overclock it to the same

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.650 
but I want to overclock it to the same
frequency<00:04:25.370> that<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.580> have<00:04:25.820> before<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:26.390> I<00:04:26.420> don't

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
frequency that I have before but I don't

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.800 
frequency that I have before but I don't
remember<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:28.040> let's<00:04:28.880> say<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.180> just<00:04:29.210> opened<00:04:29.750> the

program again now I'm gonna click on

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.280 
program again now I'm gonna click on
profile<00:04:32.120> number<00:04:32.270> one<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.110> going<00:04:33.230> to

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
profile number one and it's going to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.870 
profile number one and it's going to
overclock<00:04:33.590> automatically<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:34.580> just<00:04:34.730> need

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
overclock automatically and we just need
