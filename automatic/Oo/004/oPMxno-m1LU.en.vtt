00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
on all basically I have to do the front

shock<00:03:45.620> still<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.660> it'll<00:03:47.660> be<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.780> real<00:03:48.230> pain

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
shock still and it'll be a real pain

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.900 
shock still and it'll be a real pain
because<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:48.860> got<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.100> pretty<00:03:49.459> much<00:03:49.550> take<00:03:49.820> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
because I got to pretty much take the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.510 
because I got to pretty much take the
tire<00:03:50.150> off<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:51.530> just<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.860> lot<00:03:52.040> harder<00:03:52.280> to

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
tire off and it's just a lot harder to

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.680 
tire off and it's just a lot harder to
get<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.900> uh<00:03:55.000> I'll<00:03:56.000> make<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.239> video<00:03:56.450> about

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
get to so uh I'll make a video about

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.150 
get to so uh I'll make a video about
that<00:03:56.989> when<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.170> get<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.440> done<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.860> I'll<00:03:57.920> finally

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that when I get it done and I'll finally

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.580 
that when I get it done and I'll finally
do<00:03:58.340> what<00:03:58.370> drive<00:03:58.730> because

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
do what drive because

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.960 
do what drive because
haven't<00:03:59.830> done<00:03:59.950> any<00:04:00.010> drives<00:04:00.430> with<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.760> old
