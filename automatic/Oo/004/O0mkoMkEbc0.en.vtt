well with the subsurface modifier you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.580 
well with the subsurface modifier you

modifiers<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.210> doesn't<00:00:36.540> give<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.690> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a gold bar and we can Center it we

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
a gold bar and we can Center it we
probably<00:01:03.830> are<00:01:04.830> not<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> need<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.430> these

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
probably are not going to need all these

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.920 
probably are not going to need all these
faces<00:01:06.350> let's<00:01:07.350> first<00:01:07.619> convert<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.450> from<00:01:09.450> object

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
faces let's first convert it from object

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.340 
faces let's first convert it from object
type<00:01:10.140> text<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.189> object<00:01:11.820> type<00:01:12.060> curve<00:01:15.350> we're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
type text to object type curve we're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.140 
type text to object type curve we're
going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> reduce<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> number<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.759> control

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
going to reduce the number of control

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600 
going to reduce the number of control
points<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:19.320> we're<00:01:19.950> adding<00:01:20.189> subsurface

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
points just we're adding subsurface

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
points just we're adding subsurface
anyway<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.299> gets<00:01:21.509> rid<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:21.930> extra<00:01:22.229> faces

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
anyway this gets rid of some extra faces

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
anyway this gets rid of some extra faces
just<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> point<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> shape

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
just to the point that we get the shape

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.910 
just to the point that we get the shape
back<00:01:24.780> hit<00:01:25.259> 3d<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> outline<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
back hit 3d to get just the outline and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
back hit 3d to get just the outline and
this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.100> important<00:01:29.670> select<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.750> handles

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
this is important select all the handles

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.310 
this is important select all the handles
and<00:01:31.409> change<00:01:32.250> them<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.729> free<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.140> more

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and change them to free this will more

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
and change them to free this will more
evenly<00:01:34.619> distribute<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.340> points<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
evenly distribute your points so

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.620 
evenly distribute your points so
subsurface<00:01:36.630> our<00:01:37.560> subdivision<00:01:38.549> surface<00:01:39.210> won't

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
subsurface our subdivision surface won't

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.830 
subsurface our subdivision surface won't
change<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.920> shape<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.340> much<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.479> change

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
change the shape as much now we change

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.910 
change the shape as much now we change
the<00:01:43.020> object<00:01:43.409> type<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.759> mesh<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.049> we're

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the object type back to a mesh and we're

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
the object type back to a mesh and we're
going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> add<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.420> solidify<00:01:48.420> modifier<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
going to add a solidify modifier this is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.160 
going to add a solidify modifier this is
how<00:01:49.500> we're<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.070> our<00:01:50.310> extrusion

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
how we're going to get our extrusion

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.069 
how we're going to get our extrusion
along<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.530> normals<00:01:53.090> outward<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.659> text

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
along the normals outward from the text

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.209 
along the normals outward from the text
and<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.750> first<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.590> mechanics<00:01:59.100> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and this is first just the mechanics of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
and this is first just the mechanics of
dividing<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.790> mesh<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.420> two<00:02:00.600> parts<00:02:01.140> hit

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
dividing the mesh into two parts hit

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
dividing the mesh into two parts hit
ctrl<00:02:02.189> P<00:02:03.079> separate<00:02:04.079> by<00:02:05.040> selection<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> let's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
ctrl P separate by selection and let's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.119 
ctrl P separate by selection and let's
just<00:02:07.200> work<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> bottom<00:02:07.950> part<00:02:08.190> first

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
just work with the bottom part first

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.660 
just work with the bottom part first
solidify

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
solidify

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.900 
solidify
and<00:02:11.790> said<00:02:12.480> change<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> even<00:02:13.620> thickness<00:02:13.920> like

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and said change the even thickness like

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510 
and said change the even thickness like
a<00:02:15.060> beautiful<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.070> better<00:02:17.310> than

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
a beautiful that is this is better than

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.420 
a beautiful that is this is better than
doing<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.540> text<00:02:19.020> or<00:02:19.140> curves<00:02:19.590> because

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
doing it with the text or curves because

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.760 
doing it with the text or curves because
they<00:02:20.640> only<00:02:20.880> will<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.810> extrusion<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.590> one

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
they only will do extrusion in one

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
they only will do extrusion in one
direction<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.880> changes<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.510> plane<00:02:25.790> so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
direction and it changes the plane so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.870 
direction and it changes the plane so
now<00:02:26.820> let's<00:02:27.180> go<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.690> fill<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.260> faces<00:02:28.830> I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.220 

applied<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.030> modifier<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.810> rid<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.050> all

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
applied the modifier and got rid of all

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.100 
applied the modifier and got rid of all
the<00:02:34.380> vertices<00:02:34.680> except<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:35.970> plane<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the vertices except for one plane the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.340 
the vertices except for one plane the
bottom<00:02:37.440> plane<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.980> now<00:02:38.940> hit<00:02:39.240> alt<00:02:39.450> F<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:40.200> fill

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
bottom plane and now hit alt F to fill

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.790 
bottom plane and now hit alt F to fill
in<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> faces<00:02:41.240> we<00:02:42.240> can<00:02:42.450> try<00:02:42.690> getting<00:02:43.110> some<00:02:43.740> of

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
in the faces we can try getting some of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.770 
in the faces we can try getting some of
the<00:02:43.890> tries<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.340> quads<00:02:44.610> probably<00:02:45.360> won't<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.630> any

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the tries to quads probably won't do any

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.010 
the tries to quads probably won't do any
good

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
good

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.640 
good

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
hit ctrl I and we'll set up for later

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.320 
hit ctrl I and we'll set up for later
let's<00:02:50.489> go<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> top<00:02:51.120> part<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:54.120> will

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
let's go to the top part now we will

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.850 
let's go to the top part now we will
delete<00:02:54.540> these<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> little<00:02:55.260> bit<00:02:55.320> we<00:02:55.530> don't<00:02:55.560> need

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
delete these a little bit we don't need

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.740 
delete these a little bit we don't need
to<00:02:56.070> yet<00:02:56.370> first<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:57.060> need<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.360> apply<00:02:57.630> our

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.830 
to yet first we need to apply our
solidify<00:02:58.350> modifier<00:02:59.180> we<00:03:00.180> will<00:03:00.360> extrude

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
solidify modifier we will extrude

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.150 
solidify modifier we will extrude
outward<00:03:01.739> go<00:03:02.640> ahead<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:02.940> make<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.180> even<00:03:03.540> just

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
outward go ahead and make it even just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.590 
outward go ahead and make it even just
so<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.280> doesn't<00:03:05.489> overlap<00:03:05.700> don't<00:03:06.300> worry<00:03:06.450> too

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
so it doesn't overlap don't worry too

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.690 
so it doesn't overlap don't worry too
much<00:03:06.630> about<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.080> corners<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.040> won't<00:03:08.310> look<00:03:08.459> bad

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
much about the corners it won't look bad

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.780 
much about the corners it won't look bad
later<00:03:09.000> unless<00:03:09.300> you're<00:03:09.630> right<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.200> top<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.650> it

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
later unless you're right on top of it

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.060 
later unless you're right on top of it
don't<00:03:12.300> delete<00:03:12.540> those<00:03:12.720> yet<00:03:12.989> first<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.890> to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
don't delete those yet first we have to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.160 
don't delete those yet first we have to
apply<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.870> solidify<00:03:15.870> modifier<00:03:17.930> okay<00:03:18.930> now

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
apply the solidify modifier okay now

we'll select all those on the bottom and
delete<00:03:21.360> them<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.940> let's<00:03:23.940> join<00:03:24.209> these<00:03:24.540> two

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
delete them and let's join these two

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.270 
delete them and let's join these two
with<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> ctrl<00:03:25.620> J<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.890> now<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:31.200> will<00:03:31.410> select<00:03:32.010> the

interior edges of the top and that's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.539 
interior edges of the top and that's
what<00:03:39.480> lines<00:03:39.720> up<00:03:39.930> directly<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> outside

just the face will subdivide down this
is<00:04:18.209> what<00:04:18.419> we<00:04:18.600> will<00:04:18.810> stitch<00:04:19.140> in<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.789> by

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
is what we will stitch in and by

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.550 
is what we will stitch in and by
subdividing<00:04:21.270> a<00:04:21.510> little<00:04:21.750> bit<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.080> will<00:04:22.260> help

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
subdividing a little bit it will help

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.730 
subdividing a little bit it will help
with<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.860> number<00:04:23.130> of

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740

points honest thing all the triangles
coming<00:04:26.139> into<00:04:26.289> just<00:04:26.590> four<00:04:26.830> points<00:04:27.070> we've<00:04:27.550> got

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
coming into just four points we've got

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.960 
coming into just four points we've got
it<00:04:27.880> spread<00:04:28.150> out<00:04:28.300> now<00:04:28.680> all<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:30.039> F<00:04:30.130> again<00:04:30.310> creates

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
it spread out now all to F again creates

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.990 
it spread out now all to F again creates
the<00:04:31.180> faces<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.160> look<00:04:33.160> what<00:04:33.340> happens<00:04:33.729> with<00:04:33.910> the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
the faces and look what happens with the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.060 
the faces and look what happens with the
subdivision<00:04:34.630> surface<00:04:34.660> nice<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.830> smooth

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
subdivision surface nice and smooth

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.040 
subdivision surface nice and smooth
because<00:04:36.370> all<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.120> edges<00:04:37.449> were<00:04:37.600> quads<00:04:40.050> so

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
because all of the edges were quads so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.350 
because all of the edges were quads so
I'm<00:04:41.289> going<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.500> spare<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.830> modeling<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.759> gold

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
I'm going to spare you modeling the gold

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.439 
I'm going to spare you modeling the gold
bar<00:04:43.750> we'll<00:04:44.380> skip<00:04:44.680> forward<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.430> having<00:04:46.210> it

bar we'll skip forward to having it
already<00:04:46.780> stitched<00:04:47.199> in<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:49.570> added<00:04:49.960> some

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
already stitched in I just added some

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:56.159 
already stitched in I just added some
control<00:04:50.650> loops<00:04:51.090> or<00:04:52.320> control<00:04:53.320> R<00:04:53.560> for<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:55.419> the

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
control loops or control R for the the

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.810 
control loops or control R for the the
loops<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.710> then<00:04:56.830> stitched<00:04:57.160> in<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.580> flat

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
loops and then stitched in this flat

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.990 
loops and then stitched in this flat
plate<00:04:58.090> we've<00:04:58.479> got<00:04:58.690> nice<00:04:59.020> quads<00:04:59.590> everywhere<00:05:00.460> we

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
plate we've got nice quads everywhere we

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.640 
plate we've got nice quads everywhere we
need<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.240> quad<00:05:01.599> so<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.960> can<00:05:02.080> use<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.259> bevel

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
need a quad so you can use a bevel

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.360 
need a quad so you can use a bevel
modifier<00:05:02.800> or<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.400> subdivision<00:05:03.849> surface<00:05:04.509> and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
modifier or a subdivision surface and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.950 
modifier or a subdivision surface and
look<00:05:06.370> how<00:05:06.550> nice<00:05:06.759> it<00:05:06.789> is<00:05:07.030> we'll<00:05:07.270> put<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.449> material

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
look how nice it is we'll put a material

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.620 
look how nice it is we'll put a material
on<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.590> nice<00:05:09.009> glossy<00:05:09.370> gold<00:05:09.849> coating<00:05:10.330> and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.480 

let's<00:05:13.630> render<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.020> in<00:05:14.110> cycles<00:05:14.590> by<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.250> way<00:05:15.460> I

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
let's render it in cycles by the way I

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.610 
let's render it in cycles by the way I
did<00:05:15.789> include<00:05:16.150> an<00:05:16.270> environment<00:05:16.810> already<00:05:16.930> this

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
did include an environment already this

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.700 
did include an environment already this
is<00:05:17.800> flat<00:05:18.070> shading<00:05:19.020> but<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.169> looks<00:05:20.410> good

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
is flat shading but it looks good

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.830 
is flat shading but it looks good
already<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.610> things<00:05:24.880> that<00:05:25.270> we'll

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
already one of the things that we'll

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.170 
already one of the things that we'll
find<00:05:26.199> is<00:05:26.410> if<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:26.680> put<00:05:27.099> smooth<00:05:27.490> shading<00:05:28.000> on

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
find is if you put smooth shading on

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.980 
find is if you put smooth shading on
along<00:05:29.080> edges<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:30.039> are<00:05:30.099> angled<00:05:31.030> quite<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.780> bit

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
along edges that are angled quite a bit

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.020 
along edges that are angled quite a bit
away<00:05:32.080> from<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.880> camera

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
away from the camera

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.980 
away from the camera
they'll<00:05:34.630> look<00:05:35.139> black<00:05:35.560> with<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.280> shiny<00:05:36.990> material

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
they'll look black with a shiny material

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.890 
they'll look black with a shiny material
like<00:05:38.169> this<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.940> let's<00:05:40.330> change<00:05:40.570> this<00:05:40.840> to

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
like this and let's change this to

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.990 
like this and let's change this to
smooth<00:05:41.409> you'll<00:05:42.220> get<00:05:42.400> an<00:05:42.490> idea<00:05:42.760> what<00:05:42.909> I'm

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
smooth you'll get an idea what I'm

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.279 
smooth you'll get an idea what I'm
talking<00:05:43.419> about

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.670 

still<00:05:47.289> looks<00:05:47.500> good<00:05:49.289> let's<00:05:50.289> take<00:05:50.500> off

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
still looks good let's take off

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.740 
still looks good let's take off
subdivision<00:05:51.430> surface<00:05:51.880> there<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.240> go<00:05:52.419> now

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
subdivision surface there you go now

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.210 
subdivision surface there you go now
it's<00:05:52.780> black<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:55.210> let's<00:05:55.960> put<00:05:56.169> it<00:05:56.289> back<00:05:56.470> on<00:05:56.770> and

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
it's black so let's put it back on and

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.270 
it's black so let's put it back on and
put<00:05:57.729> on<00:05:57.849> smooth<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.800> you're<00:05:59.800> done

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
put on smooth and you're done

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.520 
put on smooth and you're done
