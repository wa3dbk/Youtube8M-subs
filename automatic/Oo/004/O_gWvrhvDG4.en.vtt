to get any sort of a visual dynamism and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.219 
to get any sort of a visual dynamism and
that's<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.880> only<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.210> needed<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> model

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that's not only not needed in this model

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
that's not only not needed in this model
but<00:02:07.409> engaging<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.580> those<00:02:08.670> practices

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
but engaging in some of those practices

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.809 
but engaging in some of those practices
can<00:02:09.840> lead<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.229> less<00:02:10.530> predictable<00:02:10.860> or<00:02:11.430> just

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
can lead to less predictable or just

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
can lead to less predictable or just
incorrect<00:02:12.120> results<00:02:12.629> because<00:02:12.959> these

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
incorrect results because these

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.899 
incorrect results because these
extras<00:02:13.590> are<00:02:13.739> being<00:02:13.950> used<00:02:14.129> in<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> fundamentally

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
extras are being used in a fundamentally

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.479 
extras are being used in a fundamentally
different<00:02:14.969> way<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.930> became<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.319> very<00:02:16.489> automated

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
different way it became a very automated

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.479 
different way it became a very automated
process<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.840> we're<00:02:19.079> now<00:02:19.349> able<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.769> utilize

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
process and so we're now able to utilize

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.770 
process and so we're now able to utilize
a<00:02:20.879> diffuse<00:02:21.569> map<00:02:21.719> a<00:02:22.049> specular<00:02:23.040> map<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.540> gloss

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
a diffuse map a specular map the gloss

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.170 
a diffuse map a specular map the gloss
map<00:02:25.109> essentially<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.219> then<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.819> course<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
map essentially and then of course the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.239 
map essentially and then of course the
normal<00:02:27.450> map<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.049> those<00:02:28.260> things<00:02:28.499> put

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:29.249 
normal map and with those things put

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.220 
normal map and with those things put
together<00:02:29.340> everything<00:02:30.030> pretty<00:02:30.540> much<00:02:30.629> comes<00:02:31.019> in

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
together everything pretty much comes in

need to convert as you may know a new
technology<00:02:47.189> is<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.430> hard<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.909> find<00:02:48.209> a

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
technology is really hard to find a

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.300 
technology is really hard to find a
outsourced<00:02:49.200> vendor<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.159> take

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
outsourced vendor that can take

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.640 
outsourced vendor that can take
advantage<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.879> in<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.900> timely<00:02:52.049> manner<00:02:52.379> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
advantage of it in a timely manner and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.800 
advantage of it in a timely manner and
then<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.129> remember<00:02:53.189> the<00:02:53.790> blue<00:02:54.209> papillons

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
then I remember the blue papillons

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.539 
then I remember the blue papillons
actually<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.439> so<00:02:55.709> essentially<00:02:56.129> we're<00:02:56.250> taking

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
actually and so essentially we're taking

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.729 
actually and so essentially we're taking
these<00:02:56.699> textures<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.659> importing<00:02:58.560> them<00:02:58.709> into

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
these textures and importing them into

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.520 
these textures and importing them into
the<00:02:59.010> game<00:02:59.219> and<00:02:59.459> then<00:03:00.359> we'll<00:03:00.569> be<00:03:00.719> setting<00:03:01.379> them

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the game and then we'll be setting them

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.140 
the game and then we'll be setting them
up<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.129> materials<00:03:02.519> their<00:03:02.669> associated

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
up with the materials their associated

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.599 
up with the materials their associated
with<00:03:03.419> so<00:03:03.719> everything<00:03:04.620> has<00:03:04.889> gone<00:03:05.099> extremely

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
with so everything has gone extremely

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.429 
with so everything has gone extremely
smoothly<00:03:05.939> everything<00:03:06.329> looks<00:03:06.780> great<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.349> know

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
smoothly everything looks great you know

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.509 
smoothly everything looks great you know
it's<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.650> lot<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.799> work<00:03:07.919> but<00:03:08.099> it's<00:03:08.280> totally

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
it's a lot of work but it's totally

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.429 
it's a lot of work but it's totally
totally<00:03:09.150> worth<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.449> we're<00:03:09.900> putting<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> lot<00:03:10.409> of

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
totally worth it we're putting a lot of

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.890 
totally worth it we're putting a lot of
content<00:03:10.919> into<00:03:11.669> the<00:03:11.790> game<00:03:11.969> even<00:03:12.689> though<00:03:12.750> it's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
content into the game even though it's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.390 
content into the game even though it's
essentially<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.379> same<00:03:13.620> content<00:03:14.219> we're

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
essentially the same content we're

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.699 
essentially the same content we're
updating<00:03:14.579> everything<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.689> a<00:03:15.719> tee<00:03:16.049> as<00:03:16.439> it<00:03:16.620> goes

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
updating everything to a tee as it goes

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.499 
updating everything to a tee as it goes
along<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.310> more<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.790> further<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.120> go<00:03:18.299> along

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:18.509 
along the more the further we go along

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.360 
along the more the further we go along
the<00:03:19.139> more<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.500> more<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.709> becomes<00:03:19.979> this<00:03:20.189> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the more and more it becomes this you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.339 
the more and more it becomes this you
know<00:03:20.489> cohesive<00:03:21.030> beautiful<00:03:21.449> scene<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:22.319> I

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
know cohesive beautiful scene that I

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.229 
know cohesive beautiful scene that I
can't<00:03:22.829> stop<00:03:23.040> looking<00:03:23.189> at<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:24.000> next

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
can't stop looking at and so the next

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.689 
can't stop looking at and so the next
step<00:03:24.389> for<00:03:24.509> us<00:03:24.689> now<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.560> we've<00:03:25.680> made<00:03:26.159> such<00:03:26.669> a
