don't<00:01:01.090> start<00:01:01.390> stretching<00:01:01.660> first<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.170> all<00:01:02.320> go

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
don't start stretching first of all go

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.950 
don't start stretching first of all go
for<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.309> five-minute<00:01:03.700> run<00:01:04.000> get<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:04.479> walk<00:01:04.690> get

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
for a five-minute run get that walk get

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.230 
for a five-minute run get that walk get
that<00:01:05.080> heart<00:01:05.290> rate<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.790> then<00:01:07.000> there's<00:01:07.180> a

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
that heart rate going and then there's a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.540 
that heart rate going and then there's a
runner<00:01:07.510> we'd<00:01:08.290> only<00:01:08.530> be<00:01:08.650> stretching<00:01:09.070> too<00:01:09.310> long

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
runner we'd only be stretching too long

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.530 
runner we'd only be stretching too long
okay

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
okay

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.960 
okay
especially<00:01:11.229> as<00:01:11.320> time<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.800> Essen<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.640> what<00:01:12.820> I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
especially as time is Essen so what I

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.270 
especially as time is Essen so what I
would<00:01:13.180> recommend<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.810> always<00:01:14.080> stretch<00:01:15.070> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
would recommend you always stretch the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.870 
would recommend you always stretch the
muscles<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:16.630> are<00:01:16.840> key<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.110> your<00:01:17.530> running<00:01:17.880> so

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
muscles that are key to your running so

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.630 
muscles that are key to your running so
for<00:01:19.090> example<00:01:19.630> your<00:01:19.899> groin<00:01:20.200> muscle<00:01:20.590> here<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:21.369> an

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
for example your groin muscle here is an

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.430 
for example your groin muscle here is an
important<00:01:22.060> muscle<00:01:22.330> but<00:01:22.540> it's<00:01:22.660> not<00:01:22.840> key<00:01:23.110> to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
important muscle but it's not key to

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.260 
important muscle but it's not key to
running<00:01:23.710> because<00:01:24.100> when<00:01:24.280> we<00:01:24.399> run<00:01:24.610> we<00:01:24.820> run<00:01:25.149> in

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
running because when we run we run in

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.570 
running because when we run we run in
one<00:01:25.390> direction<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.680> groin<00:01:26.890> muscle<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.369> course

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
one direction the groin muscle of course

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.980 
one direction the groin muscle of course

weather plays very important we do a lot
of<00:01:30.820> twisting<00:01:31.410> but<00:01:32.410> for<00:01:32.590> running<00:01:32.920> we<00:01:33.520> need<00:01:33.670> to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
of twisting but for running we need to

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.150 
of twisting but for running we need to
warm<00:01:34.090> up<00:01:34.240> our<00:01:34.450> calf<00:01:35.020> muscle<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.619> our<00:01:35.860> calf

warm up our calf muscle and our calf

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.210 
warm up our calf muscle and our calf
muscle<00:01:36.550> here<00:01:36.790> goes<00:01:37.450> in<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.229> two<00:01:38.470> parts<00:01:38.890> we

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
muscle here goes in to the two parts we

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.260 
muscle here goes in to the two parts we
have<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.399> gastrocnemius

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270
