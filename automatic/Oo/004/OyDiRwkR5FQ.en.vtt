them I don't have a fear its tab I don't

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.680 
them I don't have a fear its tab I don't
really<00:02:34.769> don't<00:02:35.010> need<00:02:35.099> one<00:02:37.010> from<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.690> mean

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
really don't need one from there I mean

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.580 
really don't need one from there I mean
I<00:02:39.780> find<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.739> lot<00:02:41.610> simpler<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.630> use<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
I find it to be a lot simpler to use the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.759 
I find it to be a lot simpler to use the
one<00:02:43.769> downside<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.819> does<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.769> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
one downside of it it does not have the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.570 
one downside of it it does not have the
ability<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.250> follow<00:02:47.670> or<00:02:48.030> view<00:02:48.660> trends<00:02:49.580> tweety

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
ability to follow or view trends tweety

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.190 
ability to follow or view trends tweety
did<00:02:50.819> have<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.660> didn't<00:02:51.900> use<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.049> much

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
did have that but I didn't use it much

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.470 
did have that but I didn't use it much
at<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.519> really<00:02:54.000> don't<00:02:54.060> care<00:02:54.180> what's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
at all really I really don't care what's

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.199 
at all really I really don't care what's
going<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.380> most<00:02:58.530> part<00:02:58.680> it's

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
going on but for the most part it's

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.570 
going on but for the most part it's
smoother<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.660> click<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:01.650> here<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:02.220> you

from that I just really like the
interface<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:16.170> looks<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.650> interface<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
interface it looks the interface is a

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.770 
interface it looks the interface is a
lot<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.400> Tweety<00:03:17.700> pie<00:03:18.350> except<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.560> swipe

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
lot like Tweety pie except you can swipe

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.509 
lot like Tweety pie except you can swipe
back<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.959> forth<00:03:22.200> or<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.829> can<00:03:22.980> hit<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> bottom

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
back and forth or you can hit the bottom

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.599

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
button and swipe it this way and I just

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.830 
button and swipe it this way and I just
found<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> apt<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.450> useful<00:03:30.510> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
found the apt to be very useful and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.910 
found the apt to be very useful and
worth<00:03:31.609> a<00:03:32.609> review<00:03:33.540> from<00:03:33.660> me<00:03:33.900> because<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.709> really

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
