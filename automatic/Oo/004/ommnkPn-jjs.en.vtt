00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
multiple uses and what else this is the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.220 
multiple uses and what else this is the
basic<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.730> want<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.150> change<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> basic

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
basic I want a change this is the basic

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.890 
basic I want a change this is the basic
type<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.560> thing<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.829> comes<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.280> tube<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.790> I

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
type of thing it comes in a tube and I

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.270 
type of thing it comes in a tube and I
think<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.019> also<00:03:16.320> available<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:17.010> bigger

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
think it's also available in bigger

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.030 
think it's also available in bigger
sizes<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> smallest<00:03:18.989> size<00:03:19.980> they

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
sizes this is the smallest size they

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.120 
sizes this is the smallest size they
have<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.200> doesn't<00:03:25.440> really<00:03:25.769> have

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
have so it is it doesn't really have

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.890 
have so it is it doesn't really have
more<00:03:27.120> chemicals<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.170> will<00:03:28.650> prove<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.700> will<00:03:30.630> take

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
