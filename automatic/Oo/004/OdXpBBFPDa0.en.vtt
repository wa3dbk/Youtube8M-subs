tutorial so I'm jumping way ahead here
this<00:00:39.219> list<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:40.460> lick<00:00:40.879> is<00:00:41.120> really<00:00:41.629> advanced

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
this list this lick is really advanced

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.810 
this list this lick is really advanced
stuff<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:42.980> course<00:00:43.190> you've<00:00:43.370> got<00:00:43.399> to<00:00:43.579> learn

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
stuff and of course you've got to learn

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.880 
stuff and of course you've got to learn
how<00:00:43.999> to<00:00:44.030> crawl<00:00:44.780> before<00:00:45.019> you<00:00:45.199> can<00:00:45.260> walk<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.829> you

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
how to crawl before you can walk and you

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.079 
how to crawl before you can walk and you
gotta<00:00:46.100> learn<00:00:46.219> how<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.370> walk<00:00:46.609> before<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:46.999> can

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
gotta learn how to walk before you can

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.750 
gotta learn how to walk before you can
run<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.920> tune<00:00:49.129> is<00:00:49.249> definitely<00:00:49.579> running

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
run and this tune is definitely running

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.450 
run and this tune is definitely running
so<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.690> recap<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.140> lick<00:00:51.559> I'll<00:00:52.039> do<00:00:52.219> it<00:00:52.339> a<00:00:52.370> little

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
so to recap the lick I'll do it a little

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:02.950 
so to recap the lick I'll do it a little
bit<00:00:52.699> slower<00:00:52.820> than<00:00:53.089> me<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.719> recording<00:01:01.960> so

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
bit slower than me on the recording so

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.079 
bit slower than me on the recording so
what<00:01:03.079> I'm<00:01:03.199> doing<00:01:03.469> up<00:01:03.589> there<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:04.190> I'm<00:01:04.790> over

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
what I'm doing up there is I'm over

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.020 
what I'm doing up there is I'm over
blowing<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.380> G<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.100> B<00:01:07.130> flaw<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.729> get<00:01:07.880> the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
blowing the G and the B flaw to get the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.660 
blowing the G and the B flaw to get the
fifth<00:01:08.510> harmonic<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:09.860> we're<00:01:10.040> actually<00:01:10.190> hearing

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
fifth harmonic so we're actually hearing

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:25.180 
fifth harmonic so we're actually hearing
D<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.780> F<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.470> D<00:01:13.070> F<00:01:13.370> sharp<00:01:13.840> okay<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:24.920> order

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
D and F and D F sharp okay and in order

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.270 
D and F and D F sharp okay and in order
to<00:01:25.370> do<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.180> portamento<00:01:26.600> between<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.320> G<00:01:28.190> and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
to do the portamento between the G and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.870 
to do the portamento between the G and
the<00:01:28.340> B<00:01:28.370> flat<00:01:28.670> D<00:01:29.300> F<00:01:29.330> I<00:01:30.140> have<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:31.280> course<00:01:31.340> have

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the B flat D F I have to of course have

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.510 
the B flat D F I have to of course have
my<00:01:32.090> proper<00:01:32.510> left<00:01:32.810> hand<00:01:33.370> fundamental<00:01:34.370> position

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
my proper left hand fundamental position

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.970 
my proper left hand fundamental position
which<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.180> addressed<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:36.110> great<00:01:36.320> detail<00:01:36.740> in

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
which is addressed in great detail in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.820 
which is addressed in great detail in
the<00:01:37.300> first<00:01:38.300> lesson<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.230> six<00:01:39.470> lesson

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
the first lesson of the six lesson

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.360 
the first lesson of the six lesson
tutorial<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.470> I'll<00:01:42.590> slow<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.950> down<00:01:43.130> for<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
tutorial so I'll slow that down for a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
tutorial so I'll slow that down for a
little<00:01:43.520> bit

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.480 

okay<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.450> I'm<00:01:53.689> toggling<00:01:54.170> between<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.740> double

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
okay so I'm toggling between the double

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.370 
okay so I'm toggling between the double
thumb<00:01:55.700> be<00:01:55.969> flogged<00:01:56.270> fingering<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.140> the

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
thumb be flogged fingering and the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.770 
thumb be flogged fingering and the
regular<00:01:57.799> b-flat<00:01:58.399> now<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.939> course<00:01:59.090> we're

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
regular b-flat now of course we're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.580 
regular b-flat now of course we're
taught<00:01:59.990> never<00:02:00.319> to<00:02:00.520> slide<00:02:01.520> those<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.719> thumb

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
taught never to slide those the thumb

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.679 
taught never to slide those the thumb
between<00:02:03.950> those<00:02:04.069> two<00:02:04.219> notes<00:02:04.429> but<00:02:04.729> in<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.450> case

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
between those two notes but in this case

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.029 
between those two notes but in this case
I'm<00:02:05.929> giving<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.319> permission<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.770> do<00:02:06.890> that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
what I call the frontal between the G

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.449 
what I call the frontal between the G
and<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.200> B<00:02:15.230> flat<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> G<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.430> B

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
and the B flat and then the G and the B

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.100 
and the B flat and then the G and the B
you've<00:02:16.970> got<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.239> be<00:02:17.330> able<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> toggle<00:02:17.840> your

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you've got to be able to toggle your

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.440 
you've got to be able to toggle your
thumb<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.549> forth<00:02:19.760> between<00:02:19.879> those<00:02:20.180> notes

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
thumb back and forth between those notes

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:39.880 
thumb back and forth between those notes
okay<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:30.069> okay<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.340> then<00:02:32.180> finally<00:02:38.739> we're<00:02:39.739> just

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
okay so okay and then finally we're just

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.119 
okay so okay and then finally we're just
on<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.010> cones<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:40.879> I<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.690> long

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
on the cones and then I do a long

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:51.460 
on the cones and then I do a long
portamento<00:02:43.129> fall<00:02:43.579> off<00:02:49.900> end<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.290> my
