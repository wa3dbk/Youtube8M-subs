00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.660 

now<00:00:08.290> we're<00:00:08.410> going<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.619> discuss<00:00:09.100> the<00:00:09.430> cutter

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
now we're going to discuss the cutter

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.150 
now we're going to discuss the cutter
the<00:00:10.209> cutter<00:00:10.480> would<00:00:10.690> be<00:00:10.869> a<00:00:10.900> precursor<00:00:11.440> into<00:00:12.039> the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
the cutter would be a precursor into the

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.900 
the cutter would be a precursor into the
slider<00:00:12.459> and<00:00:12.789> the<00:00:13.420> cutter<00:00:13.690> would<00:00:13.990> be<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.789> lot<00:00:15.789> of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
slider and the cutter would be a lot of

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.310 
slider and the cutter would be a lot of
different<00:00:16.240> ways<00:00:16.359> we<00:00:16.570> could<00:00:16.720> talk<00:00:16.930> about<00:00:17.080> the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
different ways we could talk about the

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.910 
different ways we could talk about the
cutter<00:00:17.530> one<00:00:17.950> is<00:00:18.190> it's<00:00:19.180> an<00:00:19.330> offset<00:00:19.840> fastball<00:00:20.410> so

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
cutter one is it's an offset fastball so

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.279 
cutter one is it's an offset fastball so
it's<00:00:21.220> a<00:00:21.340> safer<00:00:21.820> pitch<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.420> more<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.870> a<00:00:22.990> one

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
it's a safer pitch it's more of a one

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.680 
it's a safer pitch it's more of a one
plane<00:00:23.650> pitch<00:00:24.039> which<00:00:24.760> means<00:00:25.060> that<00:00:25.270> it<00:00:25.420> moves

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
plane pitch which means that it moves

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.620 
plane pitch which means that it moves
more<00:00:25.960> east<00:00:26.260> to<00:00:26.500> west<00:00:26.740> without<00:00:27.520> going<00:00:28.000> down<00:00:28.270> at

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
more east to west without going down at

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.439 
more east to west without going down at
the<00:00:28.840> same<00:00:29.080> time<00:00:29.440> so<00:00:29.980> it's<00:00:30.610> an<00:00:30.760> effective<00:00:31.240> pitch

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
the same time so it's an effective pitch

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.900 
the same time so it's an effective pitch
for<00:00:31.480> right-handed<00:00:32.439> pitchers<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:33.430> cannot

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
for right-handed pitchers that cannot

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.370 
for right-handed pitchers that cannot
effectively<00:00:34.600> get<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.930> ball<00:00:35.110> into

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
effectively get the ball into

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.950 
effectively get the ball into
left-handed<00:00:36.100> hitters<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:36.940> they<00:00:37.150> add<00:00:37.329> the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
left-handed hitters so they add the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.110 
left-handed hitters so they add the
ability<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.470> throw<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.190> outside<00:00:39.640> part<00:00:40.000> of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
ability to throw to the outside part of

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.729 
ability to throw to the outside part of
the<00:00:40.180> ball<00:00:40.239> essentially<00:00:41.079> off<00:00:41.200> their<00:00:41.380> fastball

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
the ball essentially off their fastball

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.710 
the ball essentially off their fastball
to<00:00:42.250> be<00:00:42.399> able<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.640> have<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.970> ball<00:00:43.149> move<00:00:43.180> this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
to be able to have the ball move this

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.610 
to be able to have the ball move this
way<00:00:43.930> and<00:00:43.960> miss<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.530> center<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.070> bat<00:00:45.280> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
way and miss the center of the bat so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590 
way and miss the center of the bat so
essentially<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.770> grips<00:00:48.070> again<00:00:48.550> can<00:00:48.910> vary<00:00:49.210> you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
essentially the grips again can vary you

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.240 
essentially the grips again can vary you
can<00:00:49.750> vary<00:00:49.989> quite<00:00:50.200> a<00:00:50.290> bit<00:00:50.410> there's<00:00:50.860> your<00:00:51.070> four

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
can vary quite a bit there's your four

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.479 
can vary quite a bit there's your four
seam<00:00:51.489> fastball<00:00:51.910> you<00:00:52.390> can<00:00:52.570> offset<00:00:52.780> your

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
seam fastball you can offset your

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.970 
seam fastball you can offset your
forcing<00:00:54.489> grip<00:00:55.030> into<00:00:55.630> this<00:00:55.780> area<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.350> when<00:00:56.800> we

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
forcing grip into this area and when we

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.830 
forcing grip into this area and when we
throw<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.370> ball<00:00:57.550> we're<00:00:57.910> gonna<00:00:58.210> basically

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
throw the ball we're gonna basically

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.500 
throw the ball we're gonna basically
release<00:00:59.230> the<00:01:00.010> outside<00:01:00.430> part<00:01:00.730> of<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.850> ball<00:01:00.940> but

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
release the outside part of the ball but

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.679 
release the outside part of the ball but
our<00:01:01.780> grip<00:01:02.110> kind<00:01:02.770> of<00:01:02.860> facilitates<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.689> I've

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
our grip kind of facilitates that I've

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.690 
our grip kind of facilitates that I've
seen<00:01:04.989> other<00:01:05.199> guys<00:01:05.439> where<00:01:05.740> they<00:01:05.920> have<00:01:06.429> moved

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
seen other guys where they have moved

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.940 
seen other guys where they have moved
the<00:01:06.819> ball<00:01:07.030> on<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.359> inside<00:01:07.509> portion<00:01:08.139> of<00:01:08.499> it<00:01:08.740> so

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
the ball on the inside portion of it so

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.010 
the ball on the inside portion of it so
again<00:01:09.579> what<00:01:09.909> we're<00:01:10.060> trying<00:01:10.270> not<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.569> do<00:01:10.869> is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
again what we're trying not to do is

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.389 
again what we're trying not to do is
we're<00:01:11.170> not<00:01:11.259> trying<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.649> get<00:01:11.829> to<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.069> front<00:01:12.310> of

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
we're not trying to get to the front of

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.919 
we're not trying to get to the front of
the<00:01:12.459> ball<00:01:12.639> we're<00:01:12.850> trying<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.149> stay<00:01:13.389> behind<00:01:13.630> the

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
the ball we're trying to stay behind the

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.199 
the ball we're trying to stay behind the
ball<00:01:14.170> with<00:01:14.409> our<00:01:14.590> wrist<00:01:14.889> and<00:01:15.189> it's<00:01:15.520> gonna<00:01:15.729> be<00:01:15.999> a

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
ball with our wrist and it's gonna be a

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.499 
ball with our wrist and it's gonna be a
very<00:01:16.779> higher<00:01:17.709> velocity<00:01:18.520> pitch<00:01:18.759> than<00:01:19.029> any<00:01:19.270> of

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
very higher velocity pitch than any of

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.149 
very higher velocity pitch than any of
your<00:01:19.689> breaking<00:01:20.049> balls<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.409> probably<00:01:20.950> will<00:01:21.130> be

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
your breaking balls it probably will be

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.489 
your breaking balls it probably will be
more<00:01:21.310> towards<00:01:21.880> your<00:01:21.999> forcing<00:01:22.420> fastball<00:01:22.959> than

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
more towards your forcing fastball than

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.289 
more towards your forcing fastball than
it<00:01:23.619> will<00:01:23.770> be<00:01:23.829> toward<00:01:24.279> your<00:01:24.429> slider<00:01:24.700> speed<00:01:25.029> and

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
it will be toward your slider speed and

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.319 
it will be toward your slider speed and
your<00:01:25.899> curveball<00:01:26.229> speed<00:01:26.709> I've<00:01:27.399> seen<00:01:27.789> guys<00:01:27.969> been

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
your curveball speed I've seen guys been

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.269 
your curveball speed I've seen guys been
able<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.659> throw<00:01:29.139> it<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:32.439> they<00:01:32.679> they've

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:33.279 
able to throw it where they they've

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.849 
able to throw it where they they've
taken<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:33.849> in<00:01:33.999> this<00:01:34.179> aspect<00:01:34.630> where<00:01:35.139> they've

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
taken it in this aspect where they've

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.339 
taken it in this aspect where they've
gone<00:01:36.069> across<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.729> two<00:01:36.939> seams<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.479> all<00:01:37.869> again

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
gone across the two seams and all again

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.289 
gone across the two seams and all again
all<00:01:38.649> they're<00:01:38.859> doing<00:01:39.249> is<00:01:39.399> staying<00:01:39.609> behind<00:01:39.909> the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
all they're doing is staying behind the

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.359 
all they're doing is staying behind the
ball<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.869> working<00:01:41.469> on<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.679> outside<00:01:42.039> part<00:01:42.340> of

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
ball and working on the outside part of

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:42.989 
ball and working on the outside part of
the<00:01:42.429> ball

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
the ball

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.029 
the ball
we<00:01:43.479> have<00:01:43.630> tried<00:01:43.869> drills<00:01:44.319> where<00:01:44.590> we've<00:01:44.799> gone

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
we have tried drills where we've gone

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.949 
we have tried drills where we've gone
with<00:01:45.399> this<00:01:45.729> where<00:01:46.029> we've<00:01:46.240> talked<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:46.719> wrist

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
with this where we've talked to wrist

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.929 
with this where we've talked to wrist
where<00:01:47.259> we<00:01:47.409> preset<00:01:47.889> cocking<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.459> wrist<00:01:48.669> and

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
where we preset cocking the wrist and

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.879 
where we preset cocking the wrist and
essentially<00:01:49.779> they<00:01:49.959> throw<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.380> ball<00:01:50.529> with<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
essentially they throw the ball with the

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.639 
essentially they throw the ball with the
preset<00:01:51.369> risk<00:01:52.329> talk<00:01:52.539> so<00:01:52.749> they<00:01:52.869> understand<00:01:53.380> just

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
preset risk talk so they understand just

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.649
