00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the orientation of this so that the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.040 
the orientation of this so that the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
right leg is in front that's your wrap

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.250 
right leg is in front that's your wrap
loop<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:51.459> if<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.760> two<00:02:51.940> together<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
loop and if the two together is the

row

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.179 

now<00:03:04.720> they<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:05.170> give<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.799> pretty<00:03:06.340> nice<00:03:06.610> finish

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
now they all give a pretty nice finish

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.970 
now they all give a pretty nice finish
to<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.340> short<00:03:09.670> row<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.959> just<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.530> matter<00:03:11.769> of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
to the short row it's just a matter of

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.449 
to the short row it's just a matter of
what<00:03:12.579> is<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.239> easiest<00:03:13.689> method<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.439> do<00:03:14.620> let<00:03:15.370> me

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
what is the easiest method to do let me

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.699 
what is the easiest method to do let me
just<00:03:15.610> purl<00:03:15.939> back<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.140> see<00:03:17.200> that

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
just purl back so you can see that

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.270 
just purl back so you can see that
fabric<00:03:18.280> once<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.329> short<00:03:19.599> rows<00:03:19.810> are<00:03:20.280> worked

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280

I<00:03:33.609> find<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:35.489> wrap<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.730> turn<00:03:36.879> is<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.299> fussy<00:03:37.930> pain

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
I find the wrap and turn is a fussy pain

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.949 
I find the wrap and turn is a fussy pain
in<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.590> bottom<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.150> as<00:03:40.659> nice<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
in the bottom it's not as nice the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.610 
in the bottom it's not as nice the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
finish as the Japanese short rows but

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.740

the<00:03:44.769> Japanese<00:03:45.250> short<00:03:45.519> rows<00:03:45.819> also<00:03:46.209> are<00:03:46.720> a

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the Japanese short rows also are a

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.360 
the Japanese short rows also are a
little<00:03:46.989> bit<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.349> a<00:03:47.409> pain<00:03:47.650> at<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.859> bottom<00:03:48.190> and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
they leave a visible mark on the back of

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.679 
they leave a visible mark on the back of
your<00:03:51.400> fabric<00:03:51.639> if<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:53.620> are<00:03:54.159> not<00:03:54.760> at<00:03:55.000> all<00:03:55.299> fussy

your fabric if you are not at all fussy

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.069 
your fabric if you are not at all fussy
about<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.409> then<00:03:57.099> that's<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.609> a<00:03:57.670> bad<00:03:57.909> thing

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
about that then that's not a bad thing

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.020 
about that then that's not a bad thing
but<00:03:59.079> if<00:03:59.349> that's<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.889> to<00:04:00.010> bug<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.609> then<00:04:00.879> you

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
might want to use my method which is

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.259 
might want to use my method which is
easier<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.060> do<00:04:04.359> and<00:04:05.040> doesn't<00:04:06.040> leave<00:04:06.280> loops<00:04:07.030> on
