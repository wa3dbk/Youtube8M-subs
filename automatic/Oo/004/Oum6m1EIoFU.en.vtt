00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 other times we watch the television program 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.160
 but we do not know the real costs 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.140
 of natural people let's say that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
 participate in this show because they are the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 limits are made clear that what is going 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.630
 to happen to talk about that and much more 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 We are on a mobile with nobody to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 barrientos nobody participated in a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.380
 chapter from hands to fire welcome to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.359
 nobody hello how about good morning 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 good morning nobody wants to know the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.029
 costs that brought you and participate in 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.289
 this program and I ran out of boyfriend that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.870
 it's because of the cost 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.399
 definitely because it happened like that 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.649
 it happened because of the good program in 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.530
 reality that if I do not know based on other 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.070
 things but even that broke our 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.410
 relationship 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.540
 the program like I'm not I'm not 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.370
 I'm not angry with the program or 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.110
 it seemed terrible on the contrary what 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.720
 I appreciate having the opportunity 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.030
 of being able to be in this situation and see 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.579
 how my boyfriend behaved in a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.180
 situation like that nobody had surprised you 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.129
 your boyfriend making you unfaithful how much was it 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.379
 who negotiated with you a little how 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.750
 the backstage of this program is managed 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.000
 silver is negotiated I'm not going to say 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.810
 When you negotiate you negotiate silver in addition 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.650
 of the prize that was patented so that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 he watches it from the people but but not or if he 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.280
 negotiate is negotiated from before but 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.640
 you do not have a certainty of what 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.470
 It will happen 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.360
 look at me I want to make you this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.760
 ask with all due respect but it is 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.729
 unavoidable to think that it is a little 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.830
 immoral expose your boyfriend to the person 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.900
 who wants in exchange for money finally 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.880
 because I know that you manage to catch on 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.500
 he was unfaithful and who deserves the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 sorrows of hell in my opinion but 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.740
 just like selling to your town because 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.509
 that's what I 'm doing 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 I did not feel it like that when I 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.229
 they offered this program 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.600
 to see I trusted a lot in my boyfriend 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.450
 and I said good is an opportunity to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 earn money to do something that I do not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 it seemed terrible and the truth is that if 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 I sat there is because I really 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.680
 entrusted to my girlfriend and I knew that she has 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.899
 ported as a prince to me was a 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.729
 situation in which I was going to feel 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.990
 very happy and I was going to look good and he 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.429
 It was also going to look good when the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.770
 relationship time they had nobody to 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.110
 you two and a half years two years and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 medium and it was worth it today weighing 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.820
 after seeing the events that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.720
 money for betraying that love of 21 yo 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.580
 I do not find 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 to see the silver I do not care I do not feel 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.590
 good to win this money is fine not 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.930
 it matters good I was left without boyfriend not me 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.750
 the silver to me I do not care this 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.970
 situation came to my life for something and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.340
 nothing I never thought that I would leave like this 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.260
 but hey it was a strong blow and everything 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.880
 but I got over it I'm fine and the truth 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.040
 is that I appreciate it there was not when you 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.540
 they call you and negotiate with you a sum of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 money in business you too for your 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 pololo or with the business apart once 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.090
 that he accepts that this is transmitted to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.990
 through television they give you another sum of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.550
 money to him is not just me alone 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.110
 with you but your business to him also 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.550
 he pays him later because he finally has 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.480
 to sign an authorization for 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.250
 follow 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.709
 he signed me when we finished 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.070
 the program he signed but because good 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.870
 I was very angry and nothing and depp and you 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.450
 I asked him to sign because I wanted this 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.370
 come out and see himself and also because he 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.890
 I wanted to go back with me and he said he's good 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.110
 well your signature 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.970
 no one is ready assures that the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.010
 counterpart of this case your boyfriend or ex 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.810
 boyfriend receives absolutely nothing 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.770
 because between direct and sign I am 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.620
 agree to go on television asked me 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.410
 because he signs a diet some time when 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.380
 once on the arm when you 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.210
 your business contacts how long 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.800
 team had the idea how much time 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.720
 since your business if you get to 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.550
 disagreement until they record you because 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.150
 one can say to see if days go by 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.220
 can put in accordance with the color is 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.780
 at the moment in the middle of the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.760
 channel that they do not really tell you to 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.550

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.980
 phone and it's immediate will be minutes in 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.470

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.070
 wallet and you will try everything in the 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.930

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.500

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.490
 quiet and everything but I had a very bad time 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.180
 I get a situation where I had to 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.860
 leave something that I did not want at the time 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.810
 in the minute with the anger he had with 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.069
 all the anger I said if signature signs 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.289
 because I wanted the whole world to see 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.199
 common as you deceived me you understand because 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.180
 I was frustrated but then to the days

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.520
 boyfriend that was nothing that there was no 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.310

 Well, I had already done it and they were not 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.630
