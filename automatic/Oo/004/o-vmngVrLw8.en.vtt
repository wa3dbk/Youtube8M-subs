the time war realises in that moment

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.060 
the time war realises in that moment
just<00:02:54.240> who<00:02:54.420> river<00:02:54.690> song<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.680> that's<00:02:55.890> why

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
to the weight of this mysterious point

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.900 
to the weight of this mysterious point
in<00:03:07.980> time<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.220> which<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.459> doctor<00:03:08.730> would<00:03:08.880> have

is<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:11.430> physical<00:03:11.850> manifestation<00:03:12.450> of

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
is the very physical manifestation of

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.610 
is the very physical manifestation of
the<00:03:12.630> history<00:03:12.870> recorded<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.470> ancient

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the history recorded in that ancient

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.290 
the history recorded in that ancient
book<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.040> TARDIS<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.520> in<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.880> moment<00:03:15.060> it

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
book in the TARDIS and in that moment it

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.550 
book in the TARDIS and in that moment it
only<00:03:15.420> becomes<00:03:15.690> all<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.959> more<00:03:16.050> real<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
only becomes all the more real to the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.840 
only becomes all the more real to the
doctor<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.520> what<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> believe

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850

bro take a seat hello so regarding Clara
tell<00:03:33.300> me<00:03:33.390> your<00:03:33.480> idea<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.019> know<00:03:34.110> about<00:03:34.350> fixed

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
tell me your idea you know about fixed

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.250 
tell me your idea you know about fixed
points<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.160> time<00:03:35.519> right<00:03:35.850> yes<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.420> believe<00:03:36.750> that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
points in time right yes I believe that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.670 
points in time right yes I believe that
Clara<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.950> fixed<00:03:38.250> person<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:38.880> time<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.500> if

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
Clara is a fixed person in time so if

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.560 
Clara is a fixed person in time so if
she<00:03:40.709> dies<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.489> she<00:03:41.550> will<00:03:41.730> reappear<00:03:42.150> somewhere

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
she dies and she will reappear somewhere

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.449 
she dies and she will reappear somewhere
again<00:03:43.080> in<00:03:43.350> ton<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.010> kind<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
again in ton so it's kind of like the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.910 
again in ton so it's kind of like the
paradoxes<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.930> doctor<00:03:46.290> talks<00:03:46.500> about<00:03:46.769> it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
paradoxes that the doctor talks about it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.830 
paradoxes that the doctor talks about it
in<00:03:46.950> time<00:03:47.489> travelers<00:03:47.970> paradoxes<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.510> resolve

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
in time travelers paradoxes that resolve

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.930 
in time travelers paradoxes that resolve
themselves<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.470> specifically<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.760> any

point in time for whatever reason she's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.930 
point in time for whatever reason she's
a<00:03:52.170> fixed<00:03:52.470> person<00:03:52.920> in<00:03:53.010> time<00:03:53.160> she<00:03:53.310> always<00:03:53.640> has<00:03:53.820> to

a fixed person in time she always has to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.050 
a fixed person in time she always has to
exist<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.540> if<00:03:55.160> she<00:03:56.160> were<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.310> die<00:03:56.610> the

exist and if she were to die the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.790 
exist and if she were to die the
universe<00:03:57.450> will<00:03:57.660> resolve<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:58.200> paradox<00:03:58.620> by

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
universe will resolve that paradox by
