00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.659
 so what are the different parts we advanced on the constitution 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.729
 for important differences he wrote 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.710
 and the loyalty away that not all stars are the same way 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.869
 a lot in different universes to each other but I know that the most 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 exhaustive possible so it was going to be a little bit heavy and complicated 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.569
 I think today 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.080
 then again by three main parts the mayor 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.500
 it's the best 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.300
 it's all that part 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.830
 on that plane 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.390
 mu ride in sleeve 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.130
 on sunday we go head 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.110
 so let's start with afp 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 cart we will pay the price just for laughs 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.800
 that's less than the killers of his emblem you produce what I'm going 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 not without what do you speak we can not quite like that 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.630
 on his head as before so little the list of countries of the world 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.700
 it was also the day I did not understand what is missing on him 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.799
 a mechanical shovel that will not serve to match the large ones that are hoisted 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.990
 so if you find too much mechanics or risk breaking the body 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.430
 that's how we want 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.470
 appalling 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.450
 no other things to say to my record at the brand logo that is 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.740
 lost wealth for the sake manchester city 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 to meet him certainly the lead we call pieces of wood 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.790
 generation of men come to me is the layer 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.660
 so that's his home 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660
 sneaky it's sometimes smes and drinks 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.980
 it will be mostly guitar including the ballot and the fact that we have under the 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.330
 sarcasm that does not have a sunmonu touch always at the same point as 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.400
 handle 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.590
 the state 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.660
 on this key we always said 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.170
 we have all been arrested who is still pursuing 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.800
 we call strawberries 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.890
 it's one of the most important pieces of the guitar without defeat 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.150
 six impassible phases are admitted 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.160
 we are a star who is unfair 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.460
 and we usually have 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 not always it depends on theoretical models ans small points 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.310
 on the sidelines so it's a setback to easily spot classes to say 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.209
 usually we have it 320 7 9 12 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.269
 but for jean-claude haigron compared to 3 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.540
 doubling of the network because it's a very important place like you 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.119
 will learn it during your other skin for this internship 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.759
 obviously all these little landmarks to his audience he was on the side the 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.450
 touch that we could see his weapon was leaning 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.450
 is that the talent 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.529
 on the other hand the cashier we notified of restitution the horns 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.690
 generally i think if psa owns the rise it's really white 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.039
 nene months 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.639
 what is called May 6 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.049
 whereas we have two located on ebitda according to alain 6 and 7 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.779
 I also know that it fires the fire it is true that it is very important 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.209
 for latecomers do not neglect 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.740
 let's go to melee 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.599
 while we will be able to their characteristics 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.899
 already on a good statistics korea world cup the coolest here 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:05.209
 we have the resource 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.609
 on the second we did 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.460
 the sliding game made a call at the table 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.909
 the street 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.829
 on the side 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.189
 what are called his sons 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.199
 and it starts again 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.579
 I find this 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.879
 no tears 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.099
 delight 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.530
 it will be honored we so we can also an asset of 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.889
 weight it's called unemployment 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.030
 in this would be a lot less plastic parts in this plan I'm reporting a 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.359
 little rude head 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.760
 this is the second obvious sign that we also call unemployment 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.039
 sections 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.269
 and we have little tips here 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.629
 even if they were bodies 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.069
 in his indictment would not necessarily have a tracking system that can 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.619
 to be long a closed loop a good thanks to different systems 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.529
 but the euro I was one of the big 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.479
 you will also notice a small gift of 6 6 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.619
 at these finals 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:00.699
 that you do not have before six hours later again this is a 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.909
 option because we had a quarter of an hour this oath protect the label 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.159
 is granted in this commune so when we do not see too much 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.969
 in hennebont a control there 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.000
 I show again this number 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.999
 it's not a concern 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.999
 you will notice that fewer than 15 experts do not mention that these 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.699
 I have a small stall there is what is called a cut bridge 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.840
 it must not go down 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.159
 it is the sensitive point 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.639
 we hope to be more realistic later demented on the lenglen under the by 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.960
 my departure 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.919
 not much to say except that me what can I do acoustic electro 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.790
 I have a big 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.630
 are they managed as soon as you have had different belligerents invisible 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.930
 it's going to be a big mistake of society as promised in writing 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.969
 there is somewhere opening up on a higher profit 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.900
 The settings 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.789
 philippe dufermont who joined us 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.589
 on the other hand unemployment here 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.860
 so I think of tools for statistics the body the handle be 

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.180
 such a defeat 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.639
 the touch the ball touches the handle 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.699
 the site 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:10.790
 the valley headquarters 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.740
 and the rest of his men 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.059
 almost all but these types of part make the used quite limited 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:18.920
 the group was evolving in a vacuum 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.620
 the penplus no longer and following of the culture 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.020
 so now 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.020
 moving to tactics 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.309
 we will find a part 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:30.509
 Okay 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.629
 the handle 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:32.849
 the head 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.780
 except that there suddenly we will not talk about the ump parade under the soft 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.940
 anthony does not really know where is it going to stop a wooden statue 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.370
 unlike the acoustic guitar we have 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.280
 3 this is the same for the burst the craze for the moment go ahead 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.620
 the cgt of the port 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.909
 I do not want the most important is palpable am proud 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.630
 were elected aesthetic 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.599
 between them 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.319
 this is done we will find 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.020
 the poodles 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.300
 which will serve me to cholet the horns 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.460
 if I asked you if we will find 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.529
 the key 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.059
 parties alterations 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.889
 and if the heads 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.189
 you'll see the opening season and if you get on the other spock it's a 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.659
 metal bar that runs through the handle is the cargo branch 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.110
 it does not exist later 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.580
 indeed dewatering better acoustic not always 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.960
 we also have our sponsors 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.529
 as for acoustics 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.669
 without the cause the difference with the vita what we will have 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:32.550
 microphones 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.159
 the mount in d3 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.059
 so that's fine I wanted to do and to new people 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:39.379
 and the setting buttons 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:40.360
 to adjust 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.230
 some big games to play with some exceptions 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.650
 unclassified 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.460
 world 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.289
 electric 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:47.639
 to have a different sound 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.979
 I write each axle different places 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.099
 the offensive spent about 6 at the easel 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.939
 we have different huge game systems the occurrence a shot next 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.110
 of a simple man and that's accurate 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.219
 he will have to go down 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.400
 ben saada his ambition what is called the art of living 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.180
 if you have a relationship then start a course with the exceeds 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.819
 if you are not fed up some fear for their advancement 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:15.550
 I wanted to have a call that too the bridge 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.490
 and more resistant as well as different 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.490
 in a championship more often courroye fasteners 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.520
 for the scheme seems that soloist has warned 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.520
 120 hours five years by their absence from the champions 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.930
 so I think I was forgotten 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.820
 so it will allow me to understand a little better how a constructor who 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.070
 I do not want to understand how people will talk about guitar 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.830
 this spiral website much more it needed everything 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.490
 - on the Haven 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.030
 it does not hurt to see that the ordeal is still appreciable in power 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.889
 things correctly 

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:51.499
 so now we'll move on to the next one to see how what all 

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:52.039
 it 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.889
 this is the builders this edition
