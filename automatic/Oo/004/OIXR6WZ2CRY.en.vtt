00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
quickly today I've gotten a lot of

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.919 
quickly today I've gotten a lot of
emails<00:00:15.709> uh<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.460> know<00:00:16.609> approaching<00:00:17.599> coma

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:17.929 
emails uh you know approaching coma

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.240 
emails uh you know approaching coma
proteins<00:00:18.349> that<00:00:18.470> I<00:00:18.529> support<00:00:19.099> have<00:00:19.759> been<00:00:20.169> tested

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
proteins that I support have been tested

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.759 
proteins that I support have been tested
tested<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:22.669> to<00:00:22.730> speak<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:24.080> protein<00:00:24.470> came

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
tested so to speak and the protein came

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.159 
tested so to speak and the protein came
out<00:00:24.949> low<00:00:25.249> and<00:00:25.849> I<00:00:26.449> think<00:00:26.779> there's<00:00:26.929> a<00:00:26.990> big

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
out low and I think there's a big

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.159 
out low and I think there's a big
misunderstanding<00:00:27.470> on<00:00:27.949> lab<00:00:28.160> tests<00:00:28.460> now<00:00:28.699> i<00:00:29.169> will

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
misunderstanding on lab tests now i will

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.639 
misunderstanding on lab tests now i will
say<00:00:30.409> for<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.039> record<00:00:31.220> that<00:00:32.079> it<00:00:33.079> does<00:00:33.440> nothing

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
say for the record that it does nothing

second year anyway um let me go over
some<00:00:50.030> reasons<00:00:50.359> why<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:50.899> lab<00:00:51.679> test<00:00:51.980> can<00:00:52.690> come<00:00:53.690> out

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
some reasons why a lab test can come out

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.520 
some reasons why a lab test can come out
with<00:00:54.079> different<00:00:54.109> values<00:00:54.760> why<00:00:56.050> you<00:00:57.050> might<00:00:57.260> see

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
with different values why you might see

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.189 
with different values why you might see
some<00:00:57.769> trusted<00:00:58.160> companies<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:58.820> I've<00:00:59.390> tested

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199

whatever I'm just say

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.640

that<00:02:10.640> there<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:11.120> proteins<00:02:11.960> mentioned<00:02:12.560> in

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
that report that I've tested and they

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.500 
that report that I've tested and they
came<00:02:15.380> out<00:02:15.410> fine<00:02:15.830> plus<00:02:16.430> minus<00:02:16.730> ten<00:02:17.090> percent

came out fine plus minus ten percent

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360

which<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.140> range<00:02:18.380> we<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.740> go<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> I'll

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
which is the range we have to go to I'll

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.460 
which is the range we have to go to I'll
get<00:02:19.850> into<00:02:20.000> why<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.750> important<00:02:21.200> later<00:02:21.320> on

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
get into why that is important later on

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.160

another<00:02:22.280> reason<00:02:22.640> lab<00:02:22.760> analyses<00:02:23.330> might<00:02:23.690> not<00:02:23.900> be

think<00:03:03.980> about<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.430> if<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.970> were<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.240> mix<00:03:05.480> up<00:03:05.720> ten

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530

grams<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:07.010> powder<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.670> would<00:03:08.510> be<00:03:08.660> less<00:03:08.870> uniform

if<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.770> split<00:03:10.100> it<00:03:10.160> up<00:03:10.280> into<00:03:10.400> 20<00:03:10.850> servings<00:03:11.270> as

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
if you split it up into 20 servings as

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.890 
if you split it up into 20 servings as
if<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.200> did<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.590> hundred<00:03:13.510> thousand<00:03:14.510> grams<00:03:14.720> of

if you did a hundred thousand grams of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
if you did a hundred thousand grams of
powder<00:03:15.110> there's<00:03:15.650> more<00:03:15.920> stuff<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.490> move<00:03:16.580> around

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
powder there's more stuff to move around

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.670 
powder there's more stuff to move around
more<00:03:17.030> places<00:03:17.330> ago<00:03:17.750> but<00:03:18.230> they're<00:03:18.380> still<00:03:18.500> going

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
more places ago but they're still going

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.520 
more places ago but they're still going
to<00:03:18.770> be<00:03:18.860> areas<00:03:19.280> where<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.490> might<00:03:19.730> have<00:03:20.530> 22

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
slight variance you can blend that shit

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.430 
slight variance you can blend that shit
all<00:03:25.430> day<00:03:25.640> all<00:03:25.850> night<00:03:26.090> bottom<00:03:26.930> line<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.260> they'll

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
all day all night bottom line is they'll

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.230 
all day all night bottom line is they'll
still<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.740> slight<00:03:28.040> variance<00:03:28.610> in<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.850> blend

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
still be a slight variance in the blend

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.840 
still be a slight variance in the blend
um<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.440> what<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.710> need<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.920> look<00:03:31.070> for<00:03:31.340> honestly

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
um so what you need to look for honestly

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.960 
um so what you need to look for honestly
is<00:03:32.470> companies<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.620> trust<00:03:33.920> companies<00:03:34.880> you

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
is companies you trust companies you

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.070 
is companies you trust companies you
stand<00:03:35.240> behind<00:03:35.390> because<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.720> get<00:03:35.810> all<00:03:35.930> the

stand behind because you get all the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
can actually prove something to you but

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.160 
can actually prove something to you but
I<00:03:39.950> won't<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.490> can<00:03:41.030> take<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.210> random<00:03:41.450> product<00:03:42.020> and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
I won't I can take a random product and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.230 
I won't I can take a random product and
