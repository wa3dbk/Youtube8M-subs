00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.659
 The odyssey in space I 'm going to record 

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.969

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.889
 Friday of this week and stay 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.509
 eye and thought to have video 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:05.029
 this book here probably i saw you 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.770
 That night too, it 's a book. 

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:09.810
 short touch to the fourth ofelia 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.980
 written by fernando person was taken 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.599
 girlfriend wins from him and without help people 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.160

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.930
 video ahead too 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.300
 So you see, this was a hefty one. 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.040
 in the system then adding the letters 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.530
 from fernando pessoa 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.100
 I already started to lew I read this book by 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.500
 two days 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.580
 or the 200-page law of it that I 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.470
 I'm pretty round, I do not know. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.180
 What am I thinking is still too early? 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.090
 to say anything I liked 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.550
 much from the beginning then the book already begins 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.930
 with action scenes so you already know what 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.550
 will happen we do not know 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.890
 exactly what's happening to us 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.070
 Imagine for the estate you already have on the cover 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.890
 and the title and everything else but then the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.450
 beginning of the first part of the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.380
 movie from the book called me a lot 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 attention 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.440
 but the second third no longer gave a 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 It's over, so I do not think so 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.900
 of this book that is not 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.210
 Nice to meet you, but I do not know. 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.750
 a lot goes with them for you not too much 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.770
 soon only 200 pages are more than 95 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.290
 huh 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.280
 so I hope he stays more 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.430
 cool 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.890
 anyway we liked it or not at all 500 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.480
 pages I still read I read only the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.730
 according to literature and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.920
 psychoanalysis but I'm already crazy to read 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.650
 third because the third is over bridge 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.040
 joyce lacan and the laughing of letters 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.170
 December cards are interesting this here 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880
 Okay, so do not take too long for him. 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.080
 and I'm not going to look for another text 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.960

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.090

 there are other books here that I want 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.510

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.200

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.530

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.270

 edit here people are beautiful 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.800
 I think it's even prettier than 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.870
 that other issue that everyone likes 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.220
 that one had to sign that I 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.640

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.039
 never Olympic was a little hard to find 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.870
 and I got crazy behind the selection of 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.669
 miserable in two volumes when I saw a 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.680

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.449

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.270

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.310
 Funny is a lot of fun. 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.750

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.870
