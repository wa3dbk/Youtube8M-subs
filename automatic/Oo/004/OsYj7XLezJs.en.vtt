00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.500
 Skin is just not paper and 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.760
 tattoo laser print paper 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.259
 if that changes well on hit 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.309
 not really, but it's done 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.170
 many say they practice too 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 Pig skin you can do that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.250
 I also tried 12 times is quite good 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.230
 maybe such a feeling for the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 but to get machine handling is but 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 in no way comparable to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 human skin wise of the structure 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.070
 just a lot firmer and not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.500
 you live more then practice good 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 friends themselves and hopes that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 his friends later also his 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 friends are meanwhile it is like that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.149
 from the templates map so seeks 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 good as no human being at some point 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.110
 everyone comes with their own 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 imagination is already drawing 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.809
 already a big ride from the whole 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 tattooing is history yes 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.360
 Really only in the end to implement that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.850
 then rather the drawing is before 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 of course, a huge part you 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 somehow you have to get older 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 the customer is the one with his first goal 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 I came 81 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 who wanted a rose on the breast the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 he as a teenager times in a movie 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.180
 I saw original in the cinema 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.170
 very impressive and the youngest 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 Customers like to do so at the age of ten 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.750
 of course not so tattooed 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.990
 Under 18 there is nothing at all a young man 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 I'm almost completely 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.530
 collapsed but I could do it 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.670
 on the line but was after 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.650
 ten minutes too good 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.650
 glass of water is then mostly here 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:46.049
 at the tattoo convention frankfurt are 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.180
 we have been doing it since 2005 it is always 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.070
 very stressful because it is very 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.909
 is very loud and a lot of it 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.829
 people and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.819
 The space is very cramped 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.819
 and of course it is one too 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.060
 presentation purposes advertising purpose man 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.060
 just turns my potential 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.729
 Scouting before the one 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.369
 time is power that in the end one 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.679
 job wlan this is not like many 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.599
 People imagine that all 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.250
 night party do a bit 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.670
 tattoo and party again in the evening 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.950
 do 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.180
 one has backache one has in the evening 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.269
 wrist pain when it is very stupid 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.670
 the eye tour runs after some 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.099
 hours already hurt such a dream job 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 yes it's a nice job but season 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.690
 hard profession so it is not an easy one 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.690
 history
