I'm<00:01:16.439> sorry<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.950> said<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I'm sorry I said it

but<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.939> aren't<00:01:18.090> dumb<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
but they aren't dumb is how what is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
learn and remember complex tasks like

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.929 
learn and remember complex tasks like

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
this after a while you found out that

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.790 
this after a while you found out that
one<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.000> your<00:01:53.180> arms<00:01:53.420> was<00:01:53.600> an<00:01:53.690> act<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.440> would

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
one of your arms was an act that would

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.030 
one of your arms was an act that would
suck<00:01:55.100> these<00:01:55.640> arms<00:01:56.150> are<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:56.660> capable<00:01:57.290> that<00:01:57.500> even

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
suck these arms are so capable that even

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.070 
suck these arms are so capable that even

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
when they are severed they will continue

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.950 
when they are severed they will continue
to<00:02:00.260> search<00:02:00.680> for<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.220> capture<00:02:01.790> food<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.630> then

this which is my favorite some

wonder<00:03:44.120> why

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
wonder why

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.970 
wonder why

they can walk octopuses can even move on

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.820 
they can walk octopuses can even move on
land<00:03:50.250> quite<00:03:50.970> effectively<00:03:51.450> yes<00:03:52.200> they<00:03:52.590> get<00:03:52.800> a

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
land quite effectively yes they get a
