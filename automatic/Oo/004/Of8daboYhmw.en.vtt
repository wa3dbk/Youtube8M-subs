I<00:00:00.890> thought<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.100> snail's<00:00:02.399> pace<00:00:02.520> was<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.300> to

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I thought that snail's pace was going to

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.880 
I thought that snail's pace was going to
be<00:00:03.449> firing<00:00:03.689> on<00:00:03.870> all<00:00:03.929> cylinders<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.529> week<00:00:04.710> and

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
be firing on all cylinders this week and

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.110 
be firing on all cylinders this week and
we<00:00:04.950> really<00:00:05.190> are<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.549> see<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> taste<00:00:05.970> of

February the big problem is we've got
this<00:00:23.490> weather<00:00:23.699> system<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.449> brought

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this weather system now which is brought

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.910 
this weather system now which is brought
some<00:00:24.810> rain<00:00:24.960> across<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> country<00:00:25.619> during<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
some rain across the country during the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
some rain across the country during the
night<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.640> didn't<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.939> moving<00:00:27.210> southward<00:00:27.750> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
night it didn't be moving southward so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.540 
night it didn't be moving southward so
far<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:28.560> probably<00:00:28.890> pushing<00:00:29.070> backwards

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
far and then probably pushing backwards

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
far and then probably pushing backwards
again<00:00:29.789> back<00:00:30.269> north<00:00:30.510> again<00:00:30.660> during<00:00:31.140> Tuesday

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
again back north again during Tuesday

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.860 
again back north again during Tuesday
into<00:00:31.920> Wednesday<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.579> heavy<00:00:33.120> rains<00:00:33.390> connected

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
into Wednesday the heavy rains connected

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.450 
into Wednesday the heavy rains connected
to<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> course<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> pushes<00:00:35.340> away

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to it of course but if it pushes away

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.430 
to it of course but if it pushes away
way<00:00:36.030> way<00:00:36.059> north<00:00:36.540> again<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> second<00:00:37.380> half

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
way way north again for the second half

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
way way north again for the second half
of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> week<00:00:37.800> we'll<00:00:38.219> keep<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.520> feeding<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
of the week we'll keep on feeding in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.760 
of the week we'll keep on feeding in
these<00:00:39.149> 30<00:00:39.420> miles<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.230> quite<00:00:40.410> strong

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
these 30 miles but quite strong

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.319 
these 30 miles but quite strong
southerly<00:00:41.250> winds<00:00:41.520> across<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> entire

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
southerly winds across the entire

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
southerly winds across the entire
country<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> chart<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
country I think that chart there is

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
country I think that chart there is
really<00:00:44.340> open<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> question<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> lot<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.360> detail

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
really open to question a lot of detail

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.569 
really open to question a lot of detail
so<00:00:46.260> fillion<00:00:46.620> before<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> Friday

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so fillion before we get to Friday

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.400 
so fillion before we get to Friday
having<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> system<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.539> well<00:00:48.719> say<00:00:48.989> we're

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
having that system there well say we're

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.660 
having that system there well say we're
to<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> west<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> country<00:00:50.129> keeping<00:00:50.579> those

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to the west of the country keeping those

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
to the west of the country keeping those
mild<00:00:50.940> conditions<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> way

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
mild conditions going right the way

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
mild conditions going right the way
through<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> weekend<00:00:53.600> now<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.750> put

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
through to the weekend now let's put

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
through to the weekend now let's put
this<00:00:54.960> marvelous<00:00:55.500> into<00:00:56.070> context<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.910> if

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this marvelous into context because if

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.189 
this marvelous into context because if
you<00:00:57.210> bear<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.510> mind<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.020> see

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you bear in mind that we could see

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
you bear in mind that we could see
temperatures<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.710> 16<00:00:59.100> degrees<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> Murray
