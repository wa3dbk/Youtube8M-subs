00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
in lesson two we're going to actually

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.560 
in lesson two we're going to actually
start<00:00:02.159> doing<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.700> little<00:00:03.030> more<00:00:03.240> complicated

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
start doing a little more complicated

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.050 
start doing a little more complicated
work<00:00:03.929> with<00:00:04.110> our<00:00:04.230> left<00:00:04.440> hand<00:00:04.710> here<00:00:04.980> so<00:00:05.609> look<00:00:05.970> at

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
work with our left hand here so look at

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.490 
work with our left hand here so look at
the<00:00:06.150> tablature<00:00:06.509> here<00:00:06.779> you'll<00:00:07.049> notice<00:00:07.170> it's

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the tablature here you'll notice it's

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.459 
the tablature here you'll notice it's
still<00:00:07.710> very<00:00:07.859> simple<00:00:08.370> very<00:00:08.550> basic<00:00:09.290> first<00:00:10.290> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
still very simple very basic first and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.470 
still very simple very basic first and
third<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.860> then<00:00:11.070> second<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.639> fourth<00:00:14.480> we're

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
third and then second and fourth we're

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.950 
third and then second and fourth we're
gonna<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> pattern<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.230> this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.900 

March<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.429> neck

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.450 

so<00:00:31.810> let's<00:00:31.990> do<00:00:32.259> that<00:00:32.410> basic<00:00:32.829> shape<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.280> we're

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
so let's do that basic shape and we're

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.979 
so let's do that basic shape and we're
working<00:00:33.730> on<00:00:33.880> keeping<00:00:34.360> an<00:00:34.420> alternate<00:00:34.840> picking

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
working on keeping an alternate picking

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.010 
working on keeping an alternate picking
very<00:00:35.770> strict<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.430> very<00:00:36.460> even<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.480> let's<00:00:37.840> do

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
very strict and very even so let's do

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.740 
very strict and very even so let's do
that<00:00:38.200> with<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.500> metronome<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:40.540> two<00:00:40.930> three<00:00:41.410> four

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.540 

and<00:00:46.870> then

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.340 

so<00:00:53.149> I'm<00:00:53.210> just<00:00:53.360> marching<00:00:53.719> that<00:00:53.809> up<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.050> neck<00:00:54.200> as

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
so I'm just marching that up the neck as

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.260 
so I'm just marching that up the neck as
we<00:00:54.500> go<00:00:54.680> let's<00:00:55.190> move<00:00:55.309> two<00:00:55.489> hundred<00:00:55.760> sixty<00:00:55.969> beats

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
we go let's move two hundred sixty beats

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:08.649 
we go let's move two hundred sixty beats
a<00:00:56.420> minute<00:00:57.010> one<00:00:58.010> two<00:00:58.430> three<00:00:58.820> four

basically run that up and down the neck
on<00:03:10.310> all<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.209> strings<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.930> will<00:03:12.049> really

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
on all the strings and it will really

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.030 
on all the strings and it will really
start<00:03:12.590> your<00:03:13.280> hand<00:03:13.610> getting<00:03:13.909> used<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.510> playing

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
start your hand getting used to playing

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.399 
start your hand getting used to playing
alternate<00:03:16.040> picking<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.549> doing<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.940> at<00:03:17.090> speed

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
alternate picking and doing it at speed

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.149 
alternate picking and doing it at speed
consistently<00:03:18.409> and<00:03:18.620> that's<00:03:18.950> what<00:03:19.040> we're

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
consistently and that's what we're

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.269 
consistently and that's what we're
trying<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.580> here<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:19.879> practice<00:03:20.239> that
