00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.970
 you identify easily and if the 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.200
 product sold on the internet is 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.750
 forged 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.970
 Because it's really close, there's a lot of 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.559
 people taking cat by hare 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.230
 in Rio Grande do Sul a boy was 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.840
 cheated when buying glasses but solved 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.760
 not leave it alone and demanded 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.850
 rights in justice 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.939
 it is common to find on the streets or in fairs 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.630
 the sale of counterfeit goods bags 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.940
 glasses cds dvds and many others but the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.100
 commercialization of these exclusive pieces 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.809
 in addition to crime, undermines the right 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.880
 copyright 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.230
 resellers and, in particular, 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.780
 consumers where I do not buy what 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.010
 purchase a few days later does not 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.690
 is there repair 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.030
 I think those cross the product 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.579
 counterfeit products are also 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.530
 sold on the internet and in this case is 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.410
 more difficult to identify the authenticity 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.320
 was Vitor Meira with the internet itself and 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.969
 from the question of exchange a bureaucracy to do 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.149
 the same one in very friend for the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.179
 indicator is healthy broken from the lonely era 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.219
 of exchange sites did not have icca time 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.139
 a cloth with the product is in effect 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.060
 see if you see there is no qualification 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:16.599
 positive negative can make the purchase 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.759
 safe 

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:21.549
 but if the consumer is cheated 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.579
 despite all the care to get the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.799
 object thinking it is original but owns 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.959
 of an optics explains that glasses by 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.109
 example it is difficult to recognize the 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:34.299
 forgery when sold on the internet 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.380
 in this case it alerts the value 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.689
 offered 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.450
 we know when when this 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.740
 price ratio is quite attractive and 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.349
 reality 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.299
 something is not quite right then 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:48.429
 we take the case of products that are 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.029
 manufactured with unsuitable materials 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.529
 that cause allergy in contact with the 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:55.749
 face skin 

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:57.729
 we see cases of lenses with 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.069
 distortions 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.219
 only a series of factors that can 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.109
 cause to harm the person being 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.789
 user of this type of product 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.610
 a guy in the south river bought 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.950
 glasses similar to these on a website of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.300
 collective purchase but only noticed the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.940
 fake when there 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.670
 the amendment reached an award proved the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.590
 the consumer sought justice and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.680
 now the store will have to indemnify the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.370
 client for moral damages and still send 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.870
 the original product and a maximum of 30 days 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.970
 the decision came from the court of justice 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.800
 the gaucho because he understood that the customer was 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.470
 victim of stellation 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.570
 if the determination is breached the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.400
 establishment may pay a fine 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.460
 daily rate of 100 reais 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 when the consumer buys the ball 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.530
 product of a professional supplier or 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.660
 from a legal person 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.550
 established that makes the sale with 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.760
 that is, it has a structure 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.500
 of a website only to promote this type of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.510
 sale is a consumption relation 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.460
 when the consumption ratio code 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.830
 consumer protection brings in a series 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.930
 rules that support the consumer 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.730
 when the purchase is made by an individual 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.110
 that is, a natural person or not 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.490
 farms in a professional way he does not 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.390
 have this protection in the defense code of the 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.700
 consumer 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.920
 he has the right to complain has the right 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.810
 to ask for reimbursement of losses but 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.170
 through the general rules of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.170
 civil
