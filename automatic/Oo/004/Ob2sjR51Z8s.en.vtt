00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
changes so that we can eat normally and

changes so that we can eat normally and
healthfully<00:02:38.859> we<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:39.609> pitch<00:02:39.939> all<00:02:40.209> these

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
science fair projects and we could

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.229 
science fair projects and we could
really<00:02:42.730> make<00:02:43.470> significant<00:02:44.549> dents<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:45.909> what

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
really make significant dents in what

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.110 
really make significant dents in what
currently<00:02:47.109> is<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.680> real<00:02:48.129> mess<00:02:48.459> out<00:02:48.639> there<00:02:48.700> when

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
currently is a real mess out there when

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.970 
currently is a real mess out there when
it<00:02:49.209> comes<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.709> nutrition<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.799> physical

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
it comes to nutrition and physical

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.659 
it comes to nutrition and physical
activity<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:51.909> people<00:02:52.109> so<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.500> believe<00:02:54.310> that

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
activity for people so I believe that

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.649 
activity for people so I believe that
the<00:02:54.970> future<00:02:55.290> could<00:02:56.290> be<00:02:56.650> very<00:02:57.639> very<00:02:57.939> positive

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
the future could be very very positive

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.729 
the future could be very very positive
if<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.739> get<00:02:59.950> enough<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.669> a<00:03:00.760> groundswell<00:03:01.629> in<00:03:02.139> the

so it's never too late and you are

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.969 
so it's never too late and you are
extremely<00:04:00.939> powerful<00:04:01.599> because<00:04:02.169> every<00:04:02.590> thought

extremely powerful because every thought
you<00:04:03.009> have<00:04:03.269> every<00:04:04.269> mouthful<00:04:04.900> every<00:04:05.650> step

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you have every mouthful every step

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.960 
you have every mouthful every step
alters<00:04:07.180> your<00:04:07.479> gene<00:04:07.810> expression<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.970> changes

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
alters your gene expression and changes

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.989 
alters your gene expression and changes
