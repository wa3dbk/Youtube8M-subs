00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.840
 time 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.440
 Further we start we install this

 ate center last yet i want attention 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.110
 I want to say that when I installed 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.670
 I personally, I did not put the keys which 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.050
 offered without but in the process here 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.509
 installation of the installation of some programs 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.119
 from his 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:51.259
 For example, I put the necessary approach 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.700
 then this new key is at the end now 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.100
 all that all procedures slipped 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.100
 go here on this tab 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.159
 and we see these windows 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.050
 and maintain online synchronization here 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.080
 click perform 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.180
 raindance tasks then again agree 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.900
 and until it ends with us 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:27.650
 Next, click the check mark and see our 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:31.180
 licenses are actually all licenses 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.220
 when we see the full sims clubs 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.220
 here are all of our own 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.900
 here we can control this in the center 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.000
 look down 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 and before you run the bass program 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.170
 we go here on this license 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.280
 US assets 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.830
 and we hammer we hammer in our code which 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.349
 It is given on the leaves in the box exactly 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.720
 for a cube with all and a half if we 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.480
 scored all right loyalty that's in it 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.780
 lower window we will see 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.260

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.810
 key assets it license activate 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.440
 license 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.450
 it connects syncs because 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.180
 banishes everything then check again and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.299
 then we all go out, that is, we will have 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.319
 finished 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:40.060
 activated license can see 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.510
 Now of course nothing to go astray 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.510
 the program 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.970
 here we see 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:54.200

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.129
 Well, that's all loaded that is here 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.930
 we can already see the program itself but it 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.870
 a separate lesson 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.770
 and also activate further for all 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.190
 but according to the same scheme here 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.190
 pattern 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.340
 activate all our other products 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.940
 And I want to say that the flash drive is no longer 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.520
 We take out, too, as a single whole with 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.680
 Cubase programs without a flash drive 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.440
 the program doesn't work yet nice 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.319
 news 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.870
 versions are available as 32 digits so 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:05:00.729
 and at 64 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:01.570
 i set to 30 32 digits version here 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.570
 that's all 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.389

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.050
