00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to the bobbin spindle okay so you push

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.170 
to the bobbin spindle okay so you push
your<00:01:16.080> bobbin<00:01:16.970> down<00:01:17.970> onto<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> spindle<00:01:18.720> and

your bobbin down onto the spindle and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
your bobbin down onto the spindle and
and<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> should<00:01:21.479> pull<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.200> over<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.310> right

now this machine automatically

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
now this machine automatically
disengages<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> stops<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> needle<00:01:29.909> from
