going to be close enough to have it

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940 
going to be close enough to have it
actually<00:00:41.850> work<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> mid-range<00:00:42.930> isn't<00:00:43.829> too

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
on with that Magnum Magnum for the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.230 
on with that Magnum Magnum for the
secondary<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.490> Magnum<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.580> strong<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
secondary because Magnum is strong in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
secondary because Magnum is strong in
the<00:01:18.509> shoots<00:01:18.750> fast<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.320> might<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.710> as

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the shoots fast it might not have as

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
the shoots fast it might not have as
many<00:01:20.040> shots<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> boat<00:01:20.790> shot<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.720> both<00:01:22.470> shot

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
many shots the boat shot but both shot

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.390 
many shots the boat shot but both shot
isn't<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.280> good<00:01:24.240> um<00:01:24.950> it's<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:25.979> strong

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
isn't that good um it's not strong

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
isn't that good um it's not strong
that's<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> mean<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.930> charge<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.200> up

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that's what I mean you can charge it up

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.630 
that's what I mean you can charge it up
and<00:01:28.500> shoot<00:01:28.619> someone<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> lot

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and shoot someone and it will take a lot

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
and shoot someone and it will take a lot
of<00:01:29.700> their<00:01:29.850> damage<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.390> health<00:01:30.720> deal<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.229> yeah

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of their damage or health deal but yeah

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
of their damage or health deal but yeah
plasma<00:01:32.729> pistol<00:01:33.329> maybe<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:33.960> vehicle

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
plasma pistol maybe if there's vehicle

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130 
plasma pistol maybe if there's vehicle
maps<00:01:34.619> um<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.150> than<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.780> would<00:01:36.960> I'd

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
maps um but other than that I would I'd

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.719 
maps um but other than that I would I'd
stay<00:01:37.350> away<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
stay away from it because when you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
stay away from it because when you
charge<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> noob

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
charge it in but you can do the noob

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.050 
charge it in but you can do the noob
combo<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.310> need<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> from

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
combo if I need to know that is from

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.319 
combo if I need to know that is from
Halo<00:01:42.240> 2<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:43.170> charge<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.030> can't

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
Halo 2 you charge it in but you can't

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.030 
Halo 2 you charge it in but you can't
hold<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.750> too<00:01:45.930> long<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
hold it in too long because it it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.950 
hold it in too long because it it
depletes<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> energy<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.420> quick<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.409> Magnum

work<00:04:06.280> too<00:04:06.489> well<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:06.820> wouldn't<00:04:07.239> use<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.480> easy

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310

probably everyone I've seen use it
doesn't<00:04:10.810> do<00:04:11.470> good<00:04:11.760> maybe<00:04:12.760> they're<00:04:12.940> just<00:04:13.030> bad

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239

players all those centuries somewhat

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.949 
players all those centuries somewhat
good<00:04:15.190> you<00:04:15.850> can<00:04:15.970> use<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.120> for<00:04:16.299> objective<00:04:16.720> play

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
good you can use it for objective play

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.390 
good you can use it for objective play
but<00:04:17.260> other<00:04:17.410> than<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.769> wouldn't<00:04:18.190> use<00:04:18.370> it

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
but other than that I wouldn't use it

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.340 
but other than that I wouldn't use it
because<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.299> get<00:04:19.510> killed<00:04:19.870> easily

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
because it can get killed easily

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.760 
because it can get killed easily
regeneration<00:04:21.100> field<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.549> also<00:04:21.910> good<00:04:22.090> because

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
regeneration field is also good because

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.340 
regeneration field is also good because

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
quickly regenerate use this it's pretty

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.240 
quickly regenerate use this it's pretty
much<00:04:28.950> like<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.190> little<00:04:29.460> regen<00:04:29.880> thing<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.330> Halo<00:04:30.690> 3

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250

Promethean<00:04:36.540> vision<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.960> what<00:04:37.110> i<00:04:37.140> would<00:04:37.380> go

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
Promethean vision is what i would go

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.710 
Promethean vision is what i would go
with<00:04:37.700> test<00:04:38.700> them<00:04:38.760> all<00:04:38.880> out<00:04:39.060> play<00:04:39.420> with<00:04:39.600> them

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
with test them all out play with them

your choice shielding it is definitely

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.760 
your choice shielding it is definitely
the<00:04:44.970> best<00:04:45.180> choice<00:04:45.570> for<00:04:45.600> tactical<00:04:46.440> baggage

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
the best choice for tactical baggage

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.620 
the best choice for tactical baggage
because<00:04:46.950> your<00:04:47.550> shields<00:04:47.910> go<00:04:48.030> up<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.480> much

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
because your shields go up so much

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.180 
because your shields go up so much
quicker<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.200> get<00:04:49.320> hurt<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.800> there's

much<00:05:04.860> um<00:05:05.670> you<00:05:06.030> don't<00:05:06.210> need<00:05:06.330> grenades<00:05:06.570> as<00:05:07.110> much

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
much um you don't need grenades as much

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.400 
much um you don't need grenades as much
as<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.880> like<00:05:08.880> asthma<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.660> need<00:05:09.900> your<00:05:10.170> shield

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
you could use this but still shielding

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.880 
you could use this but still shielding
is<00:05:16.500> gonna<00:05:17.190> Trump<00:05:17.550> Trump<00:05:18.120> this<00:05:18.890> grenade

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
i said already firepower up you can use

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.270 
i said already firepower up you can use
like<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.110> assault<00:05:25.350> rifle<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.860> DMR

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
like the assault rifle in the DMR

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.460 
like the assault rifle in the DMR
something<00:05:26.730> but<00:05:27.090> it's<00:05:27.660> like<00:05:27.810> overkill<00:05:28.290> i

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
something but it's like overkill i

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.660 
something but it's like overkill i
wouldn't<00:05:28.800> use<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:30.240> support<00:05:30.630> upgrade

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
wouldn't use it and support upgrade

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.940 
wouldn't use it and support upgrade
dexterity<00:05:32.670> um<00:05:33.320> reason<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.380> do<00:05:34.500> this<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.680> because

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
dexterity um reason I do this is because

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.650 
dexterity um reason I do this is because
a<00:05:35.130> lot<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> guns<00:05:35.760> take<00:05:35.970> quite<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.420> long<00:05:36.510> time

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
a lot of the guns take quite a long time

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.710 
a lot of the guns take quite a long time
to<00:05:36.990> reload<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.730> in<00:05:38.730> combination<00:05:39.150> with<00:05:39.540> the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
to reload and in combination with the

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.520 
to reload and in combination with the
shielding<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:41.210> Promethean<00:05:42.210> vision<00:05:42.540> if<00:05:42.720> you

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
shielding and Promethean vision if you

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.700 
shielding and Promethean vision if you
if<00:05:43.800> I<00:05:43.890> kill<00:05:44.130> one<00:05:44.310> person<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.880> can<00:05:45.630> um<00:05:45.990> use

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
if I kill one person I can um use

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.410 
if I kill one person I can um use
Promethean<00:05:47.220> vision<00:05:47.460> see<00:05:47.760> when<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.060> second

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
Promethean vision see when the second

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.760 
Promethean vision see when the second
person<00:05:48.510> is<00:05:48.750> coming<00:05:49.080> my<00:05:49.380> shield<00:05:49.650> is

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
person is coming my shield is

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.410 
person is coming my shield is
regenerating<00:05:50.670> and<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:51.000> can<00:05:51.150> hurry<00:05:51.270> up<00:05:51.300> and

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
regenerating and I can hurry up and

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.600 
regenerating and I can hurry up and
reload<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.110> switch<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.470> another<00:05:52.800> weapon<00:05:53.340> if<00:05:53.520> I

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
reload and switch to another weapon if I

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.610 
reload and switch to another weapon if I
have<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:53.970> it's<00:05:54.510> really<00:05:54.780> great<00:05:55.020> in<00:05:55.170> combination

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
have to it's really great in combination

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.420 
have to it's really great in combination
with<00:05:55.650> them<00:05:55.860> but<00:05:56.460> um<00:05:57.350> it's<00:05:58.350> like<00:05:58.440> hard<00:05:58.890> line<00:05:59.100> you

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
with them but um it's like hard line you

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.550 
with them but um it's like hard line you
pretty<00:06:00.360> much<00:06:00.450> can<00:06:00.720> get<00:06:00.840> your<00:06:00.990> ordnance<00:06:01.320> streak

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
pretty much can get your ordnance streak

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.190 
pretty much can get your ordnance streak
whatever<00:06:02.430> faster<00:06:03.650> ammo<00:06:04.650> yeah<00:06:05.340> but<00:06:05.820> I<00:06:06.200> think

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
whatever faster ammo yeah but I think

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.770 
whatever faster ammo yeah but I think
dexterity<00:06:07.680> is<00:06:07.830> better<00:06:08.130> than<00:06:08.310> ammo<00:06:08.640> but<00:06:08.970> mo<00:06:09.600> is

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
dexterity is better than ammo but mo is

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.570 
dexterity is better than ammo but mo is
a<00:06:09.810> good<00:06:10.080> one<00:06:10.230> if<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.650> want<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:10.950> use<00:06:11.100> that<00:06:11.310> if

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
a good one if you want to use that if

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.520 
a good one if you want to use that if
you<00:06:12.180> don't<00:06:12.270> like<00:06:12.450> dexterity<00:06:13.020> it's<00:06:13.350> like

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
you don't like dexterity it's like

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.990 
you don't like dexterity it's like
dexterity<00:06:14.160> sleight<00:06:14.430> of<00:06:14.460> hand<00:06:14.670> everyone's

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
dexterity sleight of hand everyone's

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.100 
dexterity sleight of hand everyone's
like<00:06:15.390> a<00:06:15.420> fan<00:06:16.040> censor<00:06:17.040> censor<00:06:18.030> increases<00:06:18.690> so

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
like a fan censor censor increases so

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.170 
like a fan censor censor increases so
you<00:06:19.170> see<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.470> little<00:06:19.680> bit<00:06:19.830> farther<00:06:20.100> in<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.970> I

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
you see a little bit farther in the I

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.570 
you see a little bit farther in the I
haven't<00:06:21.480> used<00:06:21.600> this<00:06:21.750> by<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.110> way<00:06:22.370> but<00:06:23.370> the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
haven't used this by the way but the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.040 
haven't used this by the way but the
motion<00:06:23.970> sensor<00:06:24.210> at<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.360> bottom<00:06:24.600> left<00:06:24.750> you'll

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
motion sensor at the bottom left you'll

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.500 
motion sensor at the bottom left you'll
see<00:06:25.140> farther<00:06:25.710> ahead<00:06:26.040> and<00:06:26.400> stuff<00:06:27.330> like<00:06:27.450> that

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
see farther ahead and stuff like that

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.240 
see farther ahead and stuff like that
and<00:06:27.660> so<00:06:27.900> I<00:06:27.930> think<00:06:27.990> instead<00:06:28.350> of<00:06:28.470> like<00:06:28.590> 10<00:06:28.920> meters

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
and so I think instead of like 10 meters

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.080 
and so I think instead of like 10 meters
or<00:06:29.400> whatever<00:06:29.640> at<00:06:29.760> five<00:06:29.940> meters<00:06:30.120> it's

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
or whatever at five meters it's

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.300 
or whatever at five meters it's
five<00:06:31.389> more<00:06:31.660> meters<00:06:31.930> or<00:06:32.139> whatever<00:06:32.410> awareness

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
five more meters or whatever awareness

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.330 
five more meters or whatever awareness
is<00:06:33.900> when<00:06:34.900> your<00:06:35.050> scope<00:06:35.350> tin<00:06:35.620> or<00:06:35.889> whatever<00:06:36.160> when

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
is when your scope tin or whatever when

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.980 
is when your scope tin or whatever when
you<00:06:36.370> click<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.699> right<00:06:36.850> to<00:06:37.090> stick<00:06:37.330> or<00:06:37.480> the<00:06:37.570> LT

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
you click the right to stick or the LT

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.050 
you click the right to stick or the LT
or<00:06:38.080> whatever<00:06:38.320> your<00:06:38.560> button<00:06:39.130> is<00:06:39.280> you'll<00:06:39.790> still

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
or whatever your button is you'll still

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.469 
or whatever your button is you'll still
see<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.360> motion<00:06:40.750> sensor<00:06:41.100> decent<00:06:42.100> but<00:06:42.479> you're

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 
see the motion sensor decent but you're

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.719 
see the motion sensor decent but you're
not<00:06:43.540> gonna<00:06:43.660> be<00:06:43.780> scooped<00:06:44.020> in<00:06:44.139> that<00:06:44.229> long<00:06:44.350> and<00:06:44.729> um

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
not gonna be scooped in that long and um

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:53.060 
not gonna be scooped in that long and um
I<00:06:49.919> haven't<00:06:50.919> so<00:06:51.250> did<00:06:51.460> this<00:06:51.610> one<00:06:51.790> actually<00:06:51.940> but<00:06:52.449> I

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
I haven't so did this one actually but I

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.189 
I haven't so did this one actually but I
would<00:06:54.070> use<00:06:54.340> it<00:06:54.490> because<00:06:54.639> it<00:06:54.970> you'll<00:06:55.600> get<00:06:55.900> like

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
would use it because it you'll get like

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.510 
would use it because it you'll get like
with<00:06:56.380> a<00:06:56.410> frag<00:06:56.680> grenade<00:06:56.949> like<00:06:57.100> I<00:06:57.190> was<00:06:57.280> talking

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
with a frag grenade like I was talking

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.180 
with a frag grenade like I was talking
about<00:06:57.580> you<00:06:58.060> can<00:06:58.300> it'll<00:06:59.139> throw<00:06:59.530> even<00:06:59.800> if<00:07:00.010> they

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
about you can it'll throw even if they

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.860 
about you can it'll throw even if they
can<00:07:00.430> run<00:07:00.550> away<00:07:00.699> or<00:07:00.820> with<00:07:01.300> the<00:07:01.389> pulse<00:07:01.570> grenade

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
can run away or with the pulse grenade

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.180 
can run away or with the pulse grenade
you'll<00:07:02.290> be<00:07:02.440> able<00:07:02.500> to<00:07:02.760> work<00:07:03.760> with<00:07:04.060> that<00:07:04.090> and

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
you'll be able to work with that and

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.980 
you'll be able to work with that and
when<00:07:06.190> you<00:07:06.220> get<00:07:06.490> hit<00:07:06.669> with<00:07:06.820> a<00:07:06.850> grenade<00:07:07.060> you're

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
when you get hit with a grenade you're

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.600 
when you get hit with a grenade you're
going<00:07:08.200> to<00:07:08.260> be<00:07:08.440> able<00:07:08.470> to<00:07:08.710> stop<00:07:08.889> asad<00:07:08.919> use<00:07:09.460> either

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
going to be able to stop asad use either

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.520 
going to be able to stop asad use either
explosives<00:07:10.300> or<00:07:10.450> dexterity<00:07:10.960> what<00:07:11.350> are<00:07:11.440> these

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
explosives or dexterity what are these
