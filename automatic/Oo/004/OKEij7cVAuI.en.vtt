in that exact same situation before

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.500 
in that exact same situation before
berry<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:44.070> freshman<00:00:44.489> year<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> college<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.390> had

berry my freshman year of college I had

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
berry my freshman year of college I had
to<00:00:45.600> live<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> dorm<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> eat<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to live in the dorm and eat off of a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
to live in the dorm and eat off of a
meal<00:00:47.610> plan<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.719> sure<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.320> was

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
meal plan and I'm not sure which one was

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.139 
meal plan and I'm not sure which one was
worse<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.190> were<00:00:50.250> both<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.910> bad

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
worse because they were both pretty bad

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.939 
worse because they were both pretty bad
but<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.629> did<00:00:51.840> learn<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> few<00:00:52.410> things<00:00:52.469> throughout

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
but I did learn a few things throughout

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
but I did learn a few things throughout
the<00:00:53.039> whole<00:00:53.250> process<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> stay<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.449> top

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the whole process on how to stay on top

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
the whole process on how to stay on top
of<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.989> diet<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.460> one

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
of your diet because that really is one

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.069 
of your diet because that really is one
of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:57.059> important<00:00:57.510> things<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of the most important things when it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
of the most important things when it
comes<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> getting<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.800> good<00:00:58.980> physical<00:00:59.160> shape

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
comes to getting in good physical shape

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
comes to getting in good physical shape
so<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> University<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> Arkansas

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
so I was at the University of Arkansas

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.789 
so I was at the University of Arkansas
it's<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> public<00:01:03.059> university<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:04.350> were<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it's a public university so there were a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
it's a public university so there were a
lot<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.040> healthier<00:01:05.820> choices<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
lot of healthier choices but you have to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
lot of healthier choices but you have to
keep<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> mind<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.830> most<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:08.310> colleges

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
keep in mind with most of these colleges

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.490 
keep in mind with most of these colleges
they<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> feed<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.600> ton<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> people<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
they have to feed a ton of people and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.050 
they have to feed a ton of people and
they<00:01:10.740> don't<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> spend<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> money

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
they don't want to spend a lot of money

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
they don't want to spend a lot of money
on<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.390> they're<00:01:13.020> obviously<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.770> try

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
on it so they're obviously going to try

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.200 
on it so they're obviously going to try
to<00:01:14.100> spend<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> least<00:01:14.700> amount<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.150> money

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to spend the least amount of money

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.660 
to spend the least amount of money
possible<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.470> usually<00:01:16.680> means<00:01:16.920> really

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
possible and that usually means really

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.850 
possible and that usually means really
low<00:01:17.880> quality<00:01:18.030> food<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:19.710> not

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
low quality food so it's probably not

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560 
low quality food so it's probably not
the<00:01:20.009> best<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:21.030> school<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> was

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the best for you now my school it was

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
the best for you now my school it was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
walked around this huge room and you got

could just kind of compare it and say
this<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.120> probably<00:02:27.450> around<00:02:27.660> eight<00:02:28.080> ounces<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and it's really pretty simple for all

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.490 
and it's really pretty simple for all
the<00:02:36.270> other<00:02:36.390> foods<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.960> fruits<00:02:37.290> and

the other foods like fruits and
vegetables<00:02:37.920> let's<00:02:38.460> just<00:02:38.670> say<00:02:38.850> for<00:02:38.910> this

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
vegetables let's just say for this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.270 
vegetables let's just say for this
example<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.900> get<00:02:39.960> an<00:02:40.110> apple<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.680> look<00:02:41.100> at<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
example you get an apple you look at the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.310 
example you get an apple you look at the
apple<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.850> pretty<00:02:42.060> big<00:02:42.240> apple<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:43.050> search

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
apple it's a pretty big apple you search

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.010 
apple it's a pretty big apple you search
one<00:02:43.800> large<00:02:44.040> apple<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:44.970> MyFitnessPal<00:02:45.750> and

one large apple in on MyFitnessPal and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.900 
one large apple in on MyFitnessPal and
then<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> add<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.160> you're<00:02:47.280> good<00:02:47.460> so

then you add that in and you're good so
that's<00:02:48.060> really<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.510> only<00:02:48.570> suggestion<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.350> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
that's really the only suggestion that I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's really the only suggestion that I
have<00:02:49.470> when<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.980> comes<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.250> tracking<00:02:50.490> your
