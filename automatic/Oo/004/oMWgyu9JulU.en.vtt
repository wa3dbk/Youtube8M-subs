00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
having some issues with the starter I've

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.919 
having some issues with the starter I've
taken<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.890> off<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.700> took<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.300> autozone

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
taken it off and we took it to autozone

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.039 
taken it off and we took it to autozone
and<00:00:10.429> they've<00:00:11.429> tested<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.150> twice<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.929> it

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
and they've tested it twice and it

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.010 
and they've tested it twice and it
passed<00:00:13.290> both<00:00:13.559> times<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.540> I've<00:00:15.540> put<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
passed both times and I've put the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.180 
passed both times and I've put the
connections<00:00:16.440> back<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.800> there<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.070> everything

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
connections back on there and everything

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
connections back on there and everything
and<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.910> clicks<00:00:18.600> rapidly<00:00:19.560> every<00:00:19.710> time<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.220> go

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and it clicks rapidly every time you go

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.310 
and it clicks rapidly every time you go
to<00:00:20.400> start<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.930> know<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
to start it I don't know if it's a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290 
to start it I don't know if it's a
connection<00:00:22.800> problem<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:23.640> something

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
connection problem or something

00:00:24.300 --> 00:01:14.150 
connection problem or something
internally<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.199> I'll<00:00:25.769> let<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> guys<00:00:26.220> hear

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.270 

all<00:01:15.160> right<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.510> have<00:01:17.080> no<00:01:17.260> idea<00:01:17.290> what<00:01:18.070> that's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
all right so I have no idea what that's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.720 
all right so I have no idea what that's
doing<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.670> don't<00:01:18.850> know<00:01:18.940> if<00:01:19.090> it's<00:01:19.530> inside<00:01:20.530> or<00:01:20.890> has

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
doing I don't know if it's inside or has

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.850 
doing I don't know if it's inside or has
something<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.150> connections<00:01:22.570> I<00:01:22.810> just<00:01:23.620> I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
something to the connections I just I

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.190 
something to the connections I just I
just<00:01:24.040> know<00:01:24.370> that<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> starter<00:01:25.390> past<00:01:26.020> it

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
just know that the starter past it

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.440 
just know that the starter past it
autozone<00:01:26.680> so<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:26.920> guess<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.460> starters<00:01:27.820> okay<00:01:28.120> it

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
autozone so I guess the starters okay it

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.600 
autozone so I guess the starters okay it
might<00:01:28.840> be<00:01:28.960> one<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.290> cables<00:01:29.680> coming<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:30.220> I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
might be one of the cables coming down I

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.640 
might be one of the cables coming down I
need<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.060> be<00:01:31.180> replaced<00:01:31.570> or<00:01:31.990> something<00:01:32.410> I'm<00:01:32.620> not

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
need to be replaced or something I'm not

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.020 
need to be replaced or something I'm not
sure<00:01:33.330> also<00:01:34.330> I'll<00:01:35.020> let<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.350> look<00:01:35.680> inside<00:01:36.100> first

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
sure also I'll let you look inside first

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.380 
sure also I'll let you look inside first
all<00:01:37.720> right<00:01:37.930> I'm<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:38.410> inside<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.220> as<00:01:40.120> you<00:01:40.240> can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
all right I'm here inside and as you can

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.080 
all right I'm here inside and as you can
see<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:41.590> battery<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.340> where<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.760> needs<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:42.970> be

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
see the battery is where it needs to be

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.490 
see the battery is where it needs to be
to<00:01:43.540> run<00:01:43.660> 12<00:01:43.930> volts<00:01:44.670> everything<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.380> I'll

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
to run 12 volts everything so so I'll

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.320 
to run 12 volts everything so so I'll
turn<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.770> off

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
turn it off

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.840 
turn it off
it<00:01:49.330> goes<00:01:49.450> back<00:01:49.570> now<00:01:49.720> let's<00:01:49.870> turn<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.080> on<00:01:50.850> it's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
it goes back now let's turn it on it's

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.700 
it goes back now let's turn it on it's
got<00:01:51.970> enough<00:01:52.150> volts<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:53.050> also<00:01:53.350> took<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
got enough volts so we also took the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.590 
got enough volts so we also took the
battery<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.160> Walmart<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.640> they<00:01:54.760> said<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.120> it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
battery to Walmart and they said that it

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.020 
battery to Walmart and they said that it
passed<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.290> so<00:01:57.160> I'm<00:01:57.520> pretty<00:01:57.670> sure<00:01:57.880> it's<00:01:58.000> not

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
passed and so I'm pretty sure it's not

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.200 
passed and so I'm pretty sure it's not
the<00:01:58.210> alternator<00:01:58.690> either<00:01:58.930> so<00:01:59.970> I'll<00:02:00.970> let<00:02:01.120> you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210
