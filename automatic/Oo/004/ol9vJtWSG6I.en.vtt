00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.769
 hello youtube with you kiwi gently and u 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.750
 girls are not taken to ask about age 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.149
 but boys can be a boy all 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.029
 equals so today we will be considered 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.920
 how many years it is clear Peter Parker 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.930
 that figure it may change as 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.970
 every author of any line has the right 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.350
 on your own vision so consider 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.680
 my reasoning is something mean 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.260
 arithmetic agreed parker also 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.360
 like our friendly neighbor spiderman 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.750
 There is already very many years the first 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.339
 his appearance happened in 1962 and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.019
 in those days, the hero is fundamentally 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.360
 different from the rest and would be 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.670
 teenager to this youth took away 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.869
 only the role of helpers so that its spider 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.659
 kind of first mover 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.089
 the very first original universe million 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.270
 spiderman peter was fifteen years old 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.820
 then in 1962 that is if simply 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.520
 add the number of years until 2014 we 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.130
 make parker as old as 67 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.320
 obviously you can't do that more than that 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.890
 marvel there is a special rule three to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.450
 to one 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.430
 when it comes to counting time 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.680
 which happens in comic books 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.659
 rulers that is for every three years in 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.479
 our time is one year old 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.970
 comic additionally there is another rule 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.400
 floating time span ie 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.890
 not always the event in the comic reflects that 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.540
 what happens in our time well then 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.790
 there is mary jane the two thousandth 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.500
 may declare that the court 90 and so 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.220
 readers always look back a little 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.320
 watching a hero in the past and so holding it 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.729
 everything in mind is trying to count spider 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.560
 age in 1962 he was 15 years old at 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.260
 the world of comics passed it turns out still 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.930
 somewhere about 17 years old we will get 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.420
 dividing 52 real year natrepal 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.570
 comic-skoy ratio turns out 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.189
 that now parkr is somewhere 32 years old 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.049
 you can't tell after his face 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.819
 return to your own body after 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:15.180
 superior end line 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.310
 but in 1997 in Spider-Man speak to 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.319
 kylo flash is whether Thompson should 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.890
 be about as much as parkra 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.480
 declares that he means 25 therefore 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.620
 Peter should be somewhere 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.879
 twenty eight starts and still can 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.310
 think about what's real 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.469
 the spider's adventures didn't begin at 62 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.180
 sixty third year since 9 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.909
 months elapsed between debut and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.209
 the remaining issues means it is necessary to consider 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.389
 since 1963, that is, comic years 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.939
 passed sixteen they are 17 well and given 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.459
 flash age to peter 27 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.560
 or even twenty-six years old and indeed 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.930
 if you recall all the events applied 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.359
 whether rules one to three to parkra in general 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.019
 the first few years it seems our time 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.120
 It went exactly in step with the comics of skim in 1965 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.950
 year parker goes to college just 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.560
 somewhere around seventeen eighteen 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.829
 then time in the comics slightly slows down 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.900
 we can say that release 29 on 121 is all 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.359
 describe the events of one or two years not 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.959
 more that is at the time of death gwen 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.450
 stacy 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.699
 he is twenty years old no more then 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.340
 begins the saga of clones in it almost 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.129
 not the most accurate timeline of all exactly two 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.739
 years, that is, at its end Peter 22 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.840
 and then all 70 time in the comics is not 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.319
 moving generally considering that college 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 parker and ends in 1978 and 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.909
 means at the time of release he is 24 not 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 more considering that college sasa 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.340
 takes about four years and that's just 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.290
 after that it is possible to use 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.139
 rule one to three from 1978 to 2014 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.680
 This is another 12 comic years that is to him 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.540
 36 but why do all this in 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.430
 principle given that they will come again 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.939
 any fleet and ramos and again 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.609
 I'll draw it 25 years old in fact I 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.049
 i'm doing nonsense and losing your time so 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.790
 as part of the incredible release 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.040
 number one spiderman this year 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.370
 Marvel said that in the universe passed 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.380
 only 13 years old that is parkra 28 that is 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.690
 marvel first declares one to rule 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.760
 three and then they themselves do not follow him 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.520
 fine 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.100
 Well, okay, but I myself talked 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.140
