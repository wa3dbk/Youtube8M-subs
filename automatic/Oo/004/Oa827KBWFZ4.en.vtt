00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.519 

we've<00:00:01.470> seen<00:00:01.710> that<00:00:01.889> man<00:00:01.950> Candis<00:00:02.580> leg<00:00:02.850> rig<00:00:03.529> is

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
we've seen that man Candis leg rig is

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.480 
we've seen that man Candis leg rig is
contained<00:00:05.129> on<00:00:05.370> layer<00:00:05.910> 2<00:00:05.999> of<00:00:06.390> his<00:00:06.539> armature

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
contained on layer 2 of his armature

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.280 
contained on layer 2 of his armature
there<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.639> can<00:00:08.820> control<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.480> feet<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
there we can control the feet and the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.299 
there we can control the feet and the
legs<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:12.000> legs<00:00:12.150> are<00:00:12.330> ik<00:00:12.480> controlled<00:00:13.309> which

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
legs the legs are ik controlled which

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.840 
legs the legs are ik controlled which
simply<00:00:14.730> means<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.710> it<00:00:16.710> has<00:00:16.770> two<00:00:17.040> ik<00:00:17.220> targets

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
simply means that it has two ik targets

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.210 
simply means that it has two ik targets
at<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> heels<00:00:18.360> and<00:00:20.480> determinate<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.780> hips

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
at the heels and determinate at the hips

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.750 
at the heels and determinate at the hips
so<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.280> you<00:00:23.400> move<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.700> torso<00:00:23.880> around<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:25.290> feet

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
so if you move the torso around the feet

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
so if you move the torso around the feet
won't<00:00:26.760> move<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.120> all<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.630> legs<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.050> spend<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
won't move at all the legs just spend to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
won't move at all the legs just spend to
accommodate<00:00:29.570> likewise<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.870> swivel<00:00:31.110> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
accommodate likewise if you swivel the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
accommodate likewise if you swivel the
hip<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:31.830> left<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.129> right<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.240> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
hip from left to right you can see that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.610 
hip from left to right you can see that
the<00:00:33.540> feeds<00:00:33.780> remain<00:00:34.260> locked<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.740> place<00:00:36.410> also<00:00:37.410> if

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the feeds remain locked in place also if

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.819 
the feeds remain locked in place also if
you<00:00:38.010> move<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> foot<00:00:38.550> somewhere<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:40.350> move

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
you move the foot somewhere it can move

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
you move the foot somewhere it can move
to<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.130> location<00:00:41.340> without<00:00:41.880> affecting<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to that location without affecting the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 
to that location without affecting the
hip<00:00:42.900> to<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> torso<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.090> stay<00:00:45.210> locked

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
hip to the torso and it will stay locked

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.970 
hip to the torso and it will stay locked
wherever<00:00:46.290> you<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> setup<00:00:49.800> for

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
wherever you put it the setup for

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.060 
wherever you put it the setup for
mankind<00:00:50.400> e<00:00:50.489> tues<00:00:50.700> ik<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.420> stretchy<00:00:51.950> so<00:00:52.950> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
mankind e tues ik is stretchy so the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.280 
mankind e tues ik is stretchy so the
legs<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:53.970> pulled<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.540> beyond<00:00:55.050> their

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
legs can be pulled out beyond their

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.150 
legs can be pulled out beyond their
normal<00:00:55.820> stretch<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> pull<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
normal stretch as you pull them out and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270 
normal stretch as you pull them out and
of<00:01:00.120> course<00:01:00.360> if<00:01:00.540> you<00:01:00.660> push<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.020> closer<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
of course if you push them closer the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.029 
of course if you push them closer the
leg<00:01:02.489> will<00:01:02.790> bend<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.450> accommodate<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.799> closer

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
leg will bend to accommodate the closer

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.069 
leg will bend to accommodate the closer
position<00:01:08.299> furthermore<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.630> look<00:01:09.810> closer

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
position furthermore let's look closer

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.309 
position furthermore let's look closer
at<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.499> legs<00:01:11.450> you'll<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> stretch

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
at the legs you'll see that the stretch

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.919 
at the legs you'll see that the stretch
is<00:01:14.100> spread<00:01:14.819> out<00:01:14.850> across<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.270> length<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
is spread out across the length of the

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.410 
is spread out across the length of the
leg<00:01:16.139> the<00:01:16.859> knee<00:01:17.069> stays<00:01:17.429> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.789> middle<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
leg the knee stays in the middle it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.879 
leg the knee stays in the middle it
doesn't<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.840> stretch<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> calf<00:01:19.649> of<00:01:19.829> the

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
doesn't just stretch the calf of the

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:24.410 
doesn't just stretch the calf of the
angle<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.819> legs<00:01:23.819> gets<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.240> little

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
angle and that the legs gets a little

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.269 
angle and that the legs gets a little
skinnier<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.499> stretch<00:01:25.709> out<00:01:27.979> now<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
skinnier as they stretch out now at the

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.309 
skinnier as they stretch out now at the
foot<00:01:29.520> you'll<00:01:30.149> see<00:01:30.389> that<00:01:30.539> you<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:31.109> more

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
foot you'll see that you have two more

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.590 
foot you'll see that you have two more
bones<00:01:31.639> first<00:01:32.639> you<00:01:32.789> see<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.149> main<00:01:33.329> bone

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
bones first you see that the main bone

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
bones first you see that the main bone
pivots<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.139> heel<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.799> character<00:01:35.279> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
pivots the heel of the character and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.660 
pivots the heel of the character and
that<00:01:35.779> makes<00:01:36.779> sense<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.409> you're<00:01:38.039> animating<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that makes sense if you're animating a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.620 
that makes sense if you're animating a
walk<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.149> run<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.719> doing<00:01:40.469> he'll<00:01:40.709> strikes<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
walk or run for doing he'll strikes and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
walk or run for doing he'll strikes and
you'll<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.319> turn<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.950> sub

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you'll see that if you turn on sub

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.330 
you'll see that if you turn on sub
Seraphia<00:01:44.999> more<00:01:45.329> clearly<00:01:45.889> so<00:01:46.889> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
Seraphia more clearly so you can do a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.730 
Seraphia more clearly so you can do a
heel<00:01:47.670> strike<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.359> then<00:01:48.450> roll<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.959> foot<00:01:49.229> over

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
heel strike and then roll the foot over

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.989 
heel strike and then roll the foot over
the<00:01:49.770> heel<00:01:50.189> pretty<00:01:50.819> easily<00:01:51.029> like<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.719> and

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
the heel pretty easily like that and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.399 
the heel pretty easily like that and
then<00:01:53.999> there's<00:01:54.149> another<00:01:54.209> pivot<00:01:54.779> here<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
then there's another pivot here at the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.409 
then there's another pivot here at the
mid<00:01:55.740> middle<00:01:56.099> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> foot<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:56.969> allows<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:57.419 
mid middle of the foot which allows you

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:59.300 
mid middle of the foot which allows you
to<00:01:57.539> push<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.899> character<00:01:58.349> up<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.889> balls<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to push the character up on the balls of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
to push the character up on the balls of
his<00:01:59.429> feet<00:01:59.539> for<00:02:00.539> instance<00:02:00.749> when<00:02:00.959> he's<00:02:01.109> stepping

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
his feet for instance when he's stepping

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.249 
his feet for instance when he's stepping
up<00:02:01.709> and<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.849> course<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.479> rotate<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> toes

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
up and of course you can rotate the toes

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.639 
up and of course you can rotate the toes
to<00:02:05.069> flap<00:02:05.310> them<00:02:05.549> around<00:02:05.819> like<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.649> more

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to flap them around like that a more

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.679 
to flap them around like that a more
complete<00:02:07.979> setup<00:02:08.399> would<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.879> another<00:02:09.209> pivot

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
complete setup would have another pivot

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.289 
complete setup would have another pivot
at<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.530> toes<00:02:10.799> so<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> character<00:02:11.879> could<00:02:12.000> send

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
at the toes so the character could send

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:12.880 
at the toes so the character could send
a<00:02:12.390> tip

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
a tip

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.690 
a tip
and<00:02:13.310> maybe<00:02:13.940> one<00:02:14.270> at<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> ankle<00:02:14.960> as<00:02:15.080> well<00:02:15.700> but

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and maybe one at the ankle as well but

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.430 
and maybe one at the ankle as well but
that<00:02:16.910> would<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.090> quite<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> few<00:02:17.810> pivots<00:02:18.170> there

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
that would be quite a few pivots there

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.860 
that would be quite a few pivots there
an<00:02:18.530> animator<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.100> keep<00:02:19.310> track<00:02:19.550> off<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.420> for

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
an animator to keep track off and for

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.540 
an animator to keep track off and for
man<00:02:21.020> candy<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.470> decided<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.069> keep<00:02:22.220> things

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
man candy I decided to keep things

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.720 
man candy I decided to keep things
simple<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.500> pivot<00:02:25.010> locations

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
simple and just have to pivot locations

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.920 
simple and just have to pivot locations
and<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:28.700> way<00:02:28.819> we<00:02:29.000> could<00:02:29.150> track<00:02:29.390> things<00:02:29.720> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and that way we could track things a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.130 
and that way we could track things a
little<00:02:30.170> bit<00:02:30.440> easier<00:02:31.100> as<00:02:31.370> animators

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.830 

you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.350> get<00:02:37.530> further<00:02:37.740> control<00:02:38.720> using<00:02:39.720> these

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
you can get further control using these

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.680 
you can get further control using these
little<00:02:40.230> balls<00:02:40.380> there's<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> caf<00:02:41.690> one

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
little balls there's one in the caf one

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.100 
little balls there's one in the caf one
of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> knee<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.260> one<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> thigh<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.960> can

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
of the knee and one in the thigh you can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.670 
of the knee and one in the thigh you can
also<00:02:46.320> control<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.830> knee<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.520> ik<00:02:48.330> by<00:02:49.170> selecting

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
also control the knee in ik by selecting

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.580 
also control the knee in ik by selecting
this<00:02:49.830> little<00:02:50.160> arc<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.440> swiveling<00:02:52.440> it

this little arc here and swiveling it
from<00:02:52.800> side<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.280> side<00:02:55.610> now<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.850> good<00:02:57.030> setup

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
from side to side now it's a good setup

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.540 
from side to side now it's a good setup
and<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.960> it's<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.320> floating<00:02:58.620> around<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.400> it

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
doesn't cause the leg to flip much but

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.540 
doesn't cause the leg to flip much but
there<00:03:03.330> are<00:03:03.480> some<00:03:03.690> extreme<00:03:04.170> locations<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:05.100> the

won't be able to control the knee

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.380 
won't be able to control the knee
however<00:03:11.220> you'll<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.060> minute<00:03:12.180> that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
however you'll see in a minute that

however you'll see in a minute that
you're<00:03:12.690> not<00:03:12.900> without<00:03:13.260> recourse<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.490> those

cases precise control of the knee you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
cases precise control of the knee you
can<00:03:18.000> select<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.960> little<00:03:19.290> ball<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
can select this little ball in the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.890 
can select this little ball in the
middle<00:03:19.800> now<00:03:20.190> by<00:03:20.340> default<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:21.030> works<00:03:21.300> only<00:03:21.570> in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
middle now by default that works only in

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.080 
middle now by default that works only in
the<00:03:22.020> plane<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.530> leg<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.060> just

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
the plane of the leg so you can just

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.790 
the plane of the leg so you can just
move<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.720> or<00:03:25.020> out<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.770> plane<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:28.620> can

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
move it in or out in that plane you can

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.700 
move it in or out in that plane you can
also<00:03:28.950> use<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.790> create<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.780> squash<00:03:31.290> effect

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
also use it to create a squash effect

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.130 
also use it to create a squash effect
instead<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.370> bent<00:03:32.580> knee<00:03:32.790> effect<00:03:33.210> when<00:03:33.990> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
instead of a bent knee effect when the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.670 
instead of a bent knee effect when the
heel<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.680> closer<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.700> torso<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:37.530> can

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
heel is closer to the torso and you can

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.860 
heel is closer to the torso and you can
also<00:03:37.860> do<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.340> bend<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.820> leg<00:03:39.030> even<00:03:39.690> when

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
also do it to bend the leg even when

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.890 
also do it to bend the leg even when
it's<00:03:40.020> stretched<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.560> its<00:03:40.740> limit<00:03:44.630> now<00:03:45.630> another

it's stretched to its limit now another

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.860 
it's stretched to its limit now another
thing<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.350> can<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.680> with<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.300> I'll<00:03:48.300> go<00:03:48.750> out

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
thing you can do with it I'll go out

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.630 
thing you can do with it I'll go out
here<00:03:49.640> now<00:03:50.640> another<00:03:50.940> thing<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.360> can<00:03:51.540> do<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.930> if

here now another thing you can do is if

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.120 
here now another thing you can do is if
you<00:03:53.640> bend<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.030> leg<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.620> you're<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.770> extreme
