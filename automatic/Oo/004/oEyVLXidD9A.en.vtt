I've<00:00:23.279> been<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.640> curious<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.359> this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539

thing<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:24.930> lift<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.410> heavy<00:00:25.740> door<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.490> know

about<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> second<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:31.309> guess<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.579> be

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
about a second I guess that would be

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.830 
about a second I guess that would be
enough<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> door<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> too<00:00:40.500> heavy<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
enough the door is too heavy for it I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.190 
enough the door is too heavy for it I

are<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.500> adjustments<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
are some adjustments on this thing so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:04.270 
what if I adjusted the upward lift I'm
still<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.539> adjustment<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:52.140> that<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280
