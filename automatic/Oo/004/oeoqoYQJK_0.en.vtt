00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 montpellier 4th of the classification was receiving 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.910
 biarritz the match ended at 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.730
 a few moments on canal + sport 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.200
 françois trillo richard dourthe the words 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.389
 and the inhabitants of Montpellier had 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.179
 golden opportunity to pick up at the trio of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.760
 head 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.930
 yes isabelle actually but the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 Montpellier were without their 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 manage their Druid Fabian galthié who 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.609
 was held in Paris and suddenly it was 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.439
 stéphane glas and mario ledesma who had 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.670
 the keys of the Montpellier house and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 the montpelliérains house game like 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 usually by igniting the stage despite 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.050
 the cold and they were messing around and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 cause faults biarrote richardot 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.059
 like here 10th minute angonia under the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 photosol pressure says yes the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.570
 Montpellier who dominated this 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.300
 first half in the possession of the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.219
 balloon but not quite to the score 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.649
 simply white paillaugue opens one 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.980
 here's a nice 40-meter penalty that has 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.180
 launched two bloggers this part 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.850
 Yachvili replied with two penalties 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 rhythms n 6 to 3.1 we cut 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.420
 lukasz in love and back 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.360
 Argentine 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 titularized tonight balshaw clears but 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.689
 we protect the Montpellier side because 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.190
 that he has returned to his name 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.890
 the soul of m yes 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.090
 yuki how mario ledesma protests 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.740
 since he led the ball into the 22 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.810
 so should have touched in the 22 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.390
 we will see that the consequence will be 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.520
 very serious for the Montpellier team 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.200
 since in the action that follows and yes 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.780
 this is the 31st minute a cons 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.820
 wonderful misfortunes harinordoquy in 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.920
 touch a beautiful pass of yachvili 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.830
 and then behind well ie volts 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.480
 baby biarrot side for bell shaw can 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.220
 to be in front anyway the audience him 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.460
 the referee sail sir lafon must 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 not a big beautiful bridge and still 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.880
 of jean pascal barraque 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.800
 and this is the test against Bérenx yes 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.960
 very beautiful and very nice test of jeans 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.550
 pascal barraque in blazing forward of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.860
 ball between benoît baby ian balshaw 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.440
 in any case the gesture of two bars at the dock 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 and very beautiful a nice test biarritz leads 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.210
 10 to 6 but it's Montpellier that makes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.600
 the forcing in the image of my sweet well 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.820
 picked up by barack the author of the essay 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 the Montpellier who grows who 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.780
 pushes and start to blame 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.240
 the biarrots faults rough dalet 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.890
 broom the Welsh winger of biarritz 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.840
 sir lafon does not hesitate yellow card 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.940
 there are two minutes left in this 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.430
 first period is so biarritz himself 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.130
 found at 14 against 15 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.050
 result 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.240
 important since mingled at five meters 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.540
 the left side of brooke d left so 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.450
 and feathers and peoples and 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.150
 rather smartly more paillogues 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.620
 early if they ask how 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.590
 a movie or ben harper it's all alone 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.090
 but the scrum half of big 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.819
 experiments and benoît paillaugue who has 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.680
 saw imanol harinordoquy h anticipate on 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.170
 the right he escaped from the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 left and score this test and it takes 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.439
 to say that benoît Paillaugue was at this 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.629
 moment there author all the points of 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.879
 his team at 10 montpellier repasse 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.079
 in front of and we are of course refrigerated 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.189
 only montpellier you saw him in the 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.390
 tribunes the little blanket a 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.470
 smile control because anyway 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.849
 biarritz has worried 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.680
 Montpellier and yet the 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.349
 Montpellier at the beginning of the second 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.040
 period well at 15 against 14 for eight 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 minutes are going to make the break is good for 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.420
 grow strong like here on this 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.220
 this action this little guide little of 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.930
 paillaugue you could have ended in 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.370
 tests the finances the wildlife has come back 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.019
 a penalty nothing was sure a 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.489
 advantage and sir lafon whistled a 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.659
 little early because he did not see the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.799
 turn his head he did not see that ian 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.720
 balshaw did not control this ball 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.290
 and leave should have been granted to 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.450
 yoann audrin 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.140
 finally it's a penalty 19 10 at this 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.790
 moment there for 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.290
 Montpellier who will continue 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.520
 continue with Irish centric 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.850
 the past Argentine may say today 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.650
 beautiful with this discount 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.050
 inside this inner hook and which 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.880
 find the sweet outside to the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.170
 in Montpellier test marker very 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.240
 good hinge today however 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.260
 paillaugue fernandez if we were at the 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.380
 maneuver to this team montpelliéraine 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.820
 and the bar that Montpellier to float 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.010
 above the Olympic biarritz 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.690
 today and nagusa only has to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.220
 run and finish this sixth action 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.840
 try for a ayew that this season the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.060
 Fijian then was the biarrots 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.310
 react with aled brew who came back 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.800
 of his penance of those ten minutes 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.200
 die both lola by taken over by the 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.510
 jersey the shorts by nagusa is 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.820
 finally fit it flattens or not no 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.900
 not forward and it's a shame for 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.459
 the biarrots because that would have allowed 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.200
 to come back a little bit in this 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.180
 party and of and raise and this one 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.920
 but unfortunately it gave them a 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.990
 extra morale shot and the 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.590
 following a decree that only domination 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.620
 Montpellier 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.510
 biarritz suffered at the end of the match biarritz 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.449
 who is trying but that's it 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.330
 pressure of the Montpellier defense 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.979
 a single rider of opportunity here again 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.819
 we will arrive on a series of scrums 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.830
 is mixed up with five 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.479
 benoît august is circumspect in the 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.129
 inviting because this series was suffering 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.819
 already guys have all along this 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.879
 second period 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.650
 in melee and it's confirmed sir 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.710
 lafon is going to give a final test on 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.189
 then plays the 73rd minute with the test of 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.749
 penalty 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.430
 maybe a little early but in any case 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:01.409
 case the cholera dominance was 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.360
 important in melee and there these sealed 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.020
 the first leg and the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.569
 biarrots hopes 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.300
 this is also benoît's wound 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.729
 august 33 to 10 for montpellier no 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.610
 offensive bonus for stéphane glas from the 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.199
 mission is fulfilled for coaches 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.639
 assistants here we were happy in the 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.539
 cloakroom of montpellier 4th victory 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.370
 consecutive all competitions 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.289
 confused to move to Toulon 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.270
 inevitably benoît paillaugue and well 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.499
 micro christophe shower me they 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.899
 were happy with this team of 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:29.370
 Montpellier who matures at he said yeah 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.110
 it's a nice win because good 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.449
 we heard that Montpellier 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.770
 was decreased compared to all these 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.089
 certainly, but there are 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.349
 quality players as cons they have 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.539
 replaced and I think it's they 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.409
 have produced present the whole team has 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.330
 answered present 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.029
 we were expecting a complicated match on 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.560
 had it been successful with their weapons more 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.180
 easy in the second half we put a 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.159
 little more applications more present in 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.360
 the ruck the balloons a little more go out 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.209
 a little faster we knew how to put 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.490
 our our game up and they finished 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:58.649
 by crack victory of montpellier on 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.149
 will enjoy having you richard a 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.459
 specialist with nourrichard doubts a 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:04.139
 word about the blues you followed as 

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:06.979
 us this new defeat of the fifteen of 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.909
 France is what you need to worry 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.389
 but inevitably you have to worry 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.219
 since two defeats during 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.199
 opening of the tournament knowing that we 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.759
 goes in ireland and england is 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.610
 not deceive the easy matches and 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.039
 especially the most complicated ones I 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.360
 believe that the French have blocked 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.729
 a little bit about the composition of equipped 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.919
 composition of the group of 23 and the 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.199
 injury of yoann huget to 2 benjamin 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.689
 never led to françois 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.310
 trinh-ducdon forgiveness in the back and that that to 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.149
 disorganize this team we felt them 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.310
 lost on the ground 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:39.810
 I hope that the blues will raise the 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.189
 head and go up we roll up 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.180
 the sleeves to hope to do 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.979
 something in ireland england 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.760
 first in ireland and then receive 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.930
 the shelled will be the hollow 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.450
 the next match at twickenham 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.220
 england france the 23 february 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.990
 recalls this defeat of the fifteenth 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.300
 france 16 to 6 facing Wales at 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:02.810
 stadium of france thank you gentlemen
