00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:04.131
(lively music)

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.610
- Hey guys, I'm Adriene.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.422
Welcome to Crazy Happy Cooking.

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.523
It's been a long day, and
I don't know about you,

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:15.603
but after a long day,

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:17.088
I just want to eat something nourishing,

00:00:17.088 --> 00:00:19.585
and good, so I got the ingredients here

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.268
for a veggie cupboard soup.

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:23.182
Let's go to the kitchen and get started.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.479
(lively music)

00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:35.107
So, today, I just picked out

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:38.011
whatever was on sale
or looked the freshest.

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.013
But you can cater your vegetable choices

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:43.701
to what looks good or
what your family likes.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.813
I'm going to begin by prepping my onion.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.471
The onion's going to be one
of our basic ingredients

00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:51.189
and it goes in first.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.852
I like to keep these kind of thin.

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.276
And if you do end up crying,

00:00:57.276 --> 00:00:58.889
maybe that's the universe just telling you

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.445
you needed a little cry.

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:03.422
I'm just going to put
this off to the side.

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:06.181
I'm going to go ahead and
get started on my garlic.

00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.462
These are two big pieces

00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:08.464
so I'm going to go with just two.

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:09.586
If you have kind of small ones,

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:11.110
then maybe you go with three or four.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.654
If you need a little extra immune boost,

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:14.803
let's go with more, right!

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:17.308
Because garlic is good for you!

00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:19.404
Oh, yeah.

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:21.535
Oh, yeah, it's been a long day,

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:22.741
smash that garlic!

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.200
Nice, small little mince of garlic here.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.953
So, my friend, Jenny Marie,

00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:33.017
first made me this soup
when I had vocal surgery.

00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:35.172
Can you imagine me not talking?

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:35.869
Me neither!

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.822
I was actually just talking
to her the other day

00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:39.563
and she told me that they
call it Adriene Soup now,

00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:42.641
and it's proof that energy and intentions

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:44.057
are real, I think.

00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:44.939
And if you cook with love,

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.564
and if you cook with
good juju, good energy,

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.199
then you can taste it!

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.000
So, I got a pot on the stove,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.747
and I'm going to put a little
bit of olive oil in my pot.

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:56.083
Just coating the pan, not too much,

00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.109
but enough to take care of
my first batch of veggies.

00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:11.607
Instantly, you're already going to impress

00:02:11.607 --> 00:02:12.931
whoever walks in your door,

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.009
whoever's in the household
with just the simple smell

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.394
(laughs) of olive oil and onion.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.521
And then, I might take a little

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:22.029
salt and pepper, pinch of each,

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.269
and a little bit of thyme.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.709
One of my favorite soup
bases is an herb mix,

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.228
you can use that "herbes de provence,"

00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:31.353
you could use a little garlic powder,

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:33.233
so we don't have to be
snobbish about this,

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.752
we can just kind of roll with the punches

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:37.448
and go with what we have.

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:38.829
And then, in time, we can grow.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.768
Just like I told my friends in yoga,

00:02:40.768 --> 00:02:42.626
we start off with something small,

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.425
like a quick Yoga For Weightloss video,

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:46.433
like we have on the Yoga
With Adriene channel,

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.174
which if you're interested you should go

00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:49.951
check out all the free
videos on Yoga With Adriene,

00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.366
and then you grow,

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:54.885
more spiritual, or just
whatever floats your boat.

00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:56.186
It's the same thing with cooking.

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:57.532
Just start wherever you are now,

00:02:57.532 --> 00:03:00.062
don't worry about if you have

00:03:00.062 --> 00:03:01.897
these certain kind of green beans.

00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:02.931
Trust yourself,

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:04.392
is what I'm trying to say!

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.627
Okay, it's time to peel some things!

00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:11.068
We all know that carrots
are good for us, yes?

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:13.634
The better to see you with.

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:17.538
You could do about a cup of these.

00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:20.529
I spotted these fresh green beans,

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.813
kind of a garden veggie soup today.

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.055
So I'm going to wash these guys,

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.760
I'm also just going to
take two stalks of celery

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.090
with me to the sink to do a quick bath.

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.333
Now it's time to put the carrots in

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.039
because these take a
little bit longer to cook,

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.160
so I'm going to toss them in
with my onions and garilc.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.093
Mmm, smells delish!

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:45.556
I wouldn't think that
green beans in a soup

00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:47.135
would be so comforting and delicious

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:49.756
but they are, they're so good!

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.992
And I'm going to peel my potatoes,

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:56.294
and I'm going to go with two,

00:03:56.294 --> 00:03:57.386
you can also skip this.

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:59.871
For me, this is like the ultimate comfort.

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:03.797
So those are my taters,

00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:04.946
I'm just going to put them aside

00:04:04.946 --> 00:04:06.275
because I'm going to pop them in later.

00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.955
And now we're really
ready to rock and roll.

00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:10.778
I'm going to peel the corn.

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:12.265
And I like to break it in half because,

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:13.564
one, it's fun,

00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:17.176
but two, I can have a
better handle on my corn.

00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.620
Oh! (laughs)

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.984
See, just like that,

00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.758
it's like a firework of corn.

00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:25.082
And now we're going to
add some liquid, alright?

00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:28.850
So, you can use freshly diced tomatoes,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.776
I'm personally okay with just using

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:32.905
diced tomatoes out of a can.

00:04:33.842 --> 00:04:36.847
Then I'm going to pop in the corn.

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.633
There's something about
working with fresh ingredients.

00:04:40.553 --> 00:04:42.595
I'm just going to take the
green beans and the celery

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:44.556
and throw them into the pot.

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:51.169
We continue by adding a
little vegetable broth.

00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:53.955
And by a little I mean a lot (laughs).

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.297
Starting to look really yummy in here.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:02.072
And now it's time for

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:05.100
the superfood, the kale.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.378
Just going to take it off the stem.

00:05:07.378 --> 00:05:08.759
Like so.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.779
I add the leafy greens because

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.880
I like the texture of it in the soup

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.987
and I also want the extra nutrients.

00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:18.836
Just thinning it a bit
so that, when you eat it,

00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:22.990
you're not stuck with a
big spaghetti-style kale.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.332
This might seem like a lot

00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:26.199
but it will cook down and I like a lot.

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:29.396
Beautiful!

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:31.323
And stir it in.

00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:34.135
Once I get everything in the pot,

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.736
I can walk away, I can put it on a simmer,

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.839
and I can go do something
that I need to do,

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.995
or go do a yoga video.

00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:43.317
So colorful, so fresh.

00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:46.718
So, let's give it a try.

00:05:50.872 --> 00:05:51.635
Mmm.

00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:55.201
It's so yummy.

00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:56.475
So tasty.

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:57.895
There's a little something
for everyone here,

00:05:57.895 --> 00:06:01.171
to make everyone in your house happy.

00:06:01.171 --> 00:06:03.178
Because this is Crazy Happy Cooking.

00:06:03.178 --> 00:06:05.322
Love you guys, thanks for watching!

00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:06.961
I'm going to enjoy this yummy soup!

00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:08.991
Take care.

00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:12.452
(lively music)
