are quite exciting so please tell me a
bit<00:00:30.480> more<00:00:30.540> yeah<00:00:30.930> absolutely<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.489> t3<00:00:32.910> supports

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
bit more yeah absolutely the t3 supports

SSDs and hard drives up to 12 terabytes

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
SSDs and hard drives up to 12 terabytes
with<00:00:36.330> a<00:00:36.360> regular<00:00:36.660> hard<00:00:37.050> drives<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.559> over

with a regular hard drives or over
terabyte<00:00:38.519> with<00:00:38.699> SSDs<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> unique

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
terabyte with SSDs but the unique

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.570 
terabyte with SSDs but the unique
function<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.769> can<00:00:40.949> actually<00:00:40.980> mix

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
function is that you can actually mix

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.240 
function is that you can actually mix
and<00:00:41.790> match<00:00:41.970> SSDs<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.720> hard<00:00:43.199> drives<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:44.070> for

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and match SSDs and hard drives so for

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.460 
and match SSDs and hard drives so for
example<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.850> could<00:00:44.970> put<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.480> SSDs<00:00:46.019> in<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.290> raid

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
example you could put two SSDs in a raid

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.220 
example you could put two SSDs in a raid
0<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.879> scratch<00:00:48.180> disk<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.199> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
0 as your scratch disk and then have a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.900 
0 as your scratch disk and then have a
full<00:00:49.530> terabyte<00:00:49.769> drive<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> bottom<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
full terabyte drive at the bottom as a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.030 
full terabyte drive at the bottom as a
backup<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.989> could<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> alternative

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
backup or you could do the alternative

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.490 
backup or you could do the alternative
which<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.239> SSD<00:00:54.719> hasn't<00:00:55.260> scratched

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
which is have one SSD hasn't scratched

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.190 
which is have one SSD hasn't scratched
it<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.950> then<00:00:56.340> had<00:00:56.489> 24<00:00:57.000> terabyte<00:00:57.420> drives<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
it and then had 24 terabyte drives you

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.260 
it and then had 24 terabyte drives you
know<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.160> mirror<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.700> data<00:01:00.030> in

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
know right one to mirror your data in

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.010 
know right one to mirror your data in
case<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.260> ever<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.160> lose<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> hard<00:01:03.030> time<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
case you are ever to lose a hard time so

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.710 
case you are ever to lose a hard time so
there's<00:01:04.860> new<00:01:05.789> products<00:01:06.300> that<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.479> come<00:01:06.660> out

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
there's new products that have come out

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
there's new products that have come out
obviously<00:01:07.289> Apple<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.740> got<00:01:07.920> their<00:01:08.130> fusion

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
obviously Apple have got their fusion

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
obviously Apple have got their fusion
drive<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.509> do<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> similar<00:01:10.020> type<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.380> thing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
drive can we do a similar type of thing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.490 
drive can we do a similar type of thing
to<00:01:10.800> speed<00:01:11.039> up<00:01:11.190> performance<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.940> this<00:01:12.500> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
to speed up performance with this you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
to speed up performance with this you
can<00:01:13.530> speed<00:01:14.160> up<00:01:14.190> performance<00:01:14.729> by<00:01:14.940> putting<00:01:15.390> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
can speed up performance by putting it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
can speed up performance by putting it
into<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.720> raid<00:01:15.869> 0<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.680> three<00:01:17.009> drives<00:01:17.250> working

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
into a raid 0 so three drives working

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.040 
into a raid 0 so three drives working
together<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:18.119> two<00:01:18.300> drives<00:01:18.600> working<00:01:18.930> together

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
together or two drives working together

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.249 
together or two drives working together
with<00:01:19.680> three<00:01:19.920> drives<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.910> a<00:01:21.030> raid<00:01:21.180> 0<00:01:21.539> with<00:01:21.750> SSDs

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
with three drives in a raid 0 with SSDs

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.839 
with three drives in a raid 0 with SSDs
you<00:01:22.410> can<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.649> over<00:01:22.920> eight<00:01:23.069> hundred<00:01:23.099> megabytes

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:23.849 
you can get over eight hundred megabytes

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.330 
you can get over eight hundred megabytes
a<00:01:23.970> second<00:01:24.330> most<00:01:24.899> companies<00:01:25.229> make<00:01:25.679> two<00:01:26.190> bay

raids<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.910> we<00:01:27.030> decided<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.509> relatively<00:01:28.050> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
raids and we decided for relatively the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
raids and we decided for relatively the
same<00:01:28.349> price<00:01:28.830> point<00:01:29.099> we<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
same price point we will make a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.900 
same price point we will make a
three-bay<00:01:30.569> rate<00:01:30.860> faster<00:01:31.860> speeds<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.550> larger

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
three-bay rate faster speeds and larger

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.520 
three-bay rate faster speeds and larger
storage<00:01:33.179> capacity<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.899> can<00:01:33.929> actually<00:01:34.140> daisy

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
storage capacity you can actually daisy

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.080 
storage capacity you can actually daisy

which<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.719> quite<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.929> lot<00:01:38.109> yes<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.549> then<00:01:39.640> again

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
which is quite a lot yes but then again

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.099 
which is quite a lot yes but then again
you're<00:01:40.090> going<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.270> get<00:01:40.390> quite<00:01:40.689> close<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
you're going to get quite close to the

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.440 
you're going to get quite close to the
Thunderbolt<00:01:41.500> speed<00:01:41.770> anyway<00:01:42.070> with<00:01:42.460> with<00:01:43.240> that

two<00:02:42.040> Thunderbolt<00:02:42.579> ports<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.299> actually<00:02:43.420> use

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.749 
two Thunderbolt ports but I actually use

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.270 
two Thunderbolt ports but I actually use
one<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.170> connect<00:02:44.439> to<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.620> internet<00:02:44.739> with

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
one to connect to the internet with

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.819 
one to connect to the internet with
connect<00:02:46.120> right<00:02:46.299> use<00:02:47.079> another<00:02:47.319> one<00:02:47.469> to<00:02:47.560> drive<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
connect right use another one to drive a

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.039 
connect right use another one to drive a
display<00:02:48.430> right<00:02:49.090> I've<00:02:49.450> got<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.599> loop<00:02:49.810> through

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
display right I've got a loop through

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.289 
display right I've got a loop through
right<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.980> by<00:02:51.280> using<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:52.030> could<00:02:52.180> actually

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
right so by using this I could actually

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.959 
right so by using this I could actually
connect<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.250> internet<00:02:54.370> via<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.879> ethernet

connect to the internet via the ethernet

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.869 
connect to the internet via the ethernet
port<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.689> then<00:02:55.780> use<00:02:55.989> these<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.500> do<00:02:57.219> it<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.549> mean

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
port and then use these to do it I mean

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.520
