sitting<00:02:26.859> on<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.280> set<00:02:27.609> and<00:02:27.910> especially

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
sitting on this set and especially

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.590 
sitting on this set and especially
because<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.560> way<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.459> took<00:02:30.609> I<00:02:31.180> really

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
because of the way that I took I really

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.550 
because of the way that I took I really
thought<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.079> was<00:02:32.260> going<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.410> be

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
thought that I was going to be

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.220 
thought that I was going to be
researching<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.280> field<00:02:33.780> doing

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
researching in the field doing

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
researching in the field doing
maybe<00:02:35.950> PhD<00:02:36.700> work<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.420> then<00:02:37.540> eventually

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
maybe PhD work and and then eventually

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.319 
maybe PhD work and and then eventually
research<00:02:38.410> for<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.829> university<00:02:39.609> storm-chasing

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
research for a university storm-chasing

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.449 
research for a university storm-chasing
and<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:40.930> I'm<00:02:41.290> watching<00:02:41.530> them<00:02:41.950> do<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.310> while

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
and now I'm watching them do that while

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.039 
and now I'm watching them do that while
I'm<00:02:42.640> out<00:02:42.760> there<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.090> covering<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.780> doing

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
I'm out there and covering it and doing

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.750 
I'm out there and covering it and doing
stories<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.739> still<00:02:44.980> I'm<00:02:45.190> still<00:02:45.430> doing

more<00:02:47.799> public<00:02:48.010> fashion<00:02:48.840> times<00:02:49.840> have<00:02:50.019> changed

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
more public fashion times have changed

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.800 
more public fashion times have changed

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
any longer it just doesn't work and it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.370 
any longer it just doesn't work and it
doesn't<00:02:54.760> fit<00:02:55.239> all<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.569> experience<00:02:56.200> and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
doesn't fit all of the experience and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.069 
doesn't fit all of the experience and
education<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.700> almost<00:02:58.030> all<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.299> us<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:58.690> at

this point science is still the

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.009 
this point science is still the
important<00:03:00.940> part<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.269> lot<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.510> people<00:03:01.750> for<00:03:01.989> some

I'd start with the education start with

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.600 
I'd start with the education start with
the<00:03:14.990> experiences<00:03:15.740> go<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.130> school<00:03:16.400> that
