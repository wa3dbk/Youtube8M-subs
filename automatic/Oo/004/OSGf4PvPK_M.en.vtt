00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:16.150
 and so how old are you 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.980
 Today I turned 76 76 years old and he 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.070
 still competing in bodybuilding and 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 and all natural how long are you 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.789
 this sport 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.940
 Exactly bodybuilding I started to do 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.140
 at the age of 66 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.820
 damn you started at 66 yes that way you know 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.289
 I like it because it brings 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.950
 health 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:44.440
 if god gave you a body then you should like 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.090
 should watch him besides this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.260
 helps with physical problems 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.570
 For example, relocation of the spine 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 for all his years and injured 5 drives 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.379
 his back 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.809
 the doctors even said that I didn’t walk 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.670
 I can become disabled but I was engaged 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.289
 bodybuilding and it helped me a lot 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.289
 precisely muscle corset 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.460
 they would like to say something 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.640
 fan people who watch us 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:24.130
 or young beginners 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:29.580
 athletes before the first thing I want to say 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:35.890
 please don't take steroids 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:41.170
 especially young you don't need to know 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.100
 everyone wants to be jocketed right now but 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 it doesn't happen 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.130
 I didn’t take them but I don’t have a day 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.130
 It was 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.780
 I was treated better than competed 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.509
 since I couldn't even get past 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.409
 basic qualification to 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:05.869
 perform but then I was invited and 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.090
 go listen listen clean 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.009
 unnecessary chemistry because how much is around 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.759
 information how much is online 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.129
 information 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.379
 why do they need it know not at all 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.239
 expected to be able to ever win on 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:25.940
 competitions you are already winners 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.489
 in this way we are absolutely right I am exactly 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.640
 also say to everyone just keep on 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.900
