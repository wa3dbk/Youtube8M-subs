Ecodiesel off-road Nathan this is the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
Laramie so it the wheels are like giant

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.730 
Laramie so it the wheels are like giant
and<00:01:04.239> it's<00:01:04.449> really<00:01:04.720> not<00:01:04.869> set<00:01:05.199> up<00:01:05.379> right<00:01:05.560> now<00:01:05.710> for

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
truck here dude yeah it is it is but now

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.420 
truck here dude yeah it is it is but now
you're<00:02:41.330> talking

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
you're talking

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
you're talking
competitors<00:02:43.430> are<00:02:44.090> heavy-duty<00:02:44.420> trucks<00:02:44.870> which

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
competitors are heavy-duty trucks which

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.449 
competitors are heavy-duty trucks which
are<00:02:45.260> actually<00:02:45.530> less<00:02:45.650> expensive<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.340> so

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
are actually less expensive to this so

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.660 
are actually less expensive to this so
you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.700> get<00:02:46.790> not<00:02:46.940> only<00:02:46.970> 500<00:02:47.690> yeah<00:02:48.350> nice<00:02:49.250> 25

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
you can get not only 500 yeah nice 25

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.180 
you can get not only 500 yeah nice 25
minute<00:02:49.850> dollars<00:02:50.030> for<00:02:50.239> less<00:02:50.390> time<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:51.410> but

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
minute dollars for less time on this but

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.210 
minute dollars for less time on this but
well<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:53.660> looking<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.320> handle<00:02:54.769> that's

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
well just looking for a handle that's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.170 
well just looking for a handle that's
good<00:02:55.489> for<00:02:56.269> lecture<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:56.690> fully<00:02:56.930> loaded<00:02:57.230> uh

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
good for lecture that's fully loaded uh

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.370 
good for lecture that's fully loaded uh
light<00:02:59.180> duty<00:02:59.480> that's<00:02:59.780> kind<00:02:59.930> of<00:02:59.959> crazy

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
light duty that's kind of crazy

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.440 
light duty that's kind of crazy
yep<00:03:00.860> yep<00:03:01.550> that's<00:03:01.610> true<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.269> at<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.420> other

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
yep yep that's true but at the other

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.240 
yep yep that's true but at the other
side<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.440> now<00:03:03.590> have<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.830> light<00:03:04.040> duty

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
side of it is you now have a light duty

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.090 
side of it is you now have a light duty
that<00:03:04.550> has<00:03:05.140> really<00:03:06.140> really<00:03:06.500> efficient

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
that has really really efficient

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.009 
that has really really efficient
powertrain<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:08.000> also<00:03:08.180> has<00:03:08.510> some<00:03:08.840> very

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
powertrain and it also has some very

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.720 
powertrain and it also has some very
nice<00:03:09.230> interior<00:03:09.590> actually<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.130> really<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.519> like

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
nice interior actually I really I like

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.150 
nice interior actually I really I like
this<00:03:10.940> better<00:03:11.150> than<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.019> Longhorn<00:03:12.890> because

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
this better than the Longhorn because

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.740 
this better than the Longhorn because
it's<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.489> not<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.820> freely<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.600> what<00:03:14.720> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
it's just not so freely you know what I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.600 
it's just not so freely you know what I
mean<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.079> more<00:03:15.230> business<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.100> was<00:03:16.370> talking

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
mean it's more business so I was talking

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.449 
mean it's more business so I was talking
to<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.510> chief<00:03:17.780> engineer<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.130> he's<00:03:19.280> been

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
to the chief engineer and he's been

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.940 
to the chief engineer and he's been
driving<00:03:19.670> one<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.060> these<00:03:20.239> as<00:03:20.570> his<00:03:20.930> daily<00:03:21.470> driver

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950

driving one of these as his daily driver
oh<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.250> diesel<00:03:22.579> yeah<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.480> he<00:03:23.600> said<00:03:23.780> he's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
oh the diesel yeah and he said he's

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
oh the diesel yeah and he said he's
getting<00:03:23.989> get<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.500> 700<00:03:25.459> miles

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
getting get this 700 miles

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.830 
getting get this 700 miles
and<00:03:27.730> tankful<00:03:28.330> how<00:03:28.840> big<00:03:29.020> is<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.170> tank<00:03:29.410> 26<00:03:30.310> gallons

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
and tankful how big is a tank 26 gallons

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.550 
and tankful how big is a tank 26 gallons
that's<00:03:31.840> damn<00:03:32.080> good

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
that's damn good

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.580 
that's damn good
that<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:32.920> damn<00:03:33.100> good<00:03:33.160> if<00:03:33.580> we<00:03:33.730> had<00:03:34.290> any<00:03:35.290> kind<00:03:35.500> of

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
that is damn good if we had any kind of

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.040 
that is damn good if we had any kind of
mathematical<00:03:36.340> message<00:03:36.880> we<00:03:37.540> could<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
mathematical message we could do the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.410 
mathematical message we could do the
math<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.830> figure<00:03:38.980> out<00:03:39.130> how<00:03:39.340> many<00:03:39.520> miles<00:03:40.150> per

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
math and figure out how many miles per

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.530 
math and figure out how many miles per
gallon<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:41.020> translates<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.670> out<00:03:43.240> there

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
gallon that translates to so out there

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.080 
gallon that translates to so out there
in<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.040> video<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.460> see<00:03:45.670> if<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.790> can<00:03:45.910> figure

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
in the video and see if you can figure

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.280 
in the video and see if you can figure
it<00:03:46.210> out<00:03:46.420> because<00:03:46.600> they<00:03:46.900> haven't<00:03:47.140> released

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
it out because they haven't released

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.900 
it out because they haven't released
official<00:03:47.770> numbers<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:48.490> we're<00:03:48.640> doing

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
official numbers in what we're doing

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.660 
official numbers in what we're doing
with<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> diesel<00:03:49.570> is<00:03:49.780> offering<00:03:50.620> an<00:03:50.770> option<00:03:51.160> to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
with the diesel is offering an option to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.300 
with the diesel is offering an option to
somebody<00:03:52.030> who's<00:03:52.270> interested<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.290> great<00:03:54.010> fuel

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
somebody who's interested in great fuel

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.790

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
a truck can do a lot of work in the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.800 
a truck can do a lot of work in the
process<00:04:02.950> right<00:04:03.310> now<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.550> getting<00:04:04.180> there<00:04:04.450> EPA

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
process right now of getting there EPA

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.479 
process right now of getting there EPA
certification<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:05.860> they're<00:04:06.070> being<00:04:06.250> kind<00:04:06.459> of

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
certification so they're being kind of

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.460 
certification so they're being kind of
hush-hush<00:04:06.730> about<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.989> this<00:04:08.170> thing<00:04:08.350> can

hush-hush about what this thing can

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.979 
hush-hush about what this thing can
actually<00:04:08.560> do<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:10.000> they<00:04:10.209> can<00:04:10.420> get<00:04:10.540> this<00:04:10.720> thing

actually do if they can get this thing
to<00:04:11.200> nearly<00:04:11.470> or<00:04:11.830> at<00:04:12.010> or<00:04:12.280> near<00:04:12.810> 30<00:04:13.810> miles<00:04:13.959> per

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
to nearly or at or near 30 miles per

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.080 
to nearly or at or near 30 miles per
gallon<00:04:14.410> highway<00:04:14.440> yeah<00:04:15.010> that'll<00:04:15.520> be<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.670> major

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
gallon highway yeah that'll be a major

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.160 
gallon highway yeah that'll be a major
coup

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170

[Music]

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.770 

so<00:04:25.040> I'm<00:04:25.430> not<00:04:25.730> sure<00:04:25.940> we<00:04:26.090> learned<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.390> lot<00:04:26.600> it

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
so I'm not sure we learned a lot it

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.990 
so I'm not sure we learned a lot it
wasn't<00:04:27.110> very<00:04:27.290> challenging<00:04:27.920> they<00:04:28.070> think<00:04:28.370> but

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
wasn't very challenging they think but

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.300
