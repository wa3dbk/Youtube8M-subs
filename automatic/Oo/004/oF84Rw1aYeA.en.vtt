roll<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.610> down<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.300> simple<00:02:34.019> now<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.709> could

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
roll it down that simple now you could

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.960 
roll it down that simple now you could
use<00:02:35.840> colored<00:02:36.890> pins<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> wanted<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.760> I

yellow before you put them on here you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
yellow before you put them on here you
definitely<00:02:47.519> could<00:02:47.880> with<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.209> Copic<00:02:48.540> markers
