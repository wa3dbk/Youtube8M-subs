00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
details and you can see the speed it's

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.309 
details and you can see the speed it's
downloading<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.890> can<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.160> cpu<00:04:09.610> Norbit<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.319> cpu

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
downloading you can do cpu Norbit a cpu
