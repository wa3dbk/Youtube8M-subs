probably not gonna show up on camera
when<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> push<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> clutch<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.149> via<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
when you push the clutch in via the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660 
when you push the clutch in via the
entire<00:02:03.750> thing<00:02:04.110> flexes<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> whole<00:02:05.100> cab<00:02:05.310> does

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
entire thing flexes the whole cab does

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.610 
entire thing flexes the whole cab does
that's

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
that's

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.850 
that's
well<00:02:08.620> that's<00:02:08.860> bad<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.670> anyway<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:11.410> not<00:02:11.650> too

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
well that's bad so anyway I'm not too

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.570 
well that's bad so anyway I'm not too
positive<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.610> what<00:02:12.760> I'm<00:02:12.850> gonna<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.240> with<00:02:13.450> it

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
positive on what I'm gonna do with it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.340 
positive on what I'm gonna do with it
I'm<00:02:15.580> probably<00:02:16.000> gonna<00:02:18.210> find<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.480> missing

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
I'm probably gonna find the missing

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.910 
I'm probably gonna find the missing
light<00:02:20.560> there<00:02:21.720> pound<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.930> body<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> semis

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
light there pound the body in the semis

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.620 
light there pound the body in the semis
straight<00:02:24.340> shape<00:02:26.610> fab<00:02:27.610> up<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.910> bumper<00:02:28.240> for<00:02:28.270> it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
straight shape fab up a bumper for it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.810 
straight shape fab up a bumper for it
get<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> running<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:30.130> probably<00:02:30.490> drive<00:02:30.700> it

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
get it running and probably drive it

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.670 
get it running and probably drive it
around<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.080> would<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.530> cool

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
around I think it would be kind of cool

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.590 
around I think it would be kind of cool
in<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> summer<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.970> I've<00:02:34.120> got<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.450> better

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
in the summer and I've got the better

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.620 
in the summer and I've got the better
part<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.020> year<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.350> get<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.560> working<00:02:35.740> I<00:02:36.630> mean

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
part of a year to get it working I mean

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.040 
part of a year to get it working I mean
look<00:02:37.780> at<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.930> that's<00:02:38.230> bad<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:40.630> reads<00:02:40.870> up

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
look at that that's bad so it reads up

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.570 
look at that that's bad so it reads up
to<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> hundred<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.740> don't<00:02:41.890> know<00:02:41.950> how<00:02:42.100> fast<00:02:42.370> it'll

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
to a hundred I don't know how fast it'll

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.260 
to a hundred I don't know how fast it'll
actually<00:02:42.790> go<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.860> I've<00:02:45.430> never<00:02:45.610> really<00:02:46.030> seen

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
actually go but I've never really seen

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.520 
actually go but I've never really seen
one<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.510> these<00:02:46.630> things<00:02:46.870> I've<00:02:47.110> never<00:02:47.320> driven

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
one of these things I've never driven

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.780 
one of these things I've never driven
one<00:02:48.030> never<00:02:49.030> even<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.540> much<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.810> heard<00:02:49.990> one<00:02:50.170> run

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
one never even so much as heard one run

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.830 
one never even so much as heard one run
reminds<00:02:51.790> me<00:02:52.000> how<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.210> you<00:02:52.270> open<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.600> hood<00:02:52.720> on
