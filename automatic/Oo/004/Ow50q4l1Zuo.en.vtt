about the skies at his shoulder pads
move<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> way<00:02:12.510> of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
move up so they don't get in the way of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.910
