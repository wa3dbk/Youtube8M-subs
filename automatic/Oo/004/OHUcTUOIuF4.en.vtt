00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.900
RUBICK: Everyone! Invoker is dead

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.500
and Pudge is unaccounted for.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.000
Keep your eyes peeled!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.300
Make sure to check your minimap frequently.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200
ENIGMA: Oh. Well, that's convenient.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.400
NIGEL: Here's those wards.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.800
So these will allow you to get rid of the

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300
enemy wards that are around here?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.500
ENIGMA: That's the idea.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.500
These stupid...

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.100
Yeah.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000
NIGEL: Well that's one down and one to-

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.200
ENIGMA: What?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.700
NIGEL: Enigma, run!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.100
ENIGMA: What, is there a...

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.600
OH MY GOD!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.200
ENIGMA: Try to hook me, Pudge, when I'm

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.100
running around like a crazy person erratically!

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.500
Oh yeah! Can't hook this! Hoo hoo hue hue!

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.500
Whoa. Advanced stop-casting tactics!

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.500
It's learning.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.600
OH! Tactical pause.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.600
RUBICK: Enigma, you really shouldn't do that.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.400
ENIGMA: You know, I normally wouldn't but this is against Pudge so...

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.100
F*** 'em!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.400
Well, f***.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
RUBICK: Blast!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.900
INVOKER: I have returned.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.300
RUBICK: Invoker, Exort 3 times!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.200
ENIGMA: Man, isn't it weird how we can just, like,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.300
talk to each other from way across the map?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.900
Well, holy shit! I'm talking to you while I'm dead.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.500
I did not know you could do that.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.500
Well, forget what I was saying before.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.000
Dis shit be craaazy.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.400
Ha! I speak to you from the great beyond! OoOoOh!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.900
Speaking of 'OoOh,' I just thought of what my Diretide costume should be this year.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.600
It's gonna be pretty sweet.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.200
Guess, guess what I'm gonna be.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100
RUBICK: Make 3 orange balls! Do it, quick!

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.100
ENIGMA: A purple ghost!

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.000
RUBICK: Shut up, Enigma!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.800
ENIGMA: Sorry.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.100
INVOKER: Affirmative. Exort. Exort!

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.900
EXORT!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.100
RUBICK: Invoke and Sunstriike right here! Right here!
