00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.530 
adds on to and I'm finally hooking stop
dude<00:02:46.390> DVI<00:02:46.720> not<00:02:47.200> DVI<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.680> HDMI<00:02:48.269> there<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.390> some

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
dude DVI not DVI to HDMI there is some

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.229 
dude DVI not DVI to HDMI there is some
color<00:02:49.989> contrast<00:02:50.410> difference<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.000> scheme

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
color contrast difference this is scheme

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.789 
color contrast difference this is scheme
by<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.480> way<00:02:53.459> look<00:02:54.459> at<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:55.680> definitely<00:02:56.680> more

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
by the way look at that definitely more

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.470 
by the way look at that definitely more
saturation<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.489> my<00:02:57.549> 23<00:02:58.030> inch<00:02:58.180> but<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.209> turn

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
saturation on my 23 inch but if I turn

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.110 
saturation on my 23 inch but if I turn
that<00:03:01.569> up<00:03:01.720> actually<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.440> how<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.549> gets<00:03:03.790> I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
that up actually this is how it gets I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.910 
that up actually this is how it gets I
actually<00:03:04.480> think<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.870> saturation<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.680> this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
actually think the saturation on this

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.690 
actually think the saturation on this
monitor<00:03:06.400> over<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.870> too<00:03:08.230> much<00:03:08.580> turn<00:03:09.580> it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
monitor over here it's too much turn it

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.240 
monitor over here it's too much turn it
down<00:03:09.780> when<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.840> get<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.049> chance<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.350> like

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
down when I get the chance I like

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.410 
down when I get the chance I like
playing<00:03:12.370> Grand<00:03:12.700> Theft<00:03:12.760> Auto<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.209> really

playing Grand Theft Auto with really

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.849 
playing Grand Theft Auto with really
high<00:03:13.510> saturation<00:03:14.260> because<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.709> game<00:03:14.890> gonna<00:03:15.160> be

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
high saturation because I game gonna be

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.009 
high saturation because I game gonna be
black<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.040> white<00:03:18.160> ish<00:03:18.370> sometimes<00:03:19.019> not
