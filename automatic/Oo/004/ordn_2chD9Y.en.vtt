00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
ridiculous on the right hand side though

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.759 
ridiculous on the right hand side though
he<00:04:08.459> was<00:04:08.699> 30<00:04:09.000> years<00:04:09.299> old<00:04:09.479> so<00:04:09.720> he's<00:04:09.930> getting<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.739> a

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
he was 30 years old so he's getting on a

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.890 
he was 30 years old so he's getting on a
bit<00:04:11.189> now<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.609> they<00:04:12.120> had<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.269> potential<00:04:12.659> of<00:04:12.720> nice

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
bit now and they had a potential of nice

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.569 
bit now and they had a potential of nice
to<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:13.319> he<00:04:13.409> still<00:04:13.590> had<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.889> potential<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.459> go

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
to so he still had the potential to go

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.129 
to so he still had the potential to go
up<00:04:14.699> a<00:04:14.790> little<00:04:14.939> bit<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:15.509> never<00:04:15.659> I<00:04:15.720> don't<00:04:15.810> think

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
up a little bit but never I don't think

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.050 
up a little bit but never I don't think
he<00:04:16.289> ever<00:04:16.470> done<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.009> but<00:04:17.130> 91<00:04:17.519> rated<00:04:17.789> for<00:04:17.940> him

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060
