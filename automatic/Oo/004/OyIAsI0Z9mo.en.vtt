don't have any dirt this way it looks

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.760 
don't have any dirt this way it looks
like<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> potato<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:37.429> can<00:01:38.429> still<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:40.470> rust

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
like a potato you can still see the rust

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.059 
like a potato you can still see the rust
and<00:01:41.159> stop<00:01:41.640> through<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.420> red<00:01:42.600> paint<00:01:42.899> great

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.730 
yeah so I think you should just do
heavier<00:01:56.280> coats<00:01:56.640> when<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.090> doing<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.569> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
for it

for it
it<00:02:22.560> look<00:02:22.739> badass<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.560> third<00:02:34.920> coat

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it look badass so this is the third coat

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.520 
it look badass so this is the third coat
or<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.389> will<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> third<00:02:37.079> coat<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
or this will be the third coat the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.500 
or this will be the third coat the
second<00:02:37.829> coat<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.010> right<00:02:38.310> now<00:02:38.430> did<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.209> my

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
second coat on right now did you see my

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.190 
second coat on right now did you see my
rims<00:02:39.780> weren't<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.470> good<00:02:40.530> shape<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.040> begin<00:02:41.519> I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
rims weren't in good shape to begin I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.420 
rims weren't in good shape to begin I
still<00:02:43.200> see<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.440> rest<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.489> dirt<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.569> build<00:02:45.780> up

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
still see the rest the dirt the build up

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.289 
still see the rest the dirt the build up
but<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.790> think<00:02:49.280> by<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> time<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.760> cover<00:02:51.030> it

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
but I think by the time you cover it

00:02:51.299 --> 00:03:06.310 
but I think by the time you cover it
turn<00:02:52.019> out<00:02:52.200> well

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.010 

yes<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.620> last<00:03:07.830> codon<00:03:08.400> here

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
yes the last codon here

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.940 
yes the last codon here
everything<00:03:10.020> turned<00:03:10.290> out<00:03:10.530> very<00:03:10.860> well

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
everything turned out very well

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:44.850 
everything turned out very well
I'd<00:03:13.950> recommend<00:03:14.340> plastidip

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.990 

so<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.610> finished<00:03:46.940> product<00:03:47.540> look<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:49.000> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
so the finished product look like and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:03.070 
so the finished product look like and
she<00:03:50.150> was<00:03:50.180> still<00:03:58.840> but<00:04:01.180> do<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.270> spot<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.750> missed

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
she was still but do you spot I missed

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.230 
she was still but do you spot I missed
but<00:04:03.380> all<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.280> did<00:04:04.430> was<00:04:04.550> spend<00:04:04.730> $60<00:04:05.480> on<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:07.240> and

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
but all I did was spend $60 on this and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.510 
but all I did was spend $60 on this and
this<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.870> looks<00:04:09.020> like<00:04:09.230> on<00:04:09.530> stock<00:04:10.100> rims

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
this is what it looks like on stock rims

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.880 
this is what it looks like on stock rims
that<00:04:10.670> look<00:04:10.910> like

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
that look like

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.560 
that look like
before<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:13.160> this<00:04:13.700> looks<00:04:13.970> better<00:04:14.180> than

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
before this this looks better than

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.620 
before this this looks better than
anything<00:04:15.070> any<00:04:16.070> spray-paint<00:04:16.730> you<00:04:17.000> can<00:04:17.180> do<00:04:17.360> with

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
anything any spray-paint you can do with

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.220 
anything any spray-paint you can do with
right<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:19.360> velocity<00:04:20.360> UPS<00:04:20.720> pretty<00:04:20.989> good<00:04:21.200> I

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
right so velocity UPS pretty good I

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:33.890 
right so velocity UPS pretty good I
think<00:04:22.600> 60<00:04:23.600> bucks<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:23.930> rims<00:04:24.170> not<00:04:25.100> too<00:04:25.250> bad

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.960 

you
