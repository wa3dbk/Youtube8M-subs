really made me mad and the reason for

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.060 
really made me mad and the reason for
that<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> seven

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that is because it was about a seven

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
that is because it was about a seven
minute<00:00:44.190> review<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.789> felt<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:47.570> maybe

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
minute review it felt like about maybe

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110

half<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:50.100> less<00:00:50.370> than<00:00:50.430> half<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
half or a little less than half at that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840 
half or a little less than half at that
time<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.660> devoted<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.559> issue<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.250> maybe

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
time was devoted to one issue and maybe

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
time was devoted to one issue and maybe
this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> kids<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.260> what

and these two things typically don't

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.270 
and these two things typically don't
mesh<00:03:57.769> very<00:03:58.040> well<00:03:59.290> you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.470> have<00:04:00.680> something

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
mesh very well you can have something

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.509 
mesh very well you can have something
like<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:03.290> because<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:04.040> game<00:04:04.250> you

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
like because because it's a game you

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.640 
like because because it's a game you
know<00:04:04.730> we<00:04:04.940> have<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.269> accept<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.690> fact<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:06.050> for

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
know we have to accept the fact that for

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.100 
know we have to accept the fact that for
most<00:04:06.800> games<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.790> will<00:04:07.910> take<00:04:08.180> multiple<00:04:08.900> shots

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
most games you will take multiple shots

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.720 
most games you will take multiple shots
before<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.620> die<00:04:09.800> unless<00:04:10.459> you're<00:04:10.610> playing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
before you die unless you're playing

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.400 
before you die unless you're playing
like<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:11.000> rainbow<00:04:11.239> six<00:04:11.570> game<00:04:11.780> where<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.230> is

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
like a rainbow six game where that is

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.030 
like a rainbow six game where that is
the<00:04:12.650> point<00:04:13.660> but<00:04:14.660> most<00:04:14.840> games<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.500> know<00:04:15.620> you'll

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
the point but most games you know you'll

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800 
the point but most games you know you'll
take<00:04:16.400> couple<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:16.820> headshots<00:04:17.000> you'll<00:04:17.450> take<00:04:17.660> a

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
take couple of headshots you'll take a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.900 
take couple of headshots you'll take a
bunch<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.200> body<00:04:18.410> shots<00:04:18.709> you'll<00:04:19.459> take<00:04:19.609> us<00:04:19.640> much

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
bunch of body shots you'll take us much

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.360 
bunch of body shots you'll take us much
shot<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.359> legs<00:04:20.540> before<00:04:20.780> before<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.590> die<00:04:21.770> but

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
shot and legs before before you die but

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.550 
shot and legs before before you die but
in<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.610> cutscene<00:04:23.150> we<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.229> able<00:04:24.320> to

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
in a cutscene we have to be able to

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.720 
in a cutscene we have to be able to
accept

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
accept

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.570 
accept
one<00:04:26.270> shot<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.720> head<00:04:26.930> you're<00:04:27.560> done<00:04:27.800> one

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
period of time those we kind of have to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.330 
period of time those we kind of have to
have<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:36.080> suspension<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.740> disbelief<00:04:36.860> in

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
like it's just if it bothers me when

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.350 
like it's just if it bothers me when
when<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.530> video<00:04:45.800> game<00:04:45.980> reviewer<00:04:46.370> spends<00:04:47.150> that

when a video game reviewer spends that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.690 
when a video game reviewer spends that
