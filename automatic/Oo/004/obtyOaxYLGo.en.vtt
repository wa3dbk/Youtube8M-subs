00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
something that's a lot of fun we have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.779 
something that's a lot of fun we have
some<00:00:19.740> rides<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.250> need<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.429> check<00:00:20.609> out

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
some rides that you need to check out

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.339 
some rides that you need to check out
that<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.599> get<00:00:21.720> ready<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.929> ride<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.080> green

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
that we get ready to ride the green

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.169 
that we get ready to ride the green
extreme<00:00:22.800> which<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.519> feel<00:00:23.730> pretty<00:00:24.000> good<00:00:24.119> about

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
extreme which I feel pretty good about

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.970 
extreme which I feel pretty good about
because<00:00:24.570> there's<00:00:24.779> netting<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.230> top<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
because there's netting on top of it but

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.349 
because there's netting on top of it but
it's<00:00:26.130> still<00:00:26.220> probably<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> longest<00:00:27.029> ride

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's still probably the longest ride

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.910 
it's still probably the longest ride
you've<00:00:27.539> been<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:27.960> far<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.560> there's<00:00:28.740> lots

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you've been on so far and there's lots

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.779 
you've been on so far and there's lots
of<00:00:29.009> twists<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.310> turns

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of twists and turns

00:00:29.789 --> 00:01:45.899 
of twists and turns
so<00:00:30.000> let's<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> turns<00:00:30.929> out

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.700 

so<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.149> pretty<00:01:47.750> long<00:01:47.990> ways<00:01:48.259> up<00:01:48.500> it's

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
so it's a pretty long ways up it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.930 
so it's a pretty long ways up it's
probably<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.070> tallest<00:01:49.220> right<00:01:49.580> here

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
probably the tallest right here

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.389 
probably the tallest right here
definitely<00:01:50.659> worth<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.840> hike<00:01:51.170> up<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.130> stairs

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
definitely worth the hike up the stairs

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.850 
definitely worth the hike up the stairs
there's<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:53.110> dark<00:01:54.110> pit<00:01:54.320> where<00:01:54.619> you're<00:01:54.740> just

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
there's a dark pit where you're just

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.200 
there's a dark pit where you're just
kind<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.250> dark<00:01:55.399> twisting<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.090> turning

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
kind of in the dark twisting and turning

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.540 
kind of in the dark twisting and turning
it's<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.539> whole<00:01:56.660> lot<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.810> fun<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.800> takes<00:01:58.340> forever

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
it's a whole lot of fun it takes forever

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.919 
it's a whole lot of fun it takes forever
to<00:01:58.700> get<00:01:58.850> up<00:01:58.940> there<00:01:59.090> but<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.420> over<00:01:59.659> in<00:01:59.750> like

to get up there but it's over in like
ten<00:02:00.259> seconds<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:00.770> feels<00:02:00.950> like<00:02:01.159> really<00:02:02.060> fun

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
ten seconds it feels like really fun

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.460 
ten seconds it feels like really fun
right<00:02:02.479> it's<00:02:03.440> tall<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:05.450> looks<00:02:05.630> awesome<00:02:05.929> and
