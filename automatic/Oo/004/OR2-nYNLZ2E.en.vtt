I'm<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.750> only<00:00:54.840> gripe<00:00:55.140> i<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.920> as

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I'm the only gripe i have about it as

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.029 
I'm the only gripe i have about it as
you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.149> sticks<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:57.899> quite<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> bit<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you can see it sticks out quite a bit so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
you can see it sticks out quite a bit so
most<00:00:59.850> jeans<00:01:00.180> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> float<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> there

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
most jeans kind of just float in there

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.100 
most jeans kind of just float in there
so<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.309> bit<00:01:02.399> loose<00:01:02.809> if<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:03.989> not

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so it's a little bit loose if you're not

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.580 
so it's a little bit loose if you're not
careful<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.799> could<00:01:04.890> probably<00:01:05.189> probably<00:01:06.590> slip

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
careful it could probably probably slip

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.760 
careful it could probably probably slip
out<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.830> pocket<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.670> you're

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
out of your pocket you know if you're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
out of your pocket you know if you're
you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.830> upside<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:11.939> comes<00:01:12.350> rolling

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you know upside down or comes rolling

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.080 
you know upside down or comes rolling
around<00:01:13.590> i<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:17.070> uses<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.610> pivot

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
around i don't know it also uses a pivot

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.090 
around i don't know it also uses a pivot
like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.900> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> zero<00:01:19.860> tolerance<00:01:20.070> knives

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you can see kind of a nice pivot it's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
you can see kind of a nice pivot it's
easy<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> doesn't<00:01:27.119> rotate<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:29.780> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
easy to just it doesn't rotate on you so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.149

as<00:02:52.739> far<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.299> grip<00:02:54.299> these<00:02:54.690> are<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:54.900> blasted<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
as far as grip these are all blasted and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.199 
as far as grip these are all blasted and
actually<00:02:57.540> provide<00:02:57.840> pretty<00:02:58.290> good<00:02:58.470> grip<00:02:59.209> but

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
actually provide pretty good grip but

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.180 
actually provide pretty good grip but
the<00:03:00.329> ergonomics<00:03:00.870> isn't<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.410> good<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.829> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the ergonomics isn't really good and the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.860
