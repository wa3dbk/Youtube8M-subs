00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.749 

now<00:00:01.800> here's<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.100> strange<00:00:03.049> problem<00:00:04.279> Putin<00:00:05.279> it

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
now here's a strange problem Putin it

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.890 
now here's a strange problem Putin it
comes<00:00:06.180> up<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.690> point<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.319> stops

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
comes up to this point it stops

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.440 

I<00:00:09.930> suppose<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.920> spinning<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:12.270> got

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
I suppose the spinning it's got

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.510 
I suppose the spinning it's got
electrical<00:00:12.930> power<00:00:13.140> it's<00:00:13.380> got<00:00:13.500> no<00:00:13.710> traction<00:00:14.070> so

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
electrical power it's got no traction so

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.360 
electrical power it's got no traction so
I<00:00:14.580> need<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.000> look<00:00:15.510> at<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.110> wrong

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
I need to look at what is wrong

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.520 
I need to look at what is wrong
this<00:00:18.120> is<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> only<00:00:18.570> train<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> does<00:00:19.290> it

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
this is the only train that does it

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.100 
this is the only train that does it
there's<00:00:19.770> something<00:00:20.070> odd<00:00:20.940> on<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.390> track<00:00:21.690> here

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
there's something odd on the track here

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.970 
there's something odd on the track here
if<00:00:23.040> I<00:00:23.670> push<00:00:23.910> down<00:00:23.940> on<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.540> it<00:00:25.260> gets<00:00:25.500> traction

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
if I push down on it it gets traction

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
if I push down on it it gets traction
and<00:00:26.310> also<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.360> train<00:00:27.630> itself<00:00:27.960> also

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and also so that the train itself also

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.710 
and also so that the train itself also
might<00:00:28.770> need<00:00:28.950> alteration<00:00:30.650> okay<00:00:31.680> so<00:00:32.510> noticed<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
might need alteration okay so noticed is

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.520 
might need alteration okay so noticed is
that<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.590> lift<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.040> track<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:37.350> gets

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that if I lift this track up it gets

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010 
that if I lift this track up it gets
traction<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.970> I've<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> slight<00:00:39.540> dip<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
traction so I've got a slight dip in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
traction so I've got a slight dip in
here<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.590> need<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> put<00:00:41.070> something<00:00:41.460> under

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
here I just need to put something under

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.979 
here I just need to put something under
there<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> fix<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:44.390> I've<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.660> similar

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
there to fix it I've got similar

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.350 
there to fix it I've got similar
traction<00:00:46.710> difficulty<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:51.050> same<00:00:52.050> thing<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
traction difficulty here same thing I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.680 
traction difficulty here same thing I
think<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.780> needs<00:00:56.540> lifting<00:00:57.540> up<00:00:57.980> okay<00:00:59.690> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think it just needs lifting up okay so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.110 
think it just needs lifting up okay so
the<00:01:00.840> cold<00:01:01.050> weather<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.340> making<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.879> little

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the cold weather is just making a little

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.639 
the cold weather is just making a little
difference<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.100> fix<00:01:05.399> that<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> I've

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
difference this is we fix that so I've

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.770 
difference this is we fix that so I've
painted<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> these<00:01:08.610> stirrers<00:01:09.509> coffee

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
painted one of these stirrers coffee

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.889 
painted one of these stirrers coffee
stirrers<00:01:10.289> and<00:01:10.970> I'm<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.450> cut<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> into

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
stirrers and I'm going to cut it into

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.680 
stirrers and I'm going to cut it into
small<00:01:13.530> sections<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> under<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
small sections and put that under the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.779 
small sections and put that under the
track<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.530> raise<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.039> up<00:01:17.160> a<00:01:17.190> little<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
track just to raise you up a little and

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.859 
track just to raise you up a little and
see<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:21.530> adding<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.649> under

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
see if that does it adding that under

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.150 
see if that does it adding that under
ballasted<00:01:24.869> foam<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.679> nice<00:01:25.890> thing

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
ballasted foam this is a nice thing

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.249 
ballasted foam this is a nice thing
about<00:01:26.250> stiff<00:01:26.729> everything<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.630> glued<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
about stiff everything just glued and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.309 
about stiff everything just glued and
tacked<00:01:28.500> down<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.950> easy<00:01:30.200> whoops<00:01:31.200> you're

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
tacked down it's easy whoops you're

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.050 
tacked down it's easy whoops you're
fully<00:01:31.590> under<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.039> case<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.369> need<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.849> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
fully under in case I need to take it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.839 
fully under in case I need to take it
out<00:01:33.209> again<00:01:34.069> push<00:01:35.069> your<00:01:35.220> fully<00:01:35.429> under<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.789> the

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
out again push your fully under in the

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:47.429 
out again push your fully under in the
moment

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.830 

that's<00:01:48.039> nice

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.250 

now<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.799> touch<00:01:52.010> igloo<00:01:52.930> and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:09.600 

more<00:01:56.740> pieces<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.130> granite<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.730> it's<00:01:58.030> done<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
more pieces of granite and it's done and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.970 
more pieces of granite and it's done and
here<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.060> are<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.750> adjust<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> front<00:02:11.380> bogie<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
here we are to adjust the front bogie a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.770 
here we are to adjust the front bogie a
little<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.580> was<00:02:12.760> given<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.360> particular

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
little that was given this particular

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.770 
little that was given this particular
training<00:02:14.290> issues<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:15.970> goes<00:02:16.270> round<00:02:16.540> this

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
training issues it now goes round this

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.990 
training issues it now goes round this
corner<00:02:17.050> nicely<00:02:17.530> nice<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.430> slow

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
corner nicely nice and slow

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.130 
corner nicely nice and slow
looks<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.080> everything<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.770> cute
