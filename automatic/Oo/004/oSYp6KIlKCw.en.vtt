00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.030
 I am preparing an exhibition at Beijing for 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.500
 me next May 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.590
 I will express a very committed way 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.120
 so these animals that replaces the man 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.800
 it's not very note that's for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 visual opportunities my island in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.040
 answer for more engaged in a museum 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.510
 national with a so I think for 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.540
 me it's better 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.480
 I work on the environment in the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.030
 landscape I want to take it to produce 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.210
 some elements be the character 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.220
 is something else it's a think that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.509
 animals today that that was a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.320
 quite rare level 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.820
 that's the man survive the whole 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.430
 the less they stole g in danger 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.330
 here one day he no longer can more 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.940
 to repair 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:34.060
 akiva repair them we make an effort but 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.140
 that if the mistakes any small I thought 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.320
 the world is over 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.450
 I really like it's him the tig me I 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 find it quite moving every year 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.900
 couple except on the old monkey monkey 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.660
 lonely he is lost because in the eyes 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.620
 sad at once I want the face 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.200
 of netbooks depth once second 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.310
 times there you I create a side come 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.100
 anguish lavish all my landscapes 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.000
 that they have a little more alpha silence to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.160
 the fault all gone up here is between 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.729
 stadiums and trees it gives a 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.179
 depth 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.760
 here and the earth we know more is this 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.340
 that it is the land it is the water there is a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.180
 total confusion between writing 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.140
 pictorial 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.190
 it's called international landscape that's 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.200
 true that I did not give a specific place 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.410
 at the age of 13 I start to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.270
 really I work a lot I 'm going 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.470
 when he propaganda things 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.650
 you have to do the illustration she was leaving 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.130
 on the wall for thirteen workers for 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.090
 soldiers training I think that's 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.520
 the right format 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.150
 it comes from a drift from the end of 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.280
 program 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.020
 painting is why all these 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.300
 problems 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.450
 the man who looks at the portrait is 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.750
 like the man who condemned the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.879
 mirror the project I think I 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.489
 do something of a revolution there 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.100
 not at all history 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.310
 I arrange I take a step had to sing 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.830
 you want to live but of which he 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:22.280
 anxiety I want to express game quickly 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.280
 to the world he creates and crimes
