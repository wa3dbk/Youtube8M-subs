stencils<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.399> becoming<00:00:41.820> obsolete<00:00:42.770> we<00:00:43.770> still

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
stencils are becoming obsolete we still

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840 
stencils are becoming obsolete we still
use<00:00:44.309> them<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.270> lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.480> times<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.850> like

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
use them and a lot of times we will like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
use them and a lot of times we will like
stencil<00:00:48.510> part<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.020> image<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.680> draw

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
stencil part of an image and then draw

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
stencil part of an image and then draw
in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> rest<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> natural<00:00:51.420> flow<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
in the rest because the natural flow and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.920 
in the rest because the natural flow and
rhythm<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> body<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> far<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.370> important

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
rhythm on the body is far more important

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.099 
rhythm on the body is far more important
as<00:00:55.430> in<00:00:56.430> looking<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.449> distance<00:00:57.660> like

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
as in looking at it from a distance like

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
as in looking at it from a distance like
if<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.890> tattoo<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.609> across<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
if I see it a tattoo from across the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
if I see it a tattoo from across the
room<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.629> still<00:01:01.379> want<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> easily

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
room I still want it to be easily

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.820 
room I still want it to be easily
readable<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.080> conform<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
readable I want it to to conform to the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.649 
readable I want it to to conform to the
body<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> move<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.150> client<00:01:06.570> as

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
body and move with the the client as

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.620 
body and move with the the client as
much<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.990> possible<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.820> when<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> I'm

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
much as possible so when I see it I'm

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
much as possible so when I see it I'm
seeing<00:01:12.630> movement<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.680> seeing<00:01:13.950> rhythm<00:01:14.369> I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
seeing movement I'm seeing rhythm I'm

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.580 
seeing movement I'm seeing rhythm I'm
seeing<00:01:15.000> art<00:01:15.330> happen<00:01:16.700> stencils<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.970> limiting

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
seeing art happen stencils very limiting

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
seeing art happen stencils very limiting
because<00:01:19.590> stencils<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.299> taking<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because stencils is just like taking a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.109 
because stencils is just like taking a
tracing<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> something<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.920> stamping<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
tracing of something and stamping it on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.609 
tracing of something and stamping it on
there<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.869> case<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> something

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
there in the case of something

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
there in the case of something
symmetrical<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.240> something<00:01:30.630> has<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> be

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
symmetrical like if something has to be

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.890 
symmetrical like if something has to be
perfectly<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> both<00:01:32.250> sides<00:01:32.610> or<00:01:33.060> things

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
perfectly even on both sides or things

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.960 
perfectly even on both sides or things
like<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.110> again<00:01:34.590> we're<00:01:34.920> limiting<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.729> art

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
like that again we're limiting the art

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.950 
like that again we're limiting the art
but<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.700> use<00:01:38.909> stencils<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> time

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
but we we do use stencils all the time

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.870 
but we we do use stencils all the time
there's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> machine<00:01:40.860> called<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> thermal<00:01:41.640> fax

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
there's a machine called the thermal fax

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 
there's a machine called the thermal fax
machine<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:43.100> stencil<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.220> run<00:01:44.460> through<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
machine the stencil is run through the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.600 
machine the stencil is run through the
machine<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.479> comes<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> piece<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.409> paper

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
machine it comes out on a piece of paper

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.539 
machine it comes out on a piece of paper
cut<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:48.320> shave<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.649> lube<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.009> skin

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
cut that out shave and lube the skin

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.600 
cut that out shave and lube the skin
stick<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:51.990> peel<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.829> let<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> dry

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
stick it on there peel it off let it dry

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
stick it on there peel it off let it dry
and<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.270> you've<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.079> purple

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and what you've got is just a purple

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
and what you've got is just a purple
little<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.950> rough<00:01:56.219> draft<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:56.880> tattoo

little like rough draft of your tattoo

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
little like rough draft of your tattoo
sitting<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:57.930> nothing<00:01:58.860> wrong<00:01:59.040> with

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
sitting there nothing wrong with

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.819 
sitting there nothing wrong with
stencils<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.299> every<00:02:00.570> day<00:02:00.829> however

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
stencils we use them every day however

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.910 
stencils we use them every day however
we<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.219> try<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.909> lean<00:02:03.570> our<00:02:03.930> clients<00:02:04.500> more

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
we do try and and lean our clients more

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.119 
we do try and and lean our clients more
towards<00:02:05.280> letting<00:02:05.909> us<00:02:06.149> draw<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:07.129> on
