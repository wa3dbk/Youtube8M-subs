are on mini cycle number four right now
as<00:00:15.570> part<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> things<00:00:17.279> that

have<00:00:17.550> changed<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.180> cycle<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.750> there

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
have changed in this cycle is that there

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590 
have changed in this cycle is that there
are<00:00:19.170> no<00:00:19.350> longer<00:00:19.650> shoulder<00:00:20.250> days<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> lot<00:00:21.510> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.599 
about filming a shoulder day and I have
you<00:00:25.080> been<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.680> bit<00:00:25.769> hesitant<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.400> so

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you been a little bit hesitant to do so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
you been a little bit hesitant to do so
only<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.689> don't<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:27.990> bringing<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
only because I don't like bringing the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.400 
only because I don't like bringing the
camera<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> gym<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
camera to the gym all the time but it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.500 
camera to the gym all the time but it
looks<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.399> got<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:32.790> bit<00:00:33.030> too<00:00:33.239> lazy

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
looks like I got a little bit too lazy

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.389 
looks like I got a little bit too lazy
in<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> aspect<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:34.860> longer<00:00:34.890> have

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in the aspect that we no longer have

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
in the aspect that we no longer have
shoulder<00:00:35.790> days<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.239> least<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.690> part<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
shoulder days at least as part of this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440 
shoulder days at least as part of this
current<00:00:37.410> cycle<00:00:37.950> instead<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.329> we

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
current cycle instead what we have is we

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.680 
current cycle instead what we have is we
have<00:00:39.629> an<00:00:39.870> extra<00:00:40.379> bench<00:00:40.620> day<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.190> well<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.149> an

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
have an extra bench day as well as an

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
have an extra bench day as well as an
extra<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.469> squat<00:00:43.770> day<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.460> rid<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
extra back squat day so we got rid of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.130 
extra back squat day so we got rid of
the<00:00:44.760> front<00:00:44.969> squat<00:00:45.120> day<00:00:45.420> also<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.020> point

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the front squat day also at this point

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
the front squat day also at this point
so<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> program<00:00:47.820> looks<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.510> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so the way the program looks for this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350 
so the way the program looks for this
cycle<00:00:48.960> which<00:00:49.379> lasts<00:00:49.649> two<00:00:49.890> weeks<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
cycle which lasts two weeks is that you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.069 
cycle which lasts two weeks is that you
have<00:00:51.600> two<00:00:52.530> back<00:00:52.770> squat<00:00:53.129> days<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:54.120> bench<00:00:54.780> days

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
have two back squat days two bench days

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.189 
have two back squat days two bench days
and<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.890> deadlift<00:00:56.730> day<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.480> well<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and one deadlift day as well as the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
and one deadlift day as well as the
normal<00:00:58.590> two<00:00:59.010> days<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.430> now<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
normal two days off now the way that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
normal two days off now the way that
today<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.050> laid<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.280> same

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
today is laid out it's actually the same

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.000 
today is laid out it's actually the same
as<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.690> previous<00:01:03.870> bench<00:01:04.320> day's<00:01:04.530> work<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
as the previous bench day's work so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
as the previous bench day's work so
we're<00:01:05.129> gonna<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.610> competition<00:01:06.000> style

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and then we're just gonna have whatever

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
and then we're just gonna have whatever
extra<00:01:12.750> assistance<00:01:13.200> work<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.590> typically<00:01:14.010> do

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
extra assistance work we typically do

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
extra assistance work we typically do
now<00:01:14.729> because<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.540> only<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
now because of that I'm only going to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
now because of that I'm only going to
film<00:01:16.590> probably<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> main<00:01:17.549> competition<00:01:18.030> style

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
film probably the main competition style

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
film probably the main competition style
sets<00:01:18.869> we'll<00:01:19.290> keep<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.650> video<00:01:19.830> short<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
sets we'll keep this video short and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.520 
sets we'll keep this video short and
simple<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.060> maybe<00:01:21.509> next<00:01:21.810> cycle<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
simple and maybe next cycle if the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
simple and maybe next cycle if the
shoulders<00:01:22.920> come<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.610> play<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.180> we'll

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
shoulders come back into play here we'll

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.340 
shoulders come back into play here we'll
film<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> workout
