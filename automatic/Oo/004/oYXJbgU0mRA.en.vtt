00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
gadget well this works with recon

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.599 
gadget well this works with recon
gadgets<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.620> you're<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:59.219> beacon

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
gadgets if you're out of your beacon

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.209 
gadgets if you're out of your beacon
your<00:01:00.090> MAV<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.570> walk<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.440> grab<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.739> slot

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
your MAV you walk up you grab that slot

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.280 
your MAV you walk up you grab that slot
it<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.550> give<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.989> then

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it will give you that first and then

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
it will give you that first and then
we'll<00:01:04.439> start<00:01:04.710> refilling<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.580> primary<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we'll start refilling the primary and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
we'll start refilling the primary and
secondary<00:01:06.659> there's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> natural<00:01:07.439> picking

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
secondary there's a natural picking

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.580 
secondary there's a natural picking
order<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> change<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
order but you can change that so if I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.100 
order but you can change that so if I
walk<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.790> gave<00:01:12.270> me<00:01:12.390> primary<00:01:12.840> ammo
