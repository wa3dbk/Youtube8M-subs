classes here in battlefield 4 the
engineer<00:00:28.289> kit<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> lot<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.939> fun<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
engineer kit and it is a lot of fun to

play in here in battlefield 4 and I have

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
play in here in battlefield 4 and I have
learned<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> hard<00:00:33.090> way<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.570> map<00:00:33.899> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
learned the hard way that this map is

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
learned the hard way that this map is
very<00:00:34.590> punishing<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.460> you're<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.000> engineer

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
very punishing if you're not an engineer

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.410 
very punishing if you're not an engineer
it<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.930> takes<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:38.219> squad<00:00:38.700> taking<00:00:39.210> care

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it really takes a good squad taking care

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
it really takes a good squad taking care
of<00:00:39.450> vehicles<00:00:39.930> otherwise<00:00:40.739> you're<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:40.980> going

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of vehicles otherwise you're just going

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.069 
of vehicles otherwise you're just going
to<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.399> overwhelmed<00:00:42.059> by<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> multitudes<00:00:42.870> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
to get overwhelmed by the multitudes of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.229 
to get overwhelmed by the multitudes of
tanks<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> spawn<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.700> any<00:00:44.940> given<00:00:45.210> moment

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
tanks that spawn in at any given moment

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.170 
tanks that spawn in at any given moment
I<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:46.020> faced<00:00:46.320> three<00:00:46.649> tanks<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.100> once<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
I have faced three tanks at once and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
I have faced three tanks at once and
that<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> quite<00:00:49.410> quite<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:49.920> unsurmountable

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that is a quite quite an unsurmountable

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
that is a quite quite an unsurmountable
hill<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.539> time<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.199> nice<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> have

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
hill at time so it's nice to have

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
hill at time so it's nice to have
engineers<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.579> team<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:54.210> what

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
engineers on your team that know what

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689 
engineers on your team that know what
they're<00:00:54.480> doing<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.710> am<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.250> liking<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
they're doing but I am really liking the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.069 
they're doing but I am really liking the
way<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> engineer<00:00:57.270> class<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.690> been<00:00:57.809> playing

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
way the engineer class has been playing

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
way the engineer class has been playing
this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.859> I've<00:00:58.949> been<00:00:59.010> primarily<00:00:59.430> working

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the default engineering weapon is pretty

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
the default engineering weapon is pretty
awesome<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.540> yesterday

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
awesome when I first got up yesterday

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
awesome when I first got up yesterday
morning<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> beta<00:01:20.130> released<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.640> couple

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
morning when the beta released a couple

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.100 
morning when the beta released a couple
of<00:01:20.909> my<00:01:21.000> buddies<00:01:21.150> had<00:01:21.450> already<00:01:21.600> plated<00:01:22.020> they're

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
of my buddies had already plated they're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
of my buddies had already plated they're
like<00:01:22.229> oh<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> mx4<00:01:22.950> yeah<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.729> really

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
like oh the mx4 yeah it's not really

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
like oh the mx4 yeah it's not really
that<00:01:23.970> great<00:01:24.210> i<00:01:24.270> mean<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> sucks<00:01:25.259> at

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that great i mean it's kind of sucks at

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
that great i mean it's kind of sucks at
range<00:01:25.619> i<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.369> oh<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
range i was like oh that's kind of a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
range i was like oh that's kind of a
bummer<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> PDW<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.590> typically

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bummer because it is a PDW and typically

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
bummer because it is a PDW and typically
you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> PDW<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.360> battlefield

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you know the PDW is like in battlefield

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.300 
you know the PDW is like in battlefield
3<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.380> were<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.619> bit<00:01:31.799> weaker<00:01:32.189> at

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
3 there were a little bit weaker at

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
3 there were a little bit weaker at
range<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.759> were<00:01:32.820> better<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.240> close<00:01:33.270> which

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
range they were better up close which

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.600 
range they were better up close which
makes<00:01:34.470> sense<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> personal

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
makes sense because you know a personal

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.819 
makes sense because you know a personal
defense<00:01:35.909> weapon<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.590> close

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
defense weapon should be good up close

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
defense weapon should be good up close
not<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.970> long<00:01:39.150> range<00:01:39.420> i<00:01:39.570> mean<00:01:39.689> that's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
not so good at long range i mean that's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.719 
not so good at long range i mean that's
that's<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.380> characteristic<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> actual

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that's the characteristic of the actual

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
that's the characteristic of the actual
weapon<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.780> when<00:01:42.869> i<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> try<00:01:43.860> in

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
weapon but when i actually got to try in

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
weapon but when i actually got to try in
it<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> realized<00:01:44.790> something<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
it I realized something you know this is

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.859 
it I realized something you know this is
a<00:01:46.020> good<00:01:46.439> all-around<00:01:46.740> weapon<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.600> all

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
a good all-around weapon and I have all

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
a good all-around weapon and I have all
the<00:01:49.020> weapons<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.500> played<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> beta

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the weapons I've played with in the beta

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
the weapons I've played with in the beta
this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.570> weapon<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.500> like

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
this is the weapon that I think I like

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
this is the weapon that I think I like
the<00:01:52.860> most<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.729> AK<00:01:54.000> 5<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> no<00:01:54.540> slouch

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the most now the AK 5 is no slouch

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
the most now the AK 5 is no slouch
they're<00:01:55.110> both<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.680> good<00:01:55.799> weapons<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> if

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
they're both really good weapons and if

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910 
they're both really good weapons and if
you<00:01:56.790> had<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> compare<00:01:57.360> them<00:01:57.479> both<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.320> would<00:01:58.740> say

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you had to compare them both I would say

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.380 
you had to compare them both I would say
that<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> AK<00:01:59.759> 5<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.299> bit

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that you know the AK 5 is a little bit

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
that you know the AK 5 is a little bit
better<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.689> range<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.619> gonna<00:02:01.740> take<00:02:01.979> fewer

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
better at range I just gonna take fewer

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.760 
better at range I just gonna take fewer
shots<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> MX<00:02:03.780> mx4<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
shots but the you know the MX mx4 is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.440 
shots but the you know the MX mx4 is
just<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.460> an<00:02:05.640> all-around<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.240> solid

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
just it's just an all-around just solid

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
just it's just an all-around just solid
weapon<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.649> matter<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.190> choose<00:02:08.220> with

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
weapon so no matter what you choose with

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.210 
weapon so no matter what you choose with
the<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.450> engineering<00:02:09.929> class<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.920> you've

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the the engineering class I think you've

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.110 
the the engineering class I think you've
got<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> lot<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> weapons<00:02:12.000> at<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.360> disposal

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
got a lot of weapons at your disposal

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.180 
got a lot of weapons at your disposal
so<00:02:13.510> that's<00:02:14.379> something<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:14.739> really<00:02:14.769> excited

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
so that's something I'm really excited

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.770 
so that's something I'm really excited
about<00:02:15.430> because<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.819> mean<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.269> only<00:02:16.420> get<00:02:16.569> three

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
about because I mean you only get three

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.390 
about because I mean you only get three
choices<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.260> could<00:02:17.379> either<00:02:17.500> do<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.769> acw-r

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
choices you could either do the acw-r

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.070 
choices you could either do the acw-r
which<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.819> will<00:02:19.030> be<00:02:19.060> doing<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.480> video<00:02:19.599> on<00:02:19.930> of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
which I will be doing a video on of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960 
which I will be doing a video on of
course<00:02:20.349> because<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:20.950> my<00:02:21.159> favorite<00:02:21.580> battle

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
course because it was my favorite battle

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.119 
course because it was my favorite battle
2<00:02:22.090> 3<00:02:22.330> weapon<00:02:22.629> you<00:02:23.080> got<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> mx4<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:23.980> got

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
2 3 weapon you got the mx4 then you got

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.940 
2 3 weapon you got the mx4 then you got
the<00:02:24.220> AK<00:02:24.519> 5<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.900> engineering<00:02:26.379> kit<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.739> in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the AK 5 so the engineering kit is in

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.380 
the AK 5 so the engineering kit is in
good<00:02:27.129> hands<00:02:27.430> right<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.819> think<00:02:27.940> there's<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
good hands right now I think there's a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.850 
good hands right now I think there's a
lot<00:02:28.659> of<00:02:28.720> variety<00:02:29.260> there's<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.590> lot<00:02:29.829> more

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
lot of variety there's a lot more

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.710 
lot of variety there's a lot more
usefulness<00:02:30.640> too<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.000> that's<00:02:31.150> great<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.569> see

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
usefulness too and that's great to see

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.569 
usefulness too and that's great to see
because<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> problems<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.860> had<00:02:33.159> with

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
because one of the problems I had with

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.460 
because one of the problems I had with
battle<00:02:33.849> 23<00:02:34.180> was<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.450> lack<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.690> class<00:02:35.049> variety

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
battle 23 was the lack of class variety

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.190 
battle 23 was the lack of class variety
you<00:02:35.799> typically<00:02:36.190> saw<00:02:36.549> support<00:02:37.060> sometimes<00:02:38.049> you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
you typically saw support sometimes you

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.509 
you typically saw support sometimes you
know<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.440> other<00:02:38.590> thirty<00:02:38.920> percent<00:02:39.340> would

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
know that other thirty percent would

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.850 
know that other thirty percent would
play<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> mix<00:02:40.150> between<00:02:40.390> like<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:41.349> know<00:02:41.440> maybe<00:02:41.739> a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
play a mix between like you know maybe a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.069 
play a mix between like you know maybe a
couple<00:02:42.069> recons<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.879> you'd<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.120> your<00:02:43.180> your

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
couple recons and you'd have your your

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.229 
couple recons and you'd have your your
support<00:02:44.500> your<00:02:44.890> engineers<00:02:45.340> out<00:02:45.519> there<00:02:45.579> but<00:02:46.030> I

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
support your engineers out there but I

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.580 
support your engineers out there but I
think<00:02:46.599> engineer<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.049> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> be<00:02:47.349> one<00:02:47.500> of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
think engineer is going to be one of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.259 
think engineer is going to be one of
those<00:02:47.650> heavily<00:02:48.069> play<00:02:48.250> classes<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.760> really<00:02:49.120> do

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
those heavily play classes I really do

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.089 
those heavily play classes I really do
it<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.629> in<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.959> really<00:02:50.349> good<00:02:50.590> position<00:02:50.799> right

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
it is in a really good position right

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.910 
it is in a really good position right
now<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.030> weapons<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.599> like<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.709> fact

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
now I like the weapons I like the fact

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.770 
now I like the weapons I like the fact
that<00:02:54.069> they're<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.549> useful<00:02:55.000> i<00:02:55.120> mean<00:02:55.269> this

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
that they're really useful i mean this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.210 
that they're really useful i mean this
map<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.200> particular<00:02:56.650> there's<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:56.920> lot<00:02:57.190> of

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
map in particular there's a lot of

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.949 
map in particular there's a lot of
vehicles<00:02:57.489> if<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.390> don't<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.720> couple

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
vehicles if you don't have a couple

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.809 
vehicles if you don't have a couple
engineers<00:02:59.500> in<00:02:59.650> your<00:02:59.859> squad<00:03:00.159> you're<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:00.730> to

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
engineers in your squad you're going to

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.210 
engineers in your squad you're going to
be<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.329> know<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> pretty<00:03:02.379> bad<00:03:02.590> spot<00:03:02.950> because

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
be you know in a pretty bad spot because

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
that about it i think the engineer class

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.280 
that about it i think the engineer class
is<00:03:57.910> my<00:03:58.120> favorite<00:03:58.449> right<00:03:58.599> now<00:03:58.629> if<00:03:58.900> i<00:03:59.019> had<00:03:59.169> to

is my favorite right now if i had to

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.750 
is my favorite right now if i had to
pick<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.500> class<00:03:59.799> that<00:03:59.980> i<00:04:00.069> had<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.310> play<00:04:00.489> for<00:04:00.549> the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
pick a class that i had to play for the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.939 
pick a class that i had to play for the
rest<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.150> my<00:04:01.239> battlefield<00:04:01.569> 4<00:04:01.900> career<00:04:02.230> which<00:04:02.799> is

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
rest of my battlefield 4 career which is

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:03.839 
rest of my battlefield 4 career which is
something<00:04:03.099> that's<00:04:03.250> kind<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.519> sad<00:04:03.669> to<00:04:03.819> think

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
something that's kind of sad to think

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.069 
something that's kind of sad to think
about<00:04:04.150> because<00:04:04.269> battle<00:04:04.629> for<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.780> floor<00:04:04.959> isn't

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
about because battle for the floor isn't

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.629 
about because battle for the floor isn't
even<00:04:05.349> out<00:04:05.440> yet<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:06.010> would<00:04:06.129> stink<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.519> only

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
even out yet and it would stink to only

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.729 
even out yet and it would stink to only
be<00:04:06.819> able<00:04:06.849> to<00:04:07.060> play<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:07.389> class<00:04:07.690> but<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.620> would

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
be able to play one class but it would

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.319 
be able to play one class but it would
be<00:04:08.769> definitely<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.370> engineer<00:04:09.699> class<00:04:09.879> because

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
be definitely the engineer class because

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.939 
be definitely the engineer class because
it<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> lot<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.049> fun<00:04:11.169> i'm<00:04:11.530> really<00:04:11.829> enjoying

I<00:04:14.379> can't<00:04:14.590> wait<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:14.889> try<00:04:15.129> out<00:04:15.220> some<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.549> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
that it's it's on par with a lot of the

that it's it's on par with a lot of the

laughs<00:04:26.889> I<00:04:27.069> mean<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.240> pretty<00:04:28.449> wide<00:04:28.690> open

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
laughs I mean this is a pretty wide open

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.540 
laughs I mean this is a pretty wide open
map<00:04:29.169> though<00:04:29.379> so<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.680> never<00:04:29.979> know<00:04:30.190> we<00:04:30.370> could

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
map though so you never know we could

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.010 
map though so you never know we could
get<00:04:30.639> into<00:04:30.819> some<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.060> these<00:04:31.120> smaller<00:04:31.300> maps<00:04:31.780> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
get into some of these smaller maps and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.210 
get into some of these smaller maps and
we'll<00:04:32.229> start<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.620> see<00:04:32.650> where<00:04:33.009> it's<00:04:33.129> a<00:04:33.190> little

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
we'll start to see where it's a little

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.249 
we'll start to see where it's a little
bit<00:04:33.490> more<00:04:33.639> underpowered<00:04:34.030> but<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:34.900> think<00:04:34.990> in

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
bit more underpowered but I think in

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.559 
bit more underpowered but I think in
terms<00:04:35.409> of<00:04:35.650> pure<00:04:35.919> battlefield<00:04:36.580> power<00:04:36.789> engineer

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.749 
terms of pure battlefield power engineer
is<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> really<00:04:38.530> solid<00:04:38.770> choice<00:04:39.069> if<00:04:39.340> you're

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759

can<00:04:56.199> have<00:04:56.229> a<00:04:56.319> pretty<00:04:56.530> good<00:04:56.680> time<00:04:56.830> now<00:04:57.069> you<00:04:57.280> see

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
can have a pretty good time now you see

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.279 
can have a pretty good time now you see
me<00:04:57.759> using<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.090> AK<00:04:58.330> 5<00:04:58.569> here<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:58.990> can<00:04:59.080> see

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
me using the AK 5 here and you can see

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.350 
me using the AK 5 here and you can see
that<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.560> just<00:04:59.830> slices<00:05:00.400> through<00:05:00.550> people<00:05:00.909> so<00:05:01.090> I

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
that it just slices through people so I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.960 
that it just slices through people so I
definitely<00:05:01.990> like<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.319> AK<00:05:02.710> 5<00:05:02.949> is<00:05:03.220> more<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.729> a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
definitely like the AK 5 is more of a a

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.360 
definitely like the AK 5 is more of a a
longer<00:05:04.419> range<00:05:04.569> weapon<00:05:05.050> but<00:05:05.919> if<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.039> haven't

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
longer range weapon but if you haven't

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.219 
longer range weapon but if you haven't
unlocked<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.819> yet<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.150> only<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.630> mx4

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
unlocked it yet you only have the mx4

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.080 
unlocked it yet you only have the mx4
it's<00:05:08.530> definitely<00:05:09.099> a<00:05:09.370> good<00:05:09.550> weapon<00:05:09.729> that<00:05:10.030> I

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
it's definitely a good weapon that I

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.180 
it's definitely a good weapon that I
think<00:05:10.389> is<00:05:10.479> on<00:05:10.599> par<00:05:10.840> with<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.050> AK<00:05:11.229> 5<00:05:11.620> if<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.979> had

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
think is on par with the AK 5 if I had

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.610 
think is on par with the AK 5 if I had
to<00:05:12.310> choose<00:05:12.340> one<00:05:12.759> I<00:05:13.229> think<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.259> would<00:05:14.349> probably

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
to choose one I think I would probably

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.649 
to choose one I think I would probably
go<00:05:14.680> with<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.889> AK<00:05:14.949> 5<00:05:15.340> just<00:05:15.669> because<00:05:16.000> i<00:05:16.030> am<00:05:16.360> a

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
go with the AK 5 just because i am a

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.499 
go with the AK 5 just because i am a
more<00:05:16.930> long-range<00:05:17.259> player<00:05:17.889> i<00:05:18.310> like<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.270> be<00:05:19.389> able

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
more long-range player i like to be able

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.749 
more long-range player i like to be able
to<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:20.229> do<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.889> little<00:05:21.069> bit<00:05:21.190> more<00:05:21.280> damage<00:05:21.639> at

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
to to do a little bit more damage at

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.249 
to to do a little bit more damage at
range<00:05:21.789> but<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:22.449> know<00:05:22.539> I<00:05:22.569> don't<00:05:22.870> really<00:05:23.020> have<00:05:23.169> a

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
range but you know I don't really have a

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.570 
range but you know I don't really have a
whole<00:05:23.440> lot<00:05:23.469> of<00:05:23.620> problem<00:05:24.039> doing<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.310> with<00:05:24.490> the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
whole lot of problem doing that with the

whole lot of problem doing that with the
mx4<00:05:25.030> but<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.419> would<00:05:25.539> just<00:05:25.569> be<00:05:25.750> my<00:05:25.930> personal

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
mx4 but that would just be my personal

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.110 
mx4 but that would just be my personal
preference<00:05:26.560> so<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.129> hope<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:27.729> guys<00:05:27.789> did<00:05:28.030> enjoy
