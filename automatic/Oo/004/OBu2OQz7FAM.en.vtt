00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.830 
when for the first time autumn RC gave
added<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.220> day<00:00:23.220> date<00:00:23.460> complication<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.449> moon

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
added a day date complication and moon

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
added a day date complication and moon

reference<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.439> great<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:28.920> about<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
reference the great thing about this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.070 
reference the great thing about this
watch<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> preserves<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
watch is that it preserves all of the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.959 
watch is that it preserves all of the
essential<00:00:31.529> features<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.279> Gerald<00:00:32.610> gem<00:00:32.820> to

essential features of the Gerald gem to
1972<00:00:33.750> original<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.219> adds<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> additional

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
1972 original but it adds the additional

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.360 
1972 original but it adds the additional
refinement<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.170> day<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> date<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> moon

refinement of a day a date and a moon
phase<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> great<00:00:39.270> complication

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
phase so you have a great complication

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.209 
phase so you have a great complication
of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.170> classic<00:00:40.770> look

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of the classic look

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369

the<00:00:41.430> definitive<00:00:42.090> look<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.660> royal<00:00:42.870> oak<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the definitive look of the royal oak you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
the definitive look of the royal oak you
get<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:43.950> everyday<00:00:44.340> complication<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
get an everyday complication that you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
get an everyday complication that you
can<00:00:45.480> always<00:00:45.840> use<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.260> easy<00:00:46.469> reference<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
can always use for easy reference that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
can always use for easy reference that
is<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> day<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> date<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> refer

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is the day and the date I know I refer

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049

to my calendar watches daily and then

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.549 
to my calendar watches daily and then
you<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> romantic<00:00:51.989> somewhat

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you get the romantic somewhat

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.490 
you get the romantic somewhat
superfluous<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.879> fun<00:00:54.300> complication<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> the

for 2015 in a big way so let's talk a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
little bit about this watch where it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
little bit about this watch where it
came<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.630> where<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.080> fits<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> Royal<00:01:07.950> Oak

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
came from where it fits in the Royal Oak

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.219 
came from where it fits in the Royal Oak
continuity<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> brings<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> table

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
continuity what it brings to the table

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.950 
continuity what it brings to the table
as<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> standalone<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.430> also<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.689> wears

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
as a standalone and also how it wears

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.179 
as a standalone and also how it wears
because<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.439> feel<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> whenever<00:01:14.040> you're

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
because I feel that whenever you're

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
because I feel that whenever you're
talking<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> Royal<00:01:14.880> Oak<00:01:15.090> which<00:01:15.689> uniquely

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
talking about a Royal Oak which uniquely

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
talking about a Royal Oak which uniquely
integrates<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> bracelet<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> case

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
integrates the bracelet and the case

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.240 
integrates the bracelet and the case
with<00:01:18.210> rather<00:01:18.390> large<00:01:18.810> lugs<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> talk

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
with rather large lugs you have to talk

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
with rather large lugs you have to talk
not<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> size<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> watch<00:01:21.750> but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
not just about the size of the watch but

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380 
not just about the size of the watch but
how<00:01:22.500> large<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.610> wears<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.270> that's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
how large it actually wears and that's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
how large it actually wears and that's
why<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.720> open<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> wrist

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
why I'm gonna open this one with a wrist

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100 
why I'm gonna open this one with a wrist
shot<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.420> wrist<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
shot you can see on my wrist which is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
shot you can see on my wrist which is
six<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> third<00:01:28.590> inches<00:01:29.130> 16<00:01:29.520> centimeters

six and a third inches 16 centimeters
this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.990> full<00:01:31.290> bodied<00:01:31.680> watch<00:01:31.920> although

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this is a full bodied watch although

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480 
this is a full bodied watch although
nominally<00:01:32.640> 36<00:01:33.600> millimeters<00:01:34.110> across<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.280> one

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
nominally 36 millimeters across this one

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.730 
nominally 36 millimeters across this one
measures<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:36.270> over<00:01:36.570> 45<00:01:37.020> millimeters<00:01:37.590> from

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
measures just over 45 millimeters from

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
measures just over 45 millimeters from
lug<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.400> lug<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> even<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> little

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
lug to lug and even then it's a little

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.140 
lug to lug and even then it's a little
bit<00:01:40.409> difficult<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.860> express<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.460> lug<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.939> lug

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
bit difficult to express what lug to lug

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
bit difficult to express what lug to lug
is<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.079> those<00:01:43.290> bracelet

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is because you can see those bracelet

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.789 
is because you can see those bracelet
plots<00:01:44.520> flow<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.720> less<00:01:45.840> seamlessly<00:01:46.439> from

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

just<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> bit<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.250> would<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:51.049> this<00:01:52.049> wear<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> not
