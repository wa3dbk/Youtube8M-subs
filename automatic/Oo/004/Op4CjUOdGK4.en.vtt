axe<00:06:11.879> are<00:06:12.179> pinning<00:06:12.449> jig<00:06:12.889> make<00:06:13.889> sure<00:06:14.159> that<00:06:14.459> the

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
axe are pinning jig make sure that the

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.489 
axe are pinning jig make sure that the
grinder<00:06:14.969> is<00:06:14.999> unplugged<00:06:15.509> the<00:06:15.990> universal

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:16.499 
grinder is unplugged the universal

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.230 
grinder is unplugged the universal
support<00:06:16.949> should<00:06:17.189> be<00:06:17.339> in<00:06:17.459> the<00:06:17.550> vertical<00:06:17.939> mounts

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
support should be in the vertical mounts

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.969 
support should be in the vertical mounts
on<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.389> grinder<00:06:18.839> so<00:06:19.139> that<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.409> grinding<00:06:19.829> will

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
on the grinder so that the grinding will

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.839 
on the grinder so that the grinding will
occur<00:06:20.279> against<00:06:20.699> the<00:06:20.849> rotation<00:06:21.360> direction

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
occur against the rotation direction

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.850 
occur against the rotation direction
slide<00:06:23.849> the<00:06:24.059> act<00:06:24.240> sharpening<00:06:24.779> jig<00:06:25.110> on<00:06:25.289> to<00:06:25.740> the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
slide the act sharpening jig on to the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.249 
slide the act sharpening jig on to the
universal<00:06:26.369> support<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:27.029> insert<00:06:27.869> the<00:06:28.079> axe

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
universal support and insert the axe

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.459 
universal support and insert the axe
into<00:06:28.649> the<00:06:28.919> jig<00:06:29.159> like<00:06:29.369> this<00:06:30.289> adjust<00:06:31.289> the

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
into the jig like this adjust the

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.109 
into the jig like this adjust the
grinding<00:06:31.919> angle<00:06:32.279> by<00:06:32.459> raising<00:06:32.759> or<00:06:33.059> lowering

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:33.119 
grinding angle by raising or lowering

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.769 
grinding angle by raising or lowering
the<00:06:33.659> universal<00:06:34.139> support<00:06:35.509> double<00:06:36.509> check<00:06:36.749> that

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:36.779 
the universal support double check that

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.839 
the universal support double check that
all<00:06:36.990> knobs<00:06:37.319> are<00:06:37.559> tight<00:06:37.800> and<00:06:38.009> then<00:06:38.459> plug<00:06:38.699> the

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
all knobs are tight and then plug the

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.619 
all knobs are tight and then plug the
grinder<00:06:39.179> back<00:06:39.389> in<00:06:40.219> when<00:06:41.219> sharpening<00:06:41.729> rock<00:06:42.360> the

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629 
grinder back in when sharpening rock the

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:44.779 
grinder back in when sharpening rock the
axe<00:06:42.839> handle<00:06:43.199> back<00:06:43.649> and<00:06:43.680> forth<00:06:44.159> rather<00:06:44.519> than

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
axe handle back and forth rather than

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:45.890 
axe handle back and forth rather than
sliding<00:06:45.269> it<00:06:45.389> to<00:06:45.419> shore

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
sliding it to shore

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.689 
sliding it to shore
open<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.229> entire<00:06:46.380> cutting<00:06:47.130> edge<00:06:47.250> of<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.490> axe

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
open the entire cutting edge of the axe

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.140 
open the entire cutting edge of the axe
in<00:06:48.060> a<00:06:48.449> slight<00:06:48.720> curve<00:06:49.020> that's<00:06:49.919> it<00:06:50.280> now<00:06:50.940> let's

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
in a slight curve that's it now let's

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.990 
in a slight curve that's it now let's
sharpen<00:06:51.389> some<00:06:51.720> tools
