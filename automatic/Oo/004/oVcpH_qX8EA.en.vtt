00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
model LD lift master why I keep saying

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.320 
model LD lift master why I keep saying
low<00:00:23.400> faster<00:00:23.730> lifted<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.480> model<00:00:25.320> LD<00:00:25.740> 100<00:00:26.250> ah<00:00:26.430> I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
low faster lifted or model LD 100 ah I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.709 
low faster lifted or model LD 100 ah I
have<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.980> did<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.929> el-ad<00:00:30.929> model<00:00:31.619> 125

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
have or I did have the el-ad model 125

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.750 
have or I did have the el-ad model 125
and<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> quarter<00:00:34.770> horsepower<00:00:35.250> unit

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and that was a quarter horsepower unit

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
and that was a quarter horsepower unit
so<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.530> said<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.140> my<00:00:40.350> LED

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
so it said it on that one and on my LED

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.500 
so it said it on that one and on my LED
555<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.450> says<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.379> underneath<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
555 it says it right underneath the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
555 it says it right underneath the
model<00:00:45.510> number<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
model number there but on this one it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.450 
model number there but on this one it
does<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.100> say<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:49.050> what

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
does not say that so I don't know what

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
does not say that so I don't know what
horsepower<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.969> I'm<00:00:51.270> guessing<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.500> of

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
horsepower is I'm guessing because of

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.029 
horsepower is I'm guessing because of
the<00:00:52.770> fact<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> LED<00:00:53.820> 125<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> quarter

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the fact that the LED 125 was a quarter

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
the fact that the LED 125 was a quarter
or<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.399> guessing<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.149> gonna<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.420> with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
or so I'm guessing I'm gonna go with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.650 
or so I'm guessing I'm gonna go with
quarter<00:00:57.840> horse<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.359> this<00:01:00.359> as

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
quarter horse but I don't know this as

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.490 
quarter horse but I don't know this as
you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.190> was<00:01:02.190> made<00:01:02.520> by<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.500> Lions

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500

Alliance manufacturing company because
of<00:01:09.479> course<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.930> looks<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.860> genie

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of course this looks just like the genie

got rid of that when I send out a bunch

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.140 
got rid of that when I send out a bunch
of<00:01:24.210> openers<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.290> figured<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> had<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> 555<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
of openers I figured I had the 555 and I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
is they have chain half cable and there

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
is they have chain half cable and there
is<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> cable<00:01:49.530> pulley<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> front<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.520> one

is a cable pulley on the front this one
here<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> full<00:01:51.329> chain<00:01:51.600> drive<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:54.180> has<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
here is a full chain drive this has the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
here is a full chain drive this has the
sport<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.110> punch<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.320> dip

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
sport here this is the punch out dip

sport here this is the punch out dip
switches<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> ones<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.850> set

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
switches and so not the ones you can set

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.160 
switches and so not the ones you can set
the<00:02:00.090> code<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:01.469> uses<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.920> same<00:02:02.219> board<00:02:02.640> as
