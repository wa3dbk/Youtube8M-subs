00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.360
 our experience with the vehicles euro 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.880
 6 are very positive 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.130
 you are very good of sonic gentleman 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 fine to drive where they used to be 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 â‚¬ 5 45 km h, the mountains moved up 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.660
 they're definitely over with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.670
 50 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.800
 After all, we regularly buy vehicles 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 but of course you have hard facts 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
 decided on the purchase of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.399
 product and there had clearly 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 at least this year again 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.249
 nose in front because not convinced of euro 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.139
 6 vehicles to the euro companies 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.139
 a very high torque 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.000
 always one could us with the euro 6 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.920
 vehicle with the fishing small one 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.840
 to provide something from the vehicle 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.730
 self-weight and thereby of the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.860
 payload we can use very much 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.750
 good is and still no drawbacks 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.350
 quality and comfort for the driver 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.350
 means 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.560
 At the end, brand saw the price 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 performance really very competitive 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.320
 is 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.240
 especially in times like this where it is 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 becoming more difficult becomes qualified 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.660
 to get staff 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.820
 This extremely important to the driver 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.070
 to be able to offer the speaker of the tool 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.060
 with the fuel consumption we are 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.210
 very satisfied 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.500
 We drive in our lecture vehicles 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 Line traffic in light traffic 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.990
 with 22 5 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.780
 fuel consumption and heavy 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 use with 31 5 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.229
 we promise extra here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.689
 Safety tool for our motorist 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.869
 around him in hazardous situations on 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.380
 To avoid accidents 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.119
 They have been driving in the fleet for a long time 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.549
 and see you now in the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.959
 Decision confirmed because the 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.609
 Consumption in about five percent 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.670
 lower so we are then 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.869
 In terms of tank it reaches the largest possible ranges 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 absolutely only advantages 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.880
 that's not what lived 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.490
 feel that here yet again a 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.770
 ballet jump was made upwards 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.770
 So overall, we are very satisfied 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.370
 the product you from that very 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.770
 few workshop visits need if the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 Close cooperation continues because 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.710
 she sure is the next one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.310
 years , m1 will need change and 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.310
 will be 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.720
 I am convinced that you are so 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.790
 very confident in the transport 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.790
