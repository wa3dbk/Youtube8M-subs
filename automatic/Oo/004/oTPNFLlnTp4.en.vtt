00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.160
 moment receiving the Lord something that 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.980
 maybe I 've thought about it but I have not 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 expressed 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.130
 we have three cameramen here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.369
 the floor manager we have people who 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 works in different the different 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.689
 teams 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.480
 and someday the gentleman is going to tell you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.700
 they 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.379
 you can be a faithful alleluia you have served 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.079
 you were not an evangelist who 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.820
 you stopped on the platforms and that has 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.970
 spoken in the world 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.250
 but you were true 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.760
 and you were an instrument so that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.790
 thousands and millions came at the feet of 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 christ flowers 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.760
 sir once said no one have in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 little your youth 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.810
 do not overlook the one who does the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.480
 chores maybe with cables maybe 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.480
 with cameras maybe with microphones 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.560
 but you are being faithful 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.880
 and you will have the pleasure of the Lord 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.400
 and maybe in the presence of god they go 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.990
 to be feeling more joy than a 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.770
 evangelist or that a great shepherd 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.850
 because the Lord has crowned your 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.850
 ours to the water 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.470
 God has nice things to reveal to us 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.750
 when we see him 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.120

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:59.690
 or 22 stations 22 nations 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.530
 or the new chains that come 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.270
 let's have a real and true vision of 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.149

 we believe that the neighborhood a study 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.260
 is to clean a camera 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.459

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.459

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.510
