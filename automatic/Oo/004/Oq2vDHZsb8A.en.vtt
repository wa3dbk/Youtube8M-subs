00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.080
 Do not try to produce waves 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.640
 but ride the waves. 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.760
 This was our slogan at 24-7 Prayer right from the start. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.520
 As we approach our 15th anniversary, I remember the different waves, 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 we had surfed and how much fun we had had, how wild this ride was. 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.240
 I remember the first prayer room and how it multiplied and continued to grow. 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.820
 We are growing faster now than ever before. 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.660
 I remember the first mission team that we sent to Ibiza 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 and how Rollingstone magazine and channel 4 turned up to film a documentary. 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.780
 How we send mission teams all over the world now. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.240
 I remember the first boiler room in a pub 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.120
 and dozens of these boiler room communities, and new missional, monastic communities 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.140
 originated all over the world. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.400
 Remember, we have always had a heart for unity, 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.580
 does not surprise the present opportunity. The following happened: 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720
 Cardinal SchÃ¶nborn, one of the people who helped elect the Pope, 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.080
 has officially invited us as 24-7 to host our next meeting here in Vienna. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.640
 One of the coolest cities in the world. 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.380
 It's getting wild and weird together with free-churchers, crazy people and Catholics, 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.560
 BUT we know that this is the Holy Spirit 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.820
 because one of the unanswered prayers of Jesus is that the church is united. 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.920
 It is important that we get together, because the Bible is full of festivals and festivals, 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.020
 to which people often come from far away and spare no expense to be together 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.280
 and celebrate the story of God. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.540
 Whether you're new to 24-7 and just want to connect, you're welcome 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 or if you've been there for 15 years - It's time to get together again 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.680
 and to celebrate our birthday. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.480
 We expect many wonderful new things to come, 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.780
 incredible visions that God gives us, exciting opportunities, far beyond that, 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.760
 what we asked or dreamed for. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.360
 That's why in 2015, come to Vienna for the 15th anniversary of 24-7 prayer. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.920
 Together we celebrate what God has given, knowing that God is with us as never before 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.680
 and vision together about our new future. 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.040
 Come and celebrate with us our 15th birthday 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.480
 Vienna 15 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.560
 The vision is still Jesus
