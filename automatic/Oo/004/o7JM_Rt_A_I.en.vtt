00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.830

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.370
 games from the back of the disc 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.520
 hulk hogan chapter 2 how are you already 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.120

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.850
 we can open the packaging and as you see 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.490

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.570

 Dwayne Johnson on Daniel Brian 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.230
 I'm such a life and make it a sin and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.560
 that nothing else is interesting about it 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.550
 normal edition only instruction and this 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.190
 That piece of paper with the code on dlc a couple of words 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.590
 About this game this is certainly not a review 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.540
 so I will not talk much in 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.800

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.920

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.870
 you can no longer speak further 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.080
 would rather have it become available 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.520
 addition with c code steiner I can 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.130
 recreate them not battle 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.730
 goal bergson steiner for the title and more 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.150
