here we go branding promotes of fire

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.820 
here we go branding promotes of fire
look<00:00:05.970> at<00:00:06.089> all<00:00:06.180> those<00:00:06.299> fire<00:00:06.629> elementals<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.680> are

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
look at all those fire elementals we are

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.919 
look at all those fire elementals we are
in<00:00:07.980> blades<00:00:08.309> edge<00:00:08.610> mountains<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.750> the

the map but once you walk into that area
you'll<00:00:20.310> see<00:00:20.400> your<00:00:20.699> map<00:00:20.880> your<00:00:21.180> little<00:00:21.769> above

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
you'll see your map your little above

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859 
you'll see your map your little above
your<00:00:23.090> mini-map<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.330> tell<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> you're

your mini-map will tell you that you're
in<00:00:24.990> sculled<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> scalding<00:00:27.420> hot<00:00:27.570> here

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
in sculled and it is scalding hot here

in sculled and it is scalding hot here
all<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.230> sudden<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.609> Lee's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
all of a sudden you know look at Lee's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
all of a sudden you know look at Lee's
ferry<00:00:30.000> elementals<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> not

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
ferry elementals and this is not

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.700 
ferry elementals and this is not
actually<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.640> best<00:00:32.880> place<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.690> farm<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.440> grind

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
actually the best place to farm to grind

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610 
actually the best place to farm to grind
for<00:00:35.250> votes<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.030> fire<00:00:36.270> best<00:00:37.050> places<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
for votes of fire best places in the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
for votes of fire best places in the
elemental<00:00:38.129> plateau<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.149> may<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
elemental plateau but you may not have

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.020 
elemental plateau but you may not have
your<00:00:39.780> flying<00:00:40.020> mount<00:00:40.320> yet<00:00:41.210> or<00:00:42.210> maybe<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
your flying mount yet or maybe the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.279 
your flying mount yet or maybe the
elementals<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> elemental<00:00:45.780> plateau<00:00:45.989> are

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
elementals in the elemental plateau are

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.209 
elementals in the elemental plateau are
also<00:00:46.440> higher<00:00:46.770> level<00:00:47.160> they're<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.460> 72<00:00:47.940> 72<00:00:49.219> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
also higher level they're like 72 72 so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
also higher level they're like 72 72 so
you<00:00:50.280> may<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.730> come<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.660> makes

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you may want come out here what makes

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.380 
you may want come out here what makes
this<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.219> little<00:00:53.219> bit<00:00:53.460> tough<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.239> also

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
this a little bit tough is that you also

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.970 
this a little bit tough is that you also
have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> kill<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:55.199> imps<00:00:55.559> while<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.890> at

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
have to kill some imps while you're at

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.319 
have to kill some imps while you're at
it<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.789> there's<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.149> fire

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it but you can see there's just fire

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
it but you can see there's just fire
elementals<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> place<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.879> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
elementals all over the place now you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
elementals all over the place now you
may<00:01:00.180> ask<00:01:00.359> why<00:01:00.690> bother<00:01:01.079> grinding<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.800> motes<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
may ask why bother grinding for motes of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.509 
may ask why bother grinding for motes of
any<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.480> place<00:01:03.629> because

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
any kind in the first place because

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
any kind in the first place because
isn't<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.900> wrath<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> lich<00:01:07.229> king<00:01:07.350> now

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
isn't the wrath of the lich king now

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.120 
isn't the wrath of the lich king now
being<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.090> thing<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.540> for

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
being out is the thing to go for

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.880 
being out is the thing to go for
crystals<00:01:11.130> well<00:01:11.729> yes<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.140> couple<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.860> things

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
crystals well yes but a couple of things

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
crystals well yes but a couple of things
for<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.460> thing<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.700> may<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.060> high<00:01:15.210> enough

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
for one thing you may not be high enough

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.499 
for one thing you may not be high enough
level<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.770> wintergrasp<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.790> get

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
level to be out in wintergrasp you get

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.090 
level to be out in wintergrasp you get
up<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> level<00:01:18.840> 80<00:01:19.170> before<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.799> grind

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
up to level 80 before you go grind

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
up to level 80 before you go grind
winter<00:01:20.400> grass<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.509> creatures

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
winter grass because all the creatures

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
winter grass because all the creatures
in<00:01:22.020> wintergrasp<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.680> level<00:01:23.040> 80<00:01:23.360> especially

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
in wintergrasp are level 80 especially

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.910 
in wintergrasp are level 80 especially
you<00:01:24.450> only<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> grind<00:01:25.049> wintergrasp<00:01:25.590> for

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you only want to grind wintergrasp for

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.490 
you only want to grind wintergrasp for
crystals<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:27.000> faction<00:01:27.509> has<00:01:27.960> control<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
crystals if your faction has control of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
crystals if your faction has control of
winter<00:01:28.860> grass<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
winter grass and then you can see the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350 
winter grass and then you can see the
revenants<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> revenants<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:32.909> level<00:01:33.150> 80

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
revenants and the revenants are level 80

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840 
revenants and the revenants are level 80
but<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:34.140> twice<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.530> hit<00:01:34.920> points<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
but they have twice the hit points of a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
but they have twice the hit points of a
regular<00:01:36.090> elemental<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.829> also<00:01:37.979> have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
regular elemental and they also have

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
regular elemental and they also have
that<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:38.970> also<00:01:39.090> hit<00:01:39.329> harder<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> need<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that they also hit harder so you need to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.800 
that they also hit harder so you need to
be<00:01:40.770> level<00:01:41.070> 80<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.670> pretty<00:01:42.240> well<00:01:42.329> geared

is<00:01:50.189> they<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.790> hundred<00:01:51.149> percent<00:01:51.180> drop

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
is they have a one hundred percent drop

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
is they have a one hundred percent drop
rate<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.140> crystals<00:01:52.649> every<00:01:53.100> cut<00:01:53.250> time<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.520> kill

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
rate of crystals every cut time you kill

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.800 
rate of crystals every cut time you kill
a<00:01:53.729> revenant<00:01:54.060> you're<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> crystal

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
a revenant you're going to get a crystal

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
a revenant you're going to get a crystal
plus<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:55.890> other<00:01:55.979> loot<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> time

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
plus some other loot a lot of the time

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 
plus some other loot a lot of the time
but<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.020> say<00:01:58.200> their<00:01:58.409> level<00:01:58.710> 80<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> they

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
but like I say their level 80 and they

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.209 
but like I say their level 80 and they
have<00:01:59.850> twice<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.270> hit<00:02:00.659> points<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.770> standard

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
have twice the hit points of a standard

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.510 
have twice the hit points of a standard
elemental

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
elemental

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.639 
elemental
but<00:02:03.909> anyway<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:04.930> when<00:02:05.140> you're<00:02:05.289> when<00:02:05.560> you're

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
but anyway so when you're when you're

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.460 
but anyway so when you're when you're
level<00:02:05.890> 80<00:02:06.070> go<00:02:06.280> grinding<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.939> wintergrasp<00:02:07.470> I'm

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
level 80 go grinding in wintergrasp I'm

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.930 
level 80 go grinding in wintergrasp I'm
waiting<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.769> see<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.129> first<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.580> haven't<00:02:09.789> seen

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
waiting to see the first we haven't seen

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.089 
waiting to see the first we haven't seen
a<00:02:09.970> fire<00:02:10.509> drop<00:02:10.840> yet<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.500> I'm<00:02:11.620> having<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.890> little

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
a fire drop yet so I'm having a little

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.059 
a fire drop yet so I'm having a little
bit<00:02:12.220> mad<00:02:12.430> look<00:02:12.640> here<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.780> my<00:02:13.930> point<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.379> that

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
bit mad look here so my point is that

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.800 
bit mad look here so my point is that
you<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.879> high<00:02:16.030> level<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.450> got<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.720> get

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you have to be high level you got to get

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.420 
you have to be high level you got to get
up<00:02:16.900> level<00:02:17.170> 80<00:02:17.349> before<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.800> can<00:02:17.950> effectively

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
up level 80 before you can effectively

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.979 
up level 80 before you can effectively
grind<00:02:18.849> for<00:02:19.060> crystals<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.690> there's<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
grind for crystals because there's a

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.680 
grind for crystals because there's a
place<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.349> do<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.950> wintergrasp<00:02:21.690> so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
place to do that is in wintergrasp so

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.089 
place to do that is in wintergrasp so
you<00:02:22.750> may<00:02:22.900> not<00:02:23.080> be<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.319> high<00:02:23.440> level<00:02:23.739> yet<00:02:23.920> but

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
you may not be that high level yet but

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.910 
you may not be that high level yet but
the<00:02:24.190> other<00:02:24.340> thing<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:25.629> here<00:02:26.349> you'll<00:02:26.560> finally<00:02:26.769> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
the other thing it here you'll finally a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.440 
the other thing it here you'll finally a
moat<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.459> fire<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.000> that's<00:02:28.180> what<00:02:28.330> we're

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
moat of fire so that's what we're

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.140 
moat of fire so that's what we're
looking<00:02:28.690> for<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.769> see<00:02:29.980> because<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.060> many

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
looking for you see because so many

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.030 
looking for you see because so many
people<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.629> dashed<00:02:31.959> out<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.319> northrend<00:02:32.769> are

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
people have dashed out to northrend are

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.830 
people have dashed out to northrend are
not<00:02:33.160> paying<00:02:33.370> attention<00:02:33.459> paying<00:02:34.269> attention<00:02:34.690> to

way out to be doing the hard work of
grinding<00:02:57.700> level<00:02:57.970> 80<00:02:58.180> monsters<00:02:58.750> when<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
grinding level 80 monsters when you

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.740 
grinding level 80 monsters when you

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
could be grinding level 68 level 70

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.410 
could be grinding level 68 level 70
monsters<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.410> make<00:03:03.280> an<00:03:03.400> actually<00:03:03.730> more<00:03:04.000> gold

because people are neglecting the moats

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.970 
because people are neglecting the moats
and<00:03:06.989> their<00:03:07.989> folks<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.380> still<00:03:08.560> need<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.769> buy<00:03:08.920> the
