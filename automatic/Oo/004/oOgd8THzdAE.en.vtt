Mega Man 2 you know what I am in twos

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.170 
Mega Man 2 you know what I am in twos
the<00:02:22.859> first<00:02:23.069> Megaman<00:02:23.459> game<00:02:23.609> I<00:02:23.730> played<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the first Megaman game I played the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270 
the first Megaman game I played the
flash<00:02:24.420> man<00:02:24.659> stage<00:02:24.959> was<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.230> first<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.829> remember

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
flash man stage was the first I remember

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.619 
flash man stage was the first I remember
you<00:02:26.400> telling<00:02:26.549> me<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.909> ever<00:02:27.060> played<00:02:27.329> yeah

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.709 
you telling me that I ever played yeah
yeah<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.319> think<00:02:28.469> Megaman<00:02:29.010> 2<00:02:29.219> is<00:02:29.760> probably<00:02:30.299> the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
yeah I think Megaman 2 is probably the

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.149 
yeah I think Megaman 2 is probably the
best<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.200> there's<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.439> lot<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.680> discussion

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
best but there's a lot of discussion

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.830 
best but there's a lot of discussion

maybe<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.500> more<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.980> end<00:02:38.159> levels

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
maybe a little more to the end levels

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.759 
maybe a little more to the end levels
was<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.879> meant<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.389> the<00:02:39.510> introduced<00:02:39.870> rush<00:02:40.079> was

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
was it meant for the introduced rush was

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.399 
was it meant for the introduced rush was

lot of innovations so I think there's a
there's<00:02:45.780> some<00:02:46.019> debate<00:02:46.290> about<00:02:46.439> letting<00:02:46.799> no<00:02:46.919> oh

maybe<00:03:40.500> trite<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.310> say<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.699> it's<00:03:42.299> The<00:03:42.449> Legend

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
maybe trite to say but it's The Legend

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.659 
maybe trite to say but it's The Legend
of<00:03:42.810> Zelda<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.349> it's<00:03:43.680> not<00:03:43.829> just<00:03:44.069> because<00:03:44.459> it's

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
of Zelda and it's not just because it's

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.119

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
my brother's 3 you can't deny that this

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.410 
my brother's 3 you can't deny that this
is<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.470> classic<00:04:54.980> it<00:04:55.100> is<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.220> masterpiece<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:56.300> in

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
is a classic it is a masterpiece but in

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.060 
is a classic it is a masterpiece but in
my<00:04:56.570> opinion<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:57.140> think<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.560> there<00:04:57.680> were<00:04:57.770> too

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
my opinion I think that there were too

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.100 
my opinion I think that there were too
many<00:04:58.190> levels<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.390> was<00:04:59.540> not<00:04:59.990> that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
many levels and it it was not that

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.270 
many levels and it it was not that
that's<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.350> bad<00:05:00.380> thing<00:05:00.650> but<00:05:00.800> too<00:05:00.950> many<00:05:01.130> levels

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
that's a bad thing but too many levels

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.470 
that's a bad thing but too many levels
for<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.550> game<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:01.730> doesn't<00:05:02.060> have<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.180> save

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
for a game that doesn't have a save

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.330 
for a game that doesn't have a save
feature<00:05:02.750> oh<00:05:03.170> that's<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.740> made<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:03.980> hard<00:05:04.190> to

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
feature oh that's so it made it hard to

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.590 
feature oh that's so it made it hard to
really<00:05:04.520> enjoy<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.970> later<00:05:05.150> levels<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.570> I

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
really enjoy the later levels and I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.270 
really enjoy the later levels and I
think<00:05:05.630> they<00:05:05.900> fixed<00:05:06.530> this<00:05:06.620> problem<00:05:06.770> with<00:05:07.040> Super

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
think they fixed this problem with Super

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.940 
think they fixed this problem with Super
Mario<00:05:07.340> World<00:05:07.580> yes<00:05:08.480> where<00:05:08.660> suddenly<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.470> have

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
Mario World yes where suddenly you have

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.530 
Mario World yes where suddenly you have
all<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.280> levels<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:10.880> also<00:05:11.030> have<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.300> safe

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
all the levels but you also have a safe

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.570 
all the levels but you also have a safe
feature<00:05:11.780> yes<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:12.470> now<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.190> is<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.550> a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
feature yes so now is this is that a

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.760 
feature yes so now is this is that a
really<00:05:13.880> a<00:05:13.910> problem<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.660> don't<00:05:14.930> know<00:05:15.110> this<00:05:15.320> this

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
really a problem I don't know this this

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.710 
really a problem I don't know this this
is<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:16.040> master<00:05:16.669> they're<00:05:17.090> beautiful<00:05:17.450> but<00:05:17.660> I

is a master they're beautiful but I

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.240 
is a master they're beautiful but I
think<00:05:17.990> so<00:05:18.260> many<00:05:18.380> people<00:05:18.740> put<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.010> as<00:05:19.220> number

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
think so many people put this as number

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.370 
think so many people put this as number
one<00:05:19.700> on<00:05:19.940> their<00:05:20.150> all-time<00:05:20.390> list<00:05:20.750> yep<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.290> I'm

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
just not one of them I think there's a

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.880
