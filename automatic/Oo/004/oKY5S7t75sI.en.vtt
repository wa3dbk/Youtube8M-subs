00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.470 
but yet you can actually cover the whole
map<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.830> trade<00:02:33.130> anything<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.030> shoot<00:02:34.270> down

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
map in this trade anything a shoot down

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.670 
map in this trade anything a shoot down
on<00:02:34.630> people<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.950> like<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.440> or<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> can

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
on people just like so or you can

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.870 
on people just like so or you can
detonate<00:02:38.890> as<00:02:39.250> well<00:02:39.459> oh<00:02:39.720> damn<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:41.260> know<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.880> at

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
detonate as well oh damn it know that at

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.520 
detonate as well oh damn it know that at
speed<00:02:43.150> balance<00:02:45.720> goes<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.989> whole<00:02:47.140> map<00:02:47.380> and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
speed balance goes on the whole map and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
speed balance goes on the whole map and
drops<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.920> back<00:02:48.100> here<00:02:48.340> I'm<00:02:48.760> guessing<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.330> can
