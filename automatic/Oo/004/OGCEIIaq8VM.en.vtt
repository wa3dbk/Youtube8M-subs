00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.009
 hello everyone welcome to the saffron yellow kitchen today we prepare together 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.869
 the profiteroles a sweet as gluttonous as it is spectacular 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.960
 it is a dessert made up of many small denials 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.169
 filled with chantilly cream and covered with chocolate cream but let's see in are 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.649
 the ingredients that are needed to prepare it 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.490
 100 30 grams of flour 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 4 medium eggs a teaspoon of sugar 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.990
 100 grams of butter at room temperature 2 tablespoons of icing sugar 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.940
 phrases 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.240
 the 100 1000 liters of water twenty thousand liters of fresh whole milk a pinch 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.440
 of salt 400 grams of dark chocolate is a liter of fresh cream 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 then we prepare the profitters together 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.290
 first we prepare the pasta to form our own 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.530
 wines in this film I put water to buy sugar and the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.380
 butter 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.920
 I let it all melt and as soon as the mixture begins to boil 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.479
 as you can see we throw away 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.659
 all at once the flour inside at this point we remove the pot from 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.920
 fire and stir until we get a ball 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.969
 the dough 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.969
 one is practically united 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.300
 as you see 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 all the ingredients are kamakama years together 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.819
 Now let's put the mixture back on the low heat 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 and let it dry by stirring until underneath on the bottom of the pan is not 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 you can't do a patina 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.560
 as you can see, the homeland was formed at the bottom of the pot. of which we spoke 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 so now let's turn off the heat we welcome reshuffle from the pot 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 let's put a plate and let it cool completely 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.460
 in this bowl here is my dough which must be completely cold here 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.070
 instead we have the eggs which although I recommend it is very important must 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.169
 being at room temperature I will now add one egg at a time 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.469
 but I will never reach second until the first one has been completely 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.329
 absorbed from the meal 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.329
 so let's start with one 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.389
 map 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.389
 and we mix. until it is completely absorbed 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.049
 I put our dough in a pastry bag with a nozzle 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.569
 smooth and making big piles more or less like a light on 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.729
 a baking pan lined with parchment paper 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.859
 on a pan like this, that is, a baking tin from home, there will be about 30 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:57.519
 then we will have to cook them in a static oven at 220 degrees for 15 minutes we lower 190 e 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.519
 cook for another 10 minutes and then turn off the oven but leave it there 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.869
 oven door ajar maybe avoid with a master you can 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.239
 put inside 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.970
 and then let them dry for another 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.799
 now we prepare the covering of profitterolles in this pot ho 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.689
 put half a liter of cream and milk 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.579
 as soon as the mixture hope for them, we will add the chocolate 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.629
 dark chocolate that we chopped roughly 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.620
 stir until it is completely dissolved and then 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.419
 we will put this mixture in the refrigerator to cool down by thickening 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.879
 each line will be ready and completely absent 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.469
 we can proceed 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.909
 to pierce the bottom of each of them perhaps using the handle of a 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:53.809
 teaspoon 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.419
 in this way 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.129
 when all the wines are ducati we can stuff them filling a. with 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.739
 the chantilly cream was formed by mounting the fresh cream half of you in 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.739
 this case with 2 teaspoons of icing sugar 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.479
 in this way 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:16.549
 when all the wines will be mince and we can also cover them with the 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.419
 transparent film to refrigerate in the church. that the 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.419
 covering has reached the right density 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.719
 once the cream has thickened to the point where it can be covered 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.690
 a business in the room to see the surface below 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.690
 we vote within it one wine at a time 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.580
 let's cover it entirely 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.870
 at this point we can put all the wines on a serving plate you can 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.349
 choose the dish of the formative round valley rectangular bed you hold 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.479
 bill . of the quantity bing bing my 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.599
 and therefore 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.499
 form the first layer then place the others one on top of the other 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.499
 up to form a pyramid 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.680
 surely at first a little Chantilly cream will not be offered because not 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.370
 you have waited all right to fill yours 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.300
 well with that you can make these wonderful bows filling the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.120
 sac a poche with a star-shaped nozzle and here are our marvelous ones 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.450
 saffron yellow profitterolles greeting and the next recipe apples
