it<00:00:00.240> it's<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.260> be<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> lot<00:00:01.589> more

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
it it's going to be a lot more

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.200 
it it's going to be a lot more
complicated<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.520> then<00:00:02.669> chances<00:00:02.820> are<00:00:03.060> it's

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
complicated and then chances are it's

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.599 
complicated and then chances are it's
gonna<00:00:03.300> have<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.480> be<00:00:03.570> slower<00:00:03.959> than<00:00:04.609> anything

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
gonna have to be slower than anything

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.230 
gonna have to be slower than anything
you<00:00:05.700> do<00:00:06.890> so<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.010> other<00:00:08.069> words<00:00:08.309> you'll<00:00:08.910> see<00:00:09.120> how

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
you do so in other words you'll see how

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.330 
you do so in other words you'll see how
quick<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.630> get<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.800> control

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
quick you can get with and and control

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.030 
quick you can get with and and control
everything<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.330> note<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.870> then<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.889> have

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
everything on one note and then you have

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.770 
everything on one note and then you have
that<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.309> sort<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.519> your<00:00:14.639> speed<00:00:14.940> limit<00:00:15.240> for

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that as sort of your speed limit for

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.429 
that as sort of your speed limit for
other<00:00:16.170> licks<00:00:17.180> again<00:00:18.180> an<00:00:18.300> example<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.869> if

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
other licks again an example of that if

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
other licks again an example of that if
you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:21.680> it<00:00:22.680> means<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.010> you're

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you can do this it means that you're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
you can do this it means that you're
going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> probably<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> have

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
going to probably you know not to have

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.349 
going to probably you know not to have
too<00:00:26.250> much<00:00:26.279> trouble<00:00:26.609> doing<00:00:26.880> something<00:00:27.269> a

too much trouble doing something a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.550 
too much trouble doing something a
little<00:00:27.390> more<00:00:27.570> complex<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> same

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
little more complex that's the same

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.130 
little more complex that's the same
picking<00:00:28.830> speed<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
picking speed and you know if you but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.120 
picking speed and you know if you but
you're<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.290> gonna<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.530> able<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> exceed<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you're not gonna be able to exceed that

you're not gonna be able to exceed that
you<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.350> that's<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.680> thing<00:00:43.760> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you know and that's the first thing and

terror death licks one more thing about

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
terror death licks one more thing about
dynamics<00:00:50.030> when<00:00:51.030> you're<00:00:51.149> working<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> lot<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
dynamics when you're working on a lot of

dynamics when you're working on a lot of
these<00:00:51.870> faster<00:00:52.410> licks<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.100> things

these faster licks and a lot of things

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.990 
these faster licks and a lot of things
that<00:00:53.340> require<00:00:53.670> real<00:00:54.090> real<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.850> very

that require real real you know very

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.139 
that require real real you know very
precise<00:00:57.930> technique<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.219> tend<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> sort<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
precise technique you tend to sort of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.849 
precise technique you tend to sort of
have<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> left<00:01:01.079> hands<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.649> doing

have your right and left hands be doing
these<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.190> accurate<00:01:02.760> things<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.420> moving

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
these very accurate things and moving

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.600 
these very accurate things and moving
real<00:01:04.290> perfectly<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.860> everything<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.460> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
real perfectly and everything which is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
real perfectly and everything which is
great<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> sort<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> thing<00:01:07.010> although

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
great for that sort of thing although

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
great for that sort of thing although
try<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> forget<00:01:09.270> there's<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> lot<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
try not to forget there's a lot of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
try not to forget there's a lot of
guitar<00:01:10.200> fields<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.130> cool<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
guitar fields that are really cool that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.499 
guitar fields that are really cool that
are<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.720> looser<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.580> less

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
are a lot looser and have a lot less

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.800 
are a lot looser and have a lot less
efficient<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.409> still<00:01:17.369> cool<00:01:17.610> moves<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
efficient but still cool moves like for

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
efficient but still cool moves like for
instance<00:01:19.100> because<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.460> take<00:01:20.610> three

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
instance because you just take three

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:29.020 
instance because you just take three
notes<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:23.450> something<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:25.369> gacA<00:01:27.049> and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
notes like something like that gacA and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.490 
notes like something like that gacA and
if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> did<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> bill<00:01:31.049> precise

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
if you did it you know the bill precise

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.280 
if you did it you know the bill precise
method<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.490> picking<00:01:32.880> motion

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
method with very little picking motion

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
method with very little picking motion
something<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> times

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
something like that but a lot of times

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
something like that but a lot of times
you<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> rock<00:01:37.020> context<00:01:39.140> sounds<00:01:40.140> really

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you know in a rock context sounds really

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
you know in a rock context sounds really
cool<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.950> actually<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.119> your

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
cool if you actually you know get your

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.639 
cool if you actually you know get your
arm<00:01:42.540> pretty<00:01:42.840> far<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.500> whack

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
arm pretty far up and really whack

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.660 
arm pretty far up and really whack
something<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> almost<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.250> percussive

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
something you almost get a percussive

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.389 
something you almost get a percussive
kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> sound<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.450> lower<00:01:48.659> strings<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> got

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
kind of sound from lower strings you got

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.859 
kind of sound from lower strings you got
to<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:50.579> sure<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.119> sort<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to make sure that you have them sort of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.930 
to make sure that you have them sort of
blocked<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:52.979> go

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
blocked out so they don't go

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.420 
blocked out so they don't go
do<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.590> your<00:01:55.710> thumb<00:01:56.010> on<00:01:56.310> your

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
right and when you hit all the strings

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.290 
right and when you hit all the strings
to<00:02:01.710> get<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:01.920> whack<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.550> really<00:02:02.760> sounds<00:02:03.060> cool
