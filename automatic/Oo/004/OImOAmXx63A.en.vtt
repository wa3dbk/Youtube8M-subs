market but what I'm explaining to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
market but what I'm explaining to
they're<00:01:08.670> more<00:01:08.850> than<00:01:08.970> anything<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:10.010> how<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
front works and basically you can close

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
front works and basically you can close
all<00:01:13.920> these<00:01:14.100> panels<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.510> this<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.930> down

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
all these panels here for this one down

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.130 
all these panels here for this one down
here<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.790> close<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
here and you can close this one here and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
here and you can close this one here and
you've<00:01:19.260> got<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> completely<00:01:19.950> waterproof<00:01:20.280> vivid

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you've got a completely waterproof vivid

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.380 
you've got a completely waterproof vivid
or<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.810> we've<00:01:22.080> done<00:01:22.380> we've<00:01:23.010> let<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:24.150> fall

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
or as we've done we've let the with fall

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
or as we've done we've let the with fall
lit<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> side<00:01:25.020> ones<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
lit up the side ones for that so you can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420 
lit up the side ones for that so you can
see<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.909> mesh<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.360> hot<00:01:27.600> days<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
see the mesh on hot days this one is it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.130 
see the mesh on hot days this one is it
clear<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.119> leave<00:01:30.330> on<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.049> if

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
clear one that you can leave on but if

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.429 
clear one that you can leave on but if
you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:32.240> with<00:01:33.240> also<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.080> make<00:01:34.229> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
you want to with also you can make it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.190 
you want to with also you can make it
completely<00:01:37.130> mesh<00:01:38.130> fronted<00:01:38.700> by<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.780> fitting

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
completely mesh fronted by just fitting

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.860 
completely mesh fronted by just fitting
in<00:01:40.710> its<00:01:41.070> place<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.660> see

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
in its place this and as you can see

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.470 
in its place this and as you can see
with<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:43.230> one<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.920> velcros<00:01:44.550> all<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.330> way

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
with this one it velcros all the way

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.570 
with this one it velcros all the way
around<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> nice<00:01:46.620> little<00:01:46.920> addition<00:01:47.220> there

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
around so a nice little addition there

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.700 
around so a nice little addition there
that<00:01:47.790> comes<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.300> bag<00:01:48.450> free<00:01:48.690> of<00:01:48.810> charge<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that comes in the bag free of charge you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.500 
that comes in the bag free of charge you
also<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.370> bag<00:01:50.550> get<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> full<00:01:51.270> set<00:01:51.480> of

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
also in the bag get a full set of

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.980 
also in the bag get a full set of
top-quality<00:01:52.310> baby<00:01:53.310> pegs<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:54.840> can

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
top-quality baby pegs as it as you can

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
top-quality baby pegs as it as you can
see<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.440> on<00:01:55.560> concrete<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.659> just

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
see this is on concrete and it just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.530 
see this is on concrete and it just
obviously<00:01:59.010> all<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.820> don't<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.360> see

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
obviously all the way don't you can see

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
obviously all the way don't you can see
pegging<00:02:00.930> points<00:02:01.970> these<00:02:02.970> are<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:04.740> keep<00:02:05.370> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
pegging points these are to keep it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
pegging points these are to keep it
extra<00:02:05.729> rigid<00:02:06.300> now<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.960> doesn't<00:02:07.260> actually<00:02:07.320> come

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
extra rigid now it doesn't actually come

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.749 
extra rigid now it doesn't actually come
with<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> doesn't<00:02:08.640> really

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
with these because it doesn't really

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
with these because it doesn't really
need<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.479> unless<00:02:10.379> you've<00:02:10.530> got<00:02:10.679> extreme

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
need them unless you've got extreme

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.000 
need them unless you've got extreme
weather<00:02:11.400> conditions<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:13.379> pegs<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.830> long

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
weather conditions the pegs are long

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.280 
weather conditions the pegs are long
keep<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.150> share<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.110> position

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
keep it in this share from this position

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.289 
keep it in this share from this position
but<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.190> want<00:02:17.400> these<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.790> actually<00:02:18.090> sell

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
but if you want these we actually sell

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.750 
but if you want these we actually sell
these<00:02:18.510> separately<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:20.190> these<00:02:20.459> are<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
these separately and these are the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300 
these separately and these are the
spacer<00:02:21.629> bars<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> year<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.099> ribs

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
spacer bars for the year for the ribs

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.280 
spacer bars for the year for the ribs
and<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.030> fully<00:02:24.360> adjustable<00:02:24.480> they'll<00:02:25.049> fit

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and the fully adjustable they'll fit

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.050 
and the fully adjustable they'll fit
ninety-nine<00:02:26.099> percent<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.670> babies<00:02:26.819> over

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
ninety-nine percent of the babies over

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.350 
ninety-nine percent of the babies over
so<00:02:27.959> again<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.680> know<00:02:28.799> it's<00:02:29.370> something<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
so again you know it's something that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.720 
so again you know it's something that
