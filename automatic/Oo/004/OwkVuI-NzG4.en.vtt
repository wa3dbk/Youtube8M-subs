00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.850
 welcome to today's unboxing package 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.349
 or unpacking packages has something 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:18.439
 to christmas in itself and today 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:21.920
 I look at this level control nano quartz 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.920
 to show you 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 the box inside is just that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.790
 quadrocopter and on one side the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.790
 would have to be the transmitter 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.190
 The transmitter is already quite small so 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:58.039
 is reasonably good in the hand 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.039
 but is small 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:12.229
 then we have the quadrocopter here 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:18.259
 also very small in the man going on 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.259
 the only held by rubber bands 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:33.170
 really cute fits the size 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:41.030
 yes then again the points to yes 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:44.440
 what silly inside that seems here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.009
 to be the charging cable 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:54.970
 who attached the word here at the back 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.670
 So then always on the computer load 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:10.239
 and then we do not have a set 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:10.239
 Replacement propellers and the manual 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:19.730
 So here is how to describe 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.280
 the batteries are in the transmitter like the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.090
 Quadrocopter at the computer to load 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.090
 is infected 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.590
 the transmitter and where the quadrocopter 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.680
 be turned on 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.060
 and then just here so the tax commands 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.970
 we react and here you can see 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.530
 the white propellers are in front 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 really good at first so what 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.870
 read through beforehand 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:55.510
 but I will do that afterwards 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.760
 So now we have the quadrocopter here 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.790
 here is the switch right there 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.709
 where also the charging plug 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.510
 is connected then we do the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.510
 at times 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.670
 Now bring because he has no signal 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.709
 from a spark and now we want something 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:30.560
 try out 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:34.159
 this is the sender of this one 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.609
 hub saw quadrocopter and now 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.609
 Let's just go here 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.030
 and behold, they are not flashing anymore 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.030
 leds 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.280
 So that's pretty ag 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.970
 Anyway, so you can see everyone 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.720
 this spark can be the quadrocopter 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:41.010
 also if you are next to the already 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:43.080
 here at home has spark off that 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.240
 here are the batteries the one number 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.240
 Smaller are the walkman batteries 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.350
 come in from me two pieces 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:18.629
 quadrocopter on spark and they as well 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.629
 bound 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:39.089
 So probably for the desk 

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:43.080
 not the best but for the apartment 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:44.719
 for indoor I do not find this size 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.219
 bad 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.800
 so I bought it me 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:55.909
 And if you just compare here 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:01.769
 that hub then he really is 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:03.389
 half the size he thought he was doing 

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:07.379
 have fun 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:11.610
 oh, down here are the whole ones 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:17.239
 soldered components that must be here one 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.239
 board are made of the frame 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:32.930
 the motors are in plastic sleeves in 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:35.060
 this frame put a bit shaky 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.360
 i think with a drip 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:42.100
 Seconds glue can be that too 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.100
 stabilize better 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:52.310
 the battery is here just soldered the 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:56.330
 quadrocopter so do not swap that 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.620
 is called a battery fly charging cable 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.480
 connect to computer or on 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.840
 other charger with usb connection 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.200
 and then you can do that again 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.200
 fly 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.120
 it will not be like that for outside 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.010
 suit 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.480
 and if it is only in village then 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.350
 Can you fly to her then 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.930
 also load again 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.810
 and I also think that the lipo must 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:28.310
 well be a solid rung in here if 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:32.630
 The times should be broken 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:35.020
 certainly possible here that the hood 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:38.270
 I do not want to do that now 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.140
 and to fathom the sweet and then also 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:44.930
 and replace 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.070
 So my conclusion so flown 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.790
 I do not yet properly him 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:52.150
 but here still test-proof appears 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.920
 already quite acted 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.820
 to what extent it will stabilize itself 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.390
 still show 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:04.630
 but I think that's definitely 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.630
 a good buy for indoor flying
