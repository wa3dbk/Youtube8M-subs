00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
for me out of all the mountain houses

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.910 
for me out of all the mountain houses
but<00:00:26.510> all<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:26.780> got<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.020> do<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.140> make<00:00:27.320> these<00:00:27.620> is

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
but all you got to do to make these is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.890 
but all you got to do to make these is
pull<00:00:28.340> off<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.580> top<00:00:28.820> here<00:00:29.060> now<00:00:29.660> it's<00:00:29.780> like<00:00:29.870> a

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
pull off the top here now it's like a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.570 
pull off the top here now it's like a
little<00:00:30.050> indent<00:00:30.530> across<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.950> top<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.430> just

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
little indent across the top and it just

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.640 
little indent across the top and it just
rips<00:00:31.760> open<00:00:31.910> like<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.810> pack<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.079> cheese<00:00:33.380> or

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
rips open like a pack of cheese or

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.920 
rips open like a pack of cheese or
something<00:00:34.060> then<00:00:35.060> you<00:00:35.180> got<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.360> do<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.630> open<00:00:35.750> it

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
something then you got to do is open it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.040 
something then you got to do is open it
up<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:36.170> pull<00:00:36.380> out<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.560> oxygen<00:00:36.920> absorber<00:00:37.430> and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
up and pull out the oxygen absorber and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.660 
up and pull out the oxygen absorber and
then<00:00:39.050> put<00:00:39.260> boiling<00:00:39.530> water<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.130> it<00:00:40.250> or<00:00:40.460> hot

then put boiling water in it or hot

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.850 
then put boiling water in it or hot
water<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:41.060> isn't<00:00:41.300> now<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.480> be<00:00:41.630> boiling<00:00:41.870> that's

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
water it isn't now to be boiling that's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.170 
water it isn't now to be boiling that's
what<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.070> usually<00:00:43.220> do<00:00:43.550> when<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:43.760> let<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.000> stand

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
what I usually do when I let it stand

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.130 
what I usually do when I let it stand
for<00:00:44.600> seven<00:00:45.200> to<00:00:45.320> eight<00:00:45.380> minutes<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.950> it's<00:00:46.760> done

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
for seven to eight minutes and it's done

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.970 
for seven to eight minutes and it's done
so<00:00:48.140> i<00:00:48.170> thought<00:00:48.380> i'd<00:00:48.560> show<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.860> finished

so i thought i'd show you the finished

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.590 
so i thought i'd show you the finished
product<00:00:49.520> here<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:49.850> has<00:00:49.970> been<00:00:50.120> standing<00:00:50.570> for

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600

product here this has been standing for
about<00:00:50.930> seven<00:00:51.440> minutes<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.690> show<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:53.750> what<00:00:53.899> it

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
about seven minutes and show you what it

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.110 
about seven minutes and show you what it
looks<00:00:54.020> like<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.590> mean<00:00:54.950> it's<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.160> quick<00:00:55.340> vid<00:00:55.610> but

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
looks like I mean it's a quick vid but

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.090 
looks like I mean it's a quick vid but
so<00:00:56.450> many<00:00:56.600> people<00:00:56.720> have<00:00:56.989> asked<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.470> thought

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
so many people have asked that thought

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.210 
so many people have asked that thought
I'd<00:00:58.219> better<00:00:58.370> do<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.000> I<00:01:02.920> stir<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> little

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
I'd better do it so I stir it a little

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.980 
I'd better do it so I stir it a little
bit<00:01:04.400> usually<00:01:09.040> there<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.220> chicken<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:10.790> rice

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
really tasty hot really hot but really

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.880 
really tasty hot really hot but really
good<00:01:22.659> weird<00:01:23.659> part<00:01:23.869> about<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.140> rice<00:01:24.320> stuff<00:01:24.650> I

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
good weird part about the rice stuff I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.430 
good weird part about the rice stuff I
guess<00:01:25.369> not<00:01:25.670> weird<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.200> compared<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.290> all<00:01:27.409> the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
guess not weird but compared to all the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.070 
guess not weird but compared to all the
other<00:01:27.590> mountain<00:01:28.040> houses<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.540> leave<00:01:29.750> water

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
other mountain houses if you leave water

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.420 
other mountain houses if you leave water
standing<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.680> these<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:31.250> keeps

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
standing in these it just keeps

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.899 
standing in these it just keeps
absorbing<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:33.710> one<00:01:33.890> time<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.220> left<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.520> stating

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
absorbing so one time I left is stating

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.640 
absorbing so one time I left is stating
for<00:01:35.119> like<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> half<00:01:35.510> hour<00:01:35.750> with<00:01:36.110> boiling<00:01:36.380> water

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
for like a half hour with boiling water

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.649 
for like a half hour with boiling water
in<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.700> forgot<00:01:38.030> about<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.299> because<00:01:38.540> I

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
in it and I forgot about it because I

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.210

garlic powder or sometimes I have lemon

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.050 
garlic powder or sometimes I have lemon
or<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.810> one<00:02:44.469> sauce<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.609> makes<00:02:45.760> them<00:02:45.879> all

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
or a one sauce and it makes them all

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.720 
or a one sauce and it makes them all
better<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.629> I<00:02:46.889> mean<00:02:47.889> it<00:02:48.010> tastes<00:02:48.250> good<00:02:48.370> already

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
but adding something like that gives it

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.979
