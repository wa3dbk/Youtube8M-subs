00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 if you contradict about ebook then 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.990
 you come quickly to two leading 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.519
 namely amazon kindle and tonino 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.410
 true to the motto other mothers have 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.330
 Also beautiful daughters looks computer 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.420
 picture today is a different device 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.310
 namely the pocketbook touch lux 3 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.310
 and I'll introduce them to you now 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.490
 the pocketbook touch lux 3 is about 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.640
 is an e book reader with a 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 six inches big e ink display with 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.720
 a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.930
 The device also offers at the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.570
 bottom next to the usb slot one more 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.699
 bay for external memory cards like that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.470
 that one fixed the 4 gb internal 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.890
 built-in memory arbitrarily build 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.530
 can 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.800
 in addition to clearly recognizable yet 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.390
 four keys to the pocket 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 books three can serve 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.309
 alternatively, of course, is the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.460
 Control via the touch display possible 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.110
 The device is very well processed 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.300
 nothing rattles and nothing wobbles 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.970
 it does not crack on the back either 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.000
 a slightly rubberized surface so 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.400
 The pocket books three are also good in 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.870
 can hold the hand, the device times 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.880
 turn it on and you can already see that 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.500
 Backlight is very much 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.260
 even and shines really well 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.660
 from one of the big positives 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.580
 what else is there to support 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.340
 call there are among other things here 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.110
 menu and if I open it then 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.090
 Here are a few special features 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.740
 Among other things, there are small games here 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.990
 for example, a pension or a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.600
 a chess game or a sudoku 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.260
 built-in calculator and even one 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.690
 rss feed reader for news is natural 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.670
 also a browser on board but like at 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.140
 all ebook like surfing then 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.330
 with such a device actually hardly 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.800
 fun in the displays are simple 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.840
 way too weak and also the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.900
 processor power is enough for fast 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.540
 hardly surf from all interesting is 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.060
 here this dropbox option still if you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.979
 which then activates e books in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.629
 load his blog box at the next 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.030
 start of the pocketbook will be the 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.470
 automatically from the dropbox to the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.800
 reloaded 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.300
 the operation is relatively intuitive one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.099
 has here on the surface the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.400
 different e books you put in 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.739
 By the way, apropos e-books 19 has loaded 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.810
 different file formats can be 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.480
 process pocket books three 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.670
 that's really awesome he knows himself 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.080
 with all common e-book formats 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.990
 So for example paper 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.240
 or pdf only that amazon 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.960
 own awz format he can not 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.630
 to process 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.520
 the operation as I said over 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.390
 a touchscreen or about these four 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.610
 and you can already see the whole thing 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.470
 is a bit leisurely that is 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.600
 one of the few real points of criticism 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.010
 the software is indeed from the surface 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.420
 okay but she could sometimes 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.870
 really be a bit faster 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.390
 yes the typeface very evenly 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.870
 you would be seen by hangover display 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.540
 can now over the pressure on the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.710
 scroll touchscreen 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.810
 Alternatively, I can do the whole thing here now 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.730
 Of course, with the buttons do that 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.770
 is quite handy if I for example 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.850
 the subway is standing and it is just like that 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.260
 I do not have to hold in hand 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.850
 always embrace the touchscreen 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.720
 but this can also be done with the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.270
 control buttons 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.400
 another special feature here is this 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.530
 home button with the cottage if I am 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.840
 a little longer on it I come here 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.160
 on a fast menu here I can 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.320
 for example, the device immediately 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.910
 turn off or make a screenshot 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.400
 activate the wifi 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.489
 apropos the device is only with wifi 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.820
 to buy a umts-version there 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.890
 not the pocketbook touch lux 3 does 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.200
 in the everyday test a really good 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.830
 impression makes fun with the device 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.750
 read 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.130
 except for the really a bit lame 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.940
 There is really little to software 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.200
 criticize 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.700
 the device costs 119 euro that it the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.890
 recommended retail price of 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.350
 manufacturer in the online trade gives this 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.890
 but already for less than 100 euros to buy 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.540
 and how good the device in the lab is 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.220
 We will now find the device 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.360
 is now moving to the computerimage lab 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.459
 there we will take him properly 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.900
 apart as I said in everyday life 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.150
 that a really good figure 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.260
 and I'm curious if he is one too 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.260
 good test note gets
