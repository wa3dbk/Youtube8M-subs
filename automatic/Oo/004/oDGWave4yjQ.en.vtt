00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.100
 Welcome to the latest issue of 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.320
 pixel kitsch again today with a 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.300
 small fast pixel quickie and how 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.020
 you should have already seen it here 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.450
 Today this is a great ironmans 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.040
 go to the clock support 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.750
 I will only play the game in the following 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.750
 still as a super offload call because 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.120
 the license of iron ironman stewart 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.700
 I'm not really interested here 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.050
 the bean comes except in the title too 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.420
 not really in the game anymore 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.280
 So let's focus on the title 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.399
 it's great offroad too 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.469
 1989 common game originally from 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.730
 lilian programmed for the arcade 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.440
 and then has it in the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.140
 following years also on various home 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 computer and consoles managed under 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.999
 There is another version for master 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.799
 System of greed and even the left 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.869
 the left version is probably right 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.270
 should not be catastrophic 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.310
 catastrophic is the s version of this 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.139
 succeeded and was created by 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 rea converted that has the game 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:20.119
 really done well and now offers up 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 the nds even a four player mode 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.810
 very fantastic and these four players 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.060
 Mode is also what the game 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.310
 saved because in singleplayer mode 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.219
 you ride the rounds went the three 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.840
 Computer opponents round by round 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.569
 it really gets into it pretty much 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.779
 length and there will be at the end 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.789
 so tricky at the beginning is it 

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:43.219
 easy to hold on 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.630
 and there the computer opponents but somehow 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.200
 you can always keep up with you too 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.000
 If you 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.920
 have less money available to you 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.570
 buy equipment you can do it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.219
 but always with you again 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.060
 it's a little bit like drawing 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.770
 strange and annoying but in multiplayer 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.460
 Mode with up to four players does that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 really moody 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.659
 as already mentioned you can join 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.909
 money won from the races too 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.960
 buy new equipment you can 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.030
 improve acceleration 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.239
 the final speed the tires and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.080
 the suspension and also you can nitro 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.060
 heat 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.190
 janitos offer you a little one 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.870
 boost this foot is in some places 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.030
 really necessary to ramp over 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.920
 otherwise you get stuck 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.110
 ever quite on how said the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.670
 Computer opponents are also always good with 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.079
 Even though she actually supplies 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.440
 No money at all 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.390
 Well, you can do that anyway 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.700
 play really capricious alone can it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.980
 but also good play the real clou 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.220
 is said to be the multiplayer mode 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.170
 The module is loose for all times around the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.549
 five euros maximum available one 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.069
 complete version beats meanwhile 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.440
 but with 15 to 20 euros to book 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.720
 but this module should be here 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.220
 Actually also do it because the game does 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.930
 is a poll whether it is packaged or 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.579
 not who wants to play can also with 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.250
 a loose module 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.630
 yes as I said immediately I can only you 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.569
 recommend for the multiplayer game 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.840
 highly recommended so have fun 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.840
 the runway 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.849
 OK
