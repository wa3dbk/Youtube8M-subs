00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:12.440
 familiar to me please already in 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.619
 the fourth time I call to report a problem 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.510
 heating here is too hot i'm crying 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.910
 too much for heating 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.930
 although I am never here at night 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.090
 impossible to sleep with this noise in the pipes 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.130
 how much you have to spend to 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.340
 hire a plumber to handle all of these 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.340
 of problems 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.730
 there is an effective solution 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 allowing also lower payments for 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.980
 heat for residents 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.739
 problems that cost you money and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.489
 time is due to 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.489
 imbalance of heating systems 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.720
 let's see how it works 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.550
 follows the path of least resistance and 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.550
 chooses the shortest path 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.070
 in heating systems also happens 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.070
 the most 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.519
 to compensate for this we use 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.100
 pre-setting on radiator 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.500
 valves that provides the right 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.540
 flow through each radiator 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.770
 now the distribution is uniform for 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.590
 each radiator 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.240
 but what happens if the system load 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.460
 will change when people open 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.560
 either close their radiators 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 water is distributed and more flow 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.270
 will go through other radiators 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.829
 to avoid this redistribution 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.189
 necessary equipment is capable 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.009
 normalize consumption automatic 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.119
 danfoss balancing valves 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.119
 designed specifically for this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.860
 This solution will allow you to create 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.760
 balanced and reliable system 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.760
 reduce complaints from tenants 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.030
 you will spend min 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.080
 call processing time and save 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.080
 on commissioning and operation 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.730
 tenants will save on bills for 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.050
 heating 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.560
 thanks to this payback period 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.659
 will be less than two years 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.259
 using the donbass solution for 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.569
 two-pipe systems you can 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.760
 reduce the number of complaints reduce 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.310
 running costs increase 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.220
 indoor comfort and lower payments 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.500
 for heat for residents 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.200
