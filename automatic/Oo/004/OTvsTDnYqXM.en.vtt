00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 welcome people to my 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.520
 little special video a little bit more 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 than a month has finally come 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.130
 the two games finally come in the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.139
 trade 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 to shorten the waiting times 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.980
 we're turning the fans' theories and rumors on 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 to drive the hype further upwards 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.210
 I do that in this video called the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 Ten rumors that please with caution 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.390
 because it is only about 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.590
 Rumored if they were rumored 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.449
 then we learn the truths 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 at the latest in the month or even already 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 in the demo which is old at first and yes 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.410
 I would say let's go with it 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.630
 number 10 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.160
 lambert t will be the team leader 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.149
 in comparison to ruby ​​sapphire it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.500
 differentiate market 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.059
 we now have the sixth because 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.399
 At the start Cowen was the third generation 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 So it would be quite logical if the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.789
 arena people as well as the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.500
 trainer a few of the newer pokémon in 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.670
 pick up the game for your team 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 the most up to date 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.000
 The fighting zone could return, however 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.690
 the league could not provide reliable information 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 give 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 The fighting zone washes pokémons market 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 the most important element in the game 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.629
 I would be so surprised if you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.629
 that would leave out 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 the Ottoman city will be available again 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.260
 his 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.580
 However, it is unclear if this mega 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 development or even be obtained 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.820
 it would not in my opinion 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 make no sense which a mega form 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.100
 to give that in the game elements 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.869
 Pop up 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.820
 you got only starter pokemon 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.229
 as soon as you filled the pokédex I had 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 think it should be a little easier this time 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.380
 be up to it but still 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.790
 I would not understand if that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.710
 would get a megaphone 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 number slevin the posting will be this time 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.950
 bigger the ice after the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 The main story will still have a lot on us 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.079
 get 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 at pokemon rubies and sapphires came 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.170
 then only the tower and the market 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.180
 there was still the fight zone 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.119
 That should not be the case this time 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.799
 so we can look at 19 8 of the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.090
 all sorrow fall so maybe heard 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.130
 the fighting zone but also others 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.720
 scenes and no idea what do you think 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.490
 what else could happen after the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.140
 fruit- or I can think of nothing a degree so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.640
 if any happen from what 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 We could write that down in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 The comments would be very happy 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.790
 numbers 6 megawatt around megrahi 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 the pokémon omega ruby ​​and alpha 4 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.670
 be included that they at a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.530
 Megafon is very likely 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.390
 lies with distance of one of the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 hottest pokémon third john and me 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.629
 would understand if it was a megaphone 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.180
 I would come could me 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.400
 Honestly 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.870

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.569
 depending on the respective demo version 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.310
 you will either get a mega stone too 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.689

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.379
 developments the league due 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.540
 lack of information is certain 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.189
 could confirm league minute could 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.169
 according to him with great probability 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.909
 be programmed and should the typ 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.560
 combination water for as well as one 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.560
 own special defense 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.510

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.699
 Generation should be during developments 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.260
 the remakes as a candidate for a mega 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:36.489
 developments have been discussed 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:38.169
 why sap bo in serious why swat-tal yes 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.060

 some like to be in the new shine 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.269
 it could be a troop 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.849
 megafon tolerated because it is otherwise 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.799
 competitive battle is useless one 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.549
 mega form that could well be something 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.620
 to change 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.759
 logically, that also applies to the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.759
 other useless pokémon 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.360

 abu suhri and houses were not 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.990
 eight candidates are being considered so 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.610
 that a possible development in the 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.130
 play rather unlikely 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:21.930
 what is not only with the epson kids no 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:23.550
 mega truck citizen list i would have the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.030
 He is still decorated and forgot 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.670
