00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:17.208
"All Alone"

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.167
Whoa. What's this?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.542
Awesome! Party!

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:36.458
Find it?

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.083
It's right here. So, who's
responsible for this mess?

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.500
I hate to interrupt, but
can you explain this room?

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.083
Oh, yeah this is all mine. I'll
clean it up in a little while.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:57.542
No, you'll do it now. Then you can hang out.
Your music's not going anywhere.

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.829
Cleaning stuff up and doing
chores is so boring. It really

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:07.566
stinks! If I lived by myself I
could do whtaever I wanted to do!

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:14.500
Instead it's "clean up your trash!
Do your homework!"

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.403
Oh! This is Dad's To-Do List. Buy a
box of pasta, check. Change out the

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:23.482
light bulb in the hallway. He did that.
Ha, what a thrilling life he has!

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.792
"Leave Max alone to do whatever he wants to do."

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.792
I'm all done Mom! I'm just
gonna watch some football!

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.417
Hello?? Mom?

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.375
Hey Alex!

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:10.208
Hey Kid??

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:11.458
Helloo??

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.833
Come on you guys!!

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:15.635
They could've told me where they were going.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.250
Hmm.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:23.333
Pasta and light bulb,
check... Leave Max alone??...

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:26.916
Check!

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:33.833
Really? No way! My wish came true!...
I have the house to myself!

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:39.125
What does this mean?? I can do
whatever I want!!! I'm all alone!

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:47.625
I can call the shots!!

00:02:56.125 --> 00:03:03.208
Hey! I'm gonna eat all of this chocolate pie!
Do you guys mind? Eh? Didn't think so!

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.999
I broke my own record!!

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:32.156
Oh that's just great! This
is my favorite t-shirt.

00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:35.191
I should wash it. Wait a sec!
Why should I?

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.375
That doesn't look so bad.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.417
It doesn't matter does it?

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.875
No man, not at all. You're good.

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:48.855
What's up Max?!... Why are you making that face?

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:52.531
You don't have to worry about things anymore.
See how good I look? (Lick

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:56.482
react) There's nothing wrong with me and
you and I are like exactly the same!

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:59.707
No I'm not like you! We're nothing alike!!

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.797
Hey you're not trying to
get away are you? There's

00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:05.607
a ton of pie left! Oh!!
You want this pop??!!

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:11.667
No cleaning up no one telling you what to do!
We could play in the house!!

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.583
AHHHHHH!!!

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:22.583
That was some crazy nightmare.

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:28.291
Yay!!! You're home!!!

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:30.458
We only ran out to pick up some groceries!

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:36.167
You were sound asleep. We decided not to wake
you, especially after all the... cleaning up...

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.750
What...?

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:46.500
I know I know! I haven't done it yet.
But I'm all over it right away!
