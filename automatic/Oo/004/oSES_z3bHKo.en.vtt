00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
having a go at doing that I was quite

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.969 
having a go at doing that I was quite
excited<00:01:50.569> by<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.170> idea<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.560> somebody<00:01:51.770> was

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
excited by the idea that somebody was

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.010 
excited by the idea that somebody was
paying<00:01:52.279> me<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.639> draw<00:01:52.849> and<00:01:53.509> that<00:01:53.659> kept<00:01:53.899> me<00:01:53.990> going

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
paying me to draw and that kept me going

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.359 
paying me to draw and that kept me going
quite<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.469> while<00:01:54.709> but<00:01:54.859> after<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.219> while<00:01:55.310> I

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
quite a while but after a while I

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.129 
quite a while but after a while I
started<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.819> get<00:01:55.939> really<00:01:56.240> really<00:01:56.479> tired<00:01:56.840> of

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
started to get really really tired of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.019 
started to get really really tired of
trying<00:01:57.859> to<00:01:57.950> think<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.219> another<00:01:58.310> way<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.789> an

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
trying to think of another way to an

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.419 
trying to think of another way to an
Australia<00:01:59.389> Christmas<00:01:59.749> tree<00:01:59.959> so<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:00.709> decided<00:02:01.189> I

Australia Christmas tree so I decided I

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.190 
Australia Christmas tree so I decided I
would<00:02:01.490> try<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:01.819> get<00:02:01.999> into<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.509> editorial

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
would try and get into the editorial

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.120 
would try and get into the editorial
illustration<00:02:04.119> work<00:02:05.119> because<00:02:05.599> that's

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
illustration work because that's

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.889 
illustration work because that's
slightly<00:02:07.130> easier<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.639> get<00:02:07.789> into<00:02:07.999> then<00:02:08.569> then

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
slightly easier to get into then then

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.140 
slightly easier to get into then then
children's<00:02:09.349> books<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.580> reason<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.090> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
children's books and the reason for that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.440 
children's books and the reason for that
is<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.860> editorial<00:02:12.860> which<00:02:13.189> means<00:02:13.459> magazines

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
is that editorial which means magazines

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.530 
is that editorial which means magazines
and<00:02:14.840> newspapers<00:02:15.819> they<00:02:16.819> those

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.600 
and newspapers they those
magazines<00:02:17.870> go<00:02:18.140> out<00:02:18.349> maybe<00:02:18.590> every<00:02:19.040> month<00:02:19.250> every

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
magazines go out maybe every month every

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.640 
magazines go out maybe every month every

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
week even there might be free magazine

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.390 
week even there might be free magazine
there's<00:02:22.609> a<00:02:22.730> lot<00:02:23.000> less<00:02:23.329> money<00:02:24.200> riding<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:24.920> a

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
and of course once you've done one the

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.580 
and of course once you've done one the
other<00:05:57.190> commissions<00:05:57.940> follow<00:05:58.180> because<00:05:58.590> unlike

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
other commissions follow because unlike

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.070 
other commissions follow because unlike
greeting<00:06:00.580> cards<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.259> edit<00:06:02.259> editorial<00:06:02.889> work

greeting cards and edit editorial work

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.129 
greeting cards and edit editorial work
tens<00:06:05.080> of<00:06:05.409> thousands<00:06:06.009> of<00:06:06.069> pounds<00:06:06.310> hang<00:06:06.819> on<00:06:07.150> you

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
tens of thousands of pounds hang on you

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.200

actually<00:06:08.530> delivering<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.159> artwork<00:06:09.610> on<00:06:09.849> time

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
actually delivering the artwork on time

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.610

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
and so they're very funny about actually

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.620 
and so they're very funny about actually
learning<00:06:14.889> new<00:06:15.099> people<00:06:15.490> in<00:06:15.639> it's<00:06:16.090> quite<00:06:16.330> hard

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
to get a wobbly halfway through and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.209 
to get a wobbly halfway through and
decide<00:06:24.669> you<00:06:24.789> can't<00:06:24.969> do<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.560> then<00:06:26.560> more<00:06:26.979> work

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219
