00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
design is stitched by first starting

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.140 
design is stitched by first starting
with<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.049> center<00:00:07.379> circle<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.130> then<00:00:08.880> you're

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
with the center circle and then you're

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.120 
with the center circle and then you're
going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.450> radiate<00:00:10.170> out<00:00:10.410> from<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.710> center

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
going to radiate out from that center

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.660 
going to radiate out from that center
circle<00:00:11.490> with<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.090> flame<00:00:12.450> ray<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.460> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
circle with a flame ray and what that is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.470 
circle with a flame ray and what that is
is<00:00:15.000> basically<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.230> long<00:00:16.529> line<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.480> sharp

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
is basically just a long line of sharp

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990 
is basically just a long line of sharp
stippling<00:00:19.140> which<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.100> another<00:00:20.340> design<00:00:20.730> from

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
stippling which is another design from

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.970 
stippling which is another design from
the<00:00:21.119> project<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.350> you're<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.619> kind<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the project and you're just kind of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.179 
the project and you're just kind of
flowing<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.060> ray<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> edge<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.070> your

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
flowing that ray out to the edge of your

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.490 
flowing that ray out to the edge of your
quilting<00:00:26.550> space<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.960> were<00:00:28.050> actually

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
quilting space if you were actually

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980 
quilting space if you were actually
creating<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> flower<00:00:29.910> design<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.720> could<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
creating a flower design you could of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.990 
creating a flower design you could of
course<00:00:31.019> come<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> point<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.460> create<00:00:32.700> this

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
course come to a point to create this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.139 
course come to a point to create this
that's<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> petal<00:00:34.860> shape<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.940> if

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that's more of like a petal shape but if

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.360 
that's more of like a petal shape but if
you're<00:00:36.270> filling<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:37.020> block<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> best

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you're filling a block this is the best

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
you're filling a block this is the best
way<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> stitch<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.030> you're<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> stitch

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
way to stitch it you're going to stitch

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
way to stitch it you're going to stitch
it<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.280> edge<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.969> then

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it all the way to the edge and then

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
it all the way to the edge and then
you're<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> quilt<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.250> opposite<00:00:44.789> side

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you're going to quilt the opposite side

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.410 
you're going to quilt the opposite side
all<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> way<00:00:45.570> back<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> center<00:00:46.559> circle

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
all the way back to the center circle

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
all the way back to the center circle
you<00:00:48.420> notice<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.050> looks<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.469> lot<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you notice that this looks a lot like

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.139 
you notice that this looks a lot like
stippling<00:00:51.000> only<00:00:51.570> each<00:00:52.100> weekly<00:00:53.100> flame<00:00:53.820> line

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
stippling only each weekly flame line

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.010 
stippling only each weekly flame line
comes<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> point<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.460> echoes<00:00:56.850> back<00:00:57.120> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
comes to a point and then echoes back so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
comes to a point and then echoes back so
if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.800> think<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.730> any

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
if you want to think of it as really any

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
if you want to think of it as really any
design<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.559> stippling<00:01:02.190> only

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
design think of it as stippling only

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
design think of it as stippling only
with<00:01:02.789> sharp<00:01:03.180> points<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> end<00:01:04.500> rather<00:01:05.100> than

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
with sharp points at the end rather than

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
with sharp points at the end rather than
a<00:01:05.580> curved<00:01:05.930> end<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:08.119> really<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> flame

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a curved end and really to do the flame

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
a curved end and really to do the flame
ray<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.310> start

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
ray you can see that I kind of start

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
ray you can see that I kind of start
kind<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> wide<00:01:12.869> coming<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.670> I'm

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
kind of wide coming back and then I'm

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
kind of wide coming back and then I'm
gradually<00:01:15.630> bringing<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> way

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
gradually bringing that in so that way

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.760 
gradually bringing that in so that way
it<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.850> array<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.659> radiates<00:01:19.530> out

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it is actually array it radiates out

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.969 
it is actually array it radiates out
from<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.310> skinny<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.360> wide<00:01:21.979> whenever

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
from very skinny to very wide whenever

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.310 
from very skinny to very wide whenever
it<00:01:23.130> reaches<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> edges<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.990> quilting

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it reaches the edges of the quilting

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
it reaches the edges of the quilting
space<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.009> helps<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> fill<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
space and that helps to fill the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
space and that helps to fill the
quilting<00:01:27.420> space<00:01:27.689> completely<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
quilting space completely this is a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
quilting space completely this is a
fairly<00:01:30.030> easy<00:01:30.210> design<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.049> started<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
fairly easy design it is started in the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.080 
fairly easy design it is started in the
middle<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.009> your<00:01:32.100> quilting<00:01:32.430> space<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.970> of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
middle of your quilting space so of

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
middle of your quilting space so of
course<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.900> does<00:01:34.110> require<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.530> thread<00:01:34.979> break<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
course it does require a thread break in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
course it does require a thread break in
order<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:35.880> started<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.170> very

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
order to get started but it's a very

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
order to get started but it's a very
simple<00:01:37.770> design<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.640> work<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
simple design and it can work in the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.929 
simple design and it can work in the
nice<00:01:39.390> open<00:01:39.990> areas<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.740> quilt<00:01:41.009> fill<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
nice open areas of your quilt fill it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.420 
nice open areas of your quilt fill it
with<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.420> beautiful<00:01:42.630> texture<00:01:43.430> when

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
with some very beautiful texture when

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.389 
with some very beautiful texture when
you<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> last<00:01:45.420> flame<00:01:46.290> ray<00:01:46.649> you're

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you get to the last flame ray you're

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.429 
you get to the last flame ray you're
going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
going to want to kind of but this in and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.090 
going to want to kind of but this in and
fit<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> together<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.799> one<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
fit this together with the one and it's
