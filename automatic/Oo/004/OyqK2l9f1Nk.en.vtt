00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.100
 In this video we will make some truffles that are delicious ... 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.100
 They are simple, easy to make 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
 and appetizing at any time 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.740
 These are the ingredients 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.440
 you have the list at the end of the video and on the website 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.820
 We put to heat the juice of an orange 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.300
 we add the sugar, about 50 grams 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.780
 stir and wait for it to boil 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520
 it's already boiling ... now 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.980
 lower the heat and put over medium heat 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.460
 Stirring occasionally... 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 While we melt the chocolate 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.860
 today we do it in the microwave 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.620
 At intervals of 30 seconds we melt the chocolate and butter 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 We will remove and remove in each interval. 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 And here we have it 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.700
 we booked it while we finished the orange syrup ... 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.100
 You see that it has reduced and is creamy 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.800
 it's time to remove it from the fire 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.820
 I wanted to show you in more detail ... 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.240
 this is the texture ... 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 Let's prepare the truffles 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 In the chocolate bowl add the half orange zest 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 and the zest of a quarter of a lemon 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 We add the yolk 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 beating well so that it integrates 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.300
 We take a good spray of orange syrup 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.200
 we remove ... 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.240
 and finally we add the powdered sugar 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.720
 we are throwing and stirring 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 We throw a quantity, we remove ... 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.080
 and we return to take more quantity 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 This would be the point ... 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 we have it creamy and well integrated 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.740
 Now we reserve it for 20-30 minutes in the refrigerator 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.900
 I'm preparing the tray: we put baking paper 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.720
 on a tray 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.740
 so that it does not rise, we lightly moisten it 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.740
 Chocolate takes 10 minutes to cool 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.740
 and look how it has thickened already ... 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.600
 we'll let it cool another 20-25 more minutes 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 It's been more than 20 minutes 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 and we have thrown the chocolate cream 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 in a pastry bag 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 Let's make truffles ... 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.760
 We will make small piles 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
 and let them rest one more hour in the refrigerator 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.920
 They have already cooled the truffles, 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.600
 Now we will bathe them in cocoa powder: 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.180
 we mix well, we shake the remaining cocoa ... 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.620
 and we put them on a tray. 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160
 I'm using defatted cocoa powder, 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.800
 they could also be made with coconut powder 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
 And here we have them ... 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 you can see it's fast, simple ... 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 and want anytime 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.440
 To keep them, we will keep them in the refrigerator 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.960
 You have the link to this recipe 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960
 in the description of the video 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.060
 And that's all... 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.060
 if you liked the video 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.380
 I invite you to share it and give the "like" 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.200
 Greetings and enjoy these truffles ;-)
