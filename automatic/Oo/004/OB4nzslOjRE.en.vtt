feel<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.360> yourself<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.680> i<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
feel for yourself and but i think that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.440 
feel for yourself and but i think that
there's<00:01:32.280> also<00:01:32.460> people<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.180> show<00:01:33.390> you

how<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> love<00:01:33.930> yourself<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.740> ultimately<00:01:35.310> it's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
how to love yourself but ultimately it's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
how to love yourself but ultimately it's
what<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.600> yourself<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.290> think

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
what you have to do for yourself I think

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
what you have to do for yourself I think
that's<00:01:37.770> why<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.490> people<00:01:38.520> meet<00:01:39.390> somebody

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
that's why when people meet somebody
that<00:01:39.810> brings<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.409> great<00:01:40.740> things<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.220> them

usual I love you that most people tend

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.580 
usual I love you that most people tend
to<00:02:07.950> express<00:02:08.610> instead<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.179> maybe<00:02:09.360> seeing<00:02:09.780> these

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
to express instead of maybe seeing these

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.100 
to express instead of maybe seeing these
other<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.670> great<00:02:11.849> positive<00:02:12.209> changes<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
other really great positive changes that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.370 
other really great positive changes that
are

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
are

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.360

really been a extreme case like that i

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.700 
really been a extreme case like that i
mean<00:03:09.090> i'm<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.480> person<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:09.990> pretty<00:03:10.290> verbal

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
mean i'm a person that's pretty verbal

mean i'm a person that's pretty verbal
with<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:11.670> feelings<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.810> i<00:03:13.020> think<00:03:13.230> that's<00:03:13.410> more

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
with my feelings but i think that's more

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.390 
with my feelings but i think that's more
so<00:03:13.860> lately<00:03:14.160> rather<00:03:15.150> than<00:03:15.420> when<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.690> was<00:03:15.960> like

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
so lately rather than when I was like

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.910 
so lately rather than when I was like
early<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.520> dating<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:19.230> think<00:03:19.800> it's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
early on dating and I think it's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.800 
early on dating and I think it's
exciting<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.700> feel<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.330> love<00:03:21.510> someone

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
exciting to feel like you love someone

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.840 
exciting to feel like you love someone
so<00:03:22.230> yeah<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.640> good

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
so yeah I think that it's it's a good

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
so yeah I think that it's it's a good
feeling<00:03:24.150> when<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.690> say<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.110> or<00:03:25.230> when<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.470> feel

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
feeling when you say it or when you feel

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.200 
feeling when you say it or when you feel
like<00:03:25.830> you're<00:03:25.980> ready<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.340> say<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.550> or<00:03:26.820> when<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.180> i

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
like you're ready to say it or when so i

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.500 
like you're ready to say it or when so i
says<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:28.200> blah<00:03:28.800> blah<00:03:28.950> blah<00:03:28.980> but

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
says it to you or blah blah blah but

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.030 
says it to you or blah blah blah but
ultimately<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.170> lasting<00:03:31.710> effect

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
ultimately it's like that lasting effect

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.980 
ultimately it's like that lasting effect
of<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.880> know<00:03:32.910> are<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.240> saying<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.870> are

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
of you know are you just saying it are

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.670 
of you know are you just saying it are
you<00:03:34.080> feeling<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.210> sometimes<00:03:36.260> mmm<00:03:37.260> like

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
you feeling it and sometimes mmm like

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.350 
you feeling it and sometimes mmm like
the<00:03:37.830> difference<00:03:38.160> between<00:03:38.280> lust<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.940> love<00:03:39.120> is

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
the difference between lust and love is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.580 
the difference between lust and love is
a<00:03:39.900> hard<00:03:41.209> line<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.630> figure<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.050> which<00:03:43.260> side<00:03:43.530> of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
a hard line to figure out which side of

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.020 
a hard line to figure out which side of
it<00:03:43.920> you're<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.220> or<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.390> have<00:03:45.510> both<00:03:45.860> and

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
it you're on or if you have both and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.760 
it you're on or if you have both and
sometimes<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:48.209> only<00:03:48.690> seen<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.410> hindsight

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
sometimes that's only seen in hindsight

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.920 
sometimes that's only seen in hindsight
and<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.270> is<00:03:52.110> i<00:03:52.680> think<00:03:53.690> some<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.720> my

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and so that is i think some of my

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.680 
and so that is i think some of my
experiences<00:03:55.670> but<00:03:56.670> definitely<00:03:57.300> if<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.420> love

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
experiences but definitely if you love

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.850 
experiences but definitely if you love
someone<00:03:57.959> i<00:03:58.080> think<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.410> important<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.830> you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
someone i think it's important that you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.980 
someone i think it's important that you
show<00:03:58.920> them<00:03:59.400> but<00:04:00.150> i<00:04:00.450> don't<00:04:00.690> think<00:04:00.750> you

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
show them but i don't think you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.160 
show them but i don't think you
necessarily<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.950> i<00:04:02.870> don't<00:04:03.870> think<00:04:04.110> that

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
necessarily have to i don't think that

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.250 
necessarily have to i don't think that
you<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.740> say<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:06.000> feel<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.810> or<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.080> mean

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
you have to say it to feel it or to mean

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.590 
you have to say it to feel it or to mean
it<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.920> make<00:04:08.400> sure<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.610> you're<00:04:08.910> showing<00:04:09.480> it

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
it so make sure that you're showing it

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.900 
it so make sure that you're showing it
more<00:04:09.810> than<00:04:10.020> you're<00:04:10.170> saying<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.220> it's

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
more than you're saying it because it's

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.850 
more than you're saying it because it's
