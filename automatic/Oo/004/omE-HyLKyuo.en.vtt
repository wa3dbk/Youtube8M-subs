00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 great bye gamers i think that 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.810
 konsolschiki do not look me after these 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.389
 two rollers the fact is i don't have 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.880
 nothing against the console I just have not 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.880
 I can tolerate people who are being dirty 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.060
 but now it's not about this thing is that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 in hardline already gas is not only one gone 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.160
 out and almost no one in this game 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.010
 does not play 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.590
 why is it so if you are my subscriber then 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.520
 you already know that in the beginning I had 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.410
 good opinion about the new part b 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 small police cards 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 the absence of heavy machinery seemed to be 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.770
 that's where the bad and the game really is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 It turned out very bad after 20 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 hours of gameplay interest in the game disappears 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.449
 cards are terrible shit 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 and all of the above is also 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.539
 cons of this game including the subject 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.480
 you can find less rush hours 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.020
 server players than in the same bf3 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.820
 which came out a few years ago 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.689
 surprisingly true and on consoles 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.570
 situations otherwise there are enough players and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.659
 before throwing shit let me 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.360
 I will tell you why this is so, but the point is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.420
 that at the time of release bf hardline but for now 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 there were already a bunch of alternatives 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 which could be played iso 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.500
 Jesse with a lot of games with the theme of the second 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.549
 world war like red orchestra 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 arma 2 and arma 3 and so on when 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.740
 consoles there was only kolda 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.259
 pf well, what else is there kill zone 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.530
 several games and what can fix 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.140
 I think the situation only if the developers 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 listens to players 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.420
 something will change up to that time 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.969
 everything will remain in place i think 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.670
 what's the main goal of developers to rip like 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.060
 can be more dough 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.610
 they give people pleasure to know 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.680
 most people go back to 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.319
 bf3 and bf4 did so and i just 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.920
 more like to play bf4 than this 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.739
 Hubble and if you buy this game now 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.350
 at least for 20 bucks with a discount you do not 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.569
 buy your purchase 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.510
 I can not imagine how down in you 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.630
 must be to buy premium food 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.130
 mode and not as interesting as it can 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.750
 seem at first glance 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.880
 I play only 4 modes this capture dedmatch 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 heist and blood money 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.090
 Well, I think that 's enough here 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.299
 short vidos blinded on you today 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.890

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.890
