really fast and we slowed down gears to
a<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.470> bit<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.770> terms<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.310> China<00:01:29.550> again<00:01:29.910> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
a little bit in terms of China again to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
make it more accessible and we felt like

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.040 
make it more accessible and we felt like
it<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.870> feedback

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
it you know I think a lot of feedback

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.300 
it you know I think a lot of feedback
we've<00:01:34.320> gotten<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.560> players<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.220> we

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
we've gotten from players is that we

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.440 
we've gotten from players is that we
felt<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.700> were<00:01:35.760> the<00:01:35.940> pendulum<00:01:36.270> swung

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
felt like they were the pendulum swung

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.930 
felt like they were the pendulum swung
too<00:01:36.660> far<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.260> so<00:01:37.650> we've<00:01:38.100> found<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.640> middle

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
too far and so we've found this middle

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:58.190 
too far and so we've found this middle
ground<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.600> found<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.870> sweet<00:01:42.960> spot
