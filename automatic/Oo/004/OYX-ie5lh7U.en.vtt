00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.430 

oh<00:01:13.860> yeah<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> forgot<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.940> that<00:01:15.260> what<00:01:16.260> am<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
oh yeah I forgot about that what am I

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:25.070 
oh yeah I forgot about that what am I
gonna<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.710> about<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.420> let's<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.720> there

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.730 

I've<00:01:25.740> got<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.190> something

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.069 

I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.640> guess<00:01:35.960> it's<00:01:36.960> probably<00:01:38.840> best<00:01:39.840> thing

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
I mean I guess it's probably best thing

00:01:40.079 --> 00:02:05.640 
I mean I guess it's probably best thing
to<00:01:40.229> do

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:21.040 

okay<00:02:06.650> good<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:12.670> did<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> right<00:02:13.910> size<00:02:19.180> no<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.570> just

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
okay good I did the right size no I just

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.510 
okay good I did the right size no I just
thought<00:02:21.230> about<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.920> think<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.430> an

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
thought about this I think I have an

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:33.150 
thought about this I think I have an
obsession<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.600> number<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.530> write<00:02:31.150> again

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
obsession with the number or write again

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:58.620 
obsession with the number or write again
on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.310> other<00:02:34.340> side

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:08.870 

and<00:02:59.530> worse<00:02:59.740> this<00:03:00.100> one<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.830> can't<00:03:03.130> plug<00:03:03.460> this

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.620 

and<00:03:09.480> actually

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.450 

I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.410> might<00:03:13.590> be<00:03:13.710> able<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.160> put<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
I think I might be able to just put a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.310 
I think I might be able to just put a
block<00:03:14.700> here<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.650> know<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.770> wouldn't<00:03:20.130> solve

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
block here you know I wouldn't solve

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:31.210 
block here you know I wouldn't solve
just<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:25.220> perfect

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.920 

and<00:03:33.670> sometimes<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:34.760> mind<00:03:35.030> these<00:03:35.240> two<00:03:35.540> these

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
and sometimes we mind these two these

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.620 
and sometimes we mind these two these
three<00:03:36.380> out<00:03:40.450> there<00:03:41.450> let's<00:03:42.020> do<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:43.450> send<00:03:44.450> in<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
three out there let's do it send in the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.080 
three out there let's do it send in the
water<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.360> hope<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:47.930> works<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.940> the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
water and hope that it works this is the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:06.039 
water and hope that it works this is the
move<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.450> truth<00:03:54.070> nor<00:03:55.070> must

I'm<00:05:44.000> trying<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.330> do<00:05:44.540> here<00:05:44.810> this<00:05:45.410> doesn't<00:05:45.680> this

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
I'm trying to do here this doesn't this

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.469 
I'm trying to do here this doesn't this
probably<00:05:46.580> actually<00:05:46.760> doesn't<00:05:47.180> make<00:05:47.270> it<00:05:47.389> any

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
probably actually doesn't make it any

00:05:47.479 --> 00:06:31.610 
probably actually doesn't make it any
sense<00:05:47.840> whatsoever<00:05:49.630> except<00:05:50.630> for<00:05:50.810> to<00:05:50.930> me

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.010 

and<00:06:32.160> then<00:06:32.340> hopefully<00:06:33.090> you<00:06:33.660> guys<00:06:33.780> are<00:06:33.960> getting

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
and then hopefully you guys are getting

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.760 
and then hopefully you guys are getting
the<00:06:34.260> idea<00:06:34.380> here<00:06:35.720> going<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:36.870> enclose<00:06:37.199> myself

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
the idea here going to enclose myself

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.210 
the idea here going to enclose myself
and<00:06:38.040> glass<00:06:38.600> I'm<00:06:39.600> going<00:06:39.930> to<00:06:40.050> need<00:06:40.199> a<00:06:40.410> lot<00:06:40.830> more

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
and glass I'm going to need a lot more

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.850 
and glass I'm going to need a lot more
glass<00:06:41.729> than<00:06:42.000> this<00:06:44.780> but<00:06:45.780> I<00:06:46.050> believe<00:06:46.440> that<00:06:46.680> it's

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
glass than this but I believe that it's

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.580 
glass than this but I believe that it's
time<00:06:47.130> to<00:06:47.280> go<00:06:47.460> and<00:06:47.840> this<00:06:48.840> is<00:06:49.050> what<00:06:49.260> it<00:06:49.290> will<00:06:49.530> look

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
time to go and this is what it will look

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:57.410 
time to go and this is what it will look
like<00:06:49.740> when<00:06:50.460> it's<00:06:50.669> all<00:06:50.850> done<00:06:54.410> by
