00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.179

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:26.380
 really worry the last sweat yes 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 time so much 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.360
 Oh dear, always on the tip 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.120
 limb pain is also and terms 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.550
 It does not sound like a flu 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.390
 I do not believe so long, however 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.199
 No manger months is the bag moved 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.480
 months he is always terribly tired 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.769
 Eat something different in the old days 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.929
 now they have just is not 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.120
 right 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:02.649
 Not at all such a tasty one 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.969
 hollandaise potatoes 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.440
 I do not know five minutes earlier 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.500
 allowed to stand 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.829
 yes and is afraid of no cake 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.790
 So you know that sounds like it 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.640
 not good 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.880
 but should I always say something my grandson 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.880
 exactly the same 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.909
 but he is like a sparrow and everything does 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.390
 hurt him and sweat this I say 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.780
 them very bad very very bad 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.899
 everyone has and has taken the franz man 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.369
 I like to recognize that more again 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.000
 And this rather search for the motto 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.640
 to let 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.880
 that sounds like my clique 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.210
 there is also this terrible finch around 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.770

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.619

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:00.750
 So really weird 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.750
