I take an eyeshadow brush and I use the
back<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.539> just<00:05:02.020> kind<00:05:02.199> of<00:05:02.289> put<00:05:02.530> them<00:05:02.650> into

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
back of it just kind of put them into

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.670 
back of it just kind of put them into
place<00:05:03.009> and<00:05:03.490> ask<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.449> see<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.720> am<00:05:04.990> pulling<00:05:05.350> them

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
place and ask you see I am pulling them

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.010 
place and ask you see I am pulling them
up<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.160> this<00:05:06.669> just<00:05:06.880> kind<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.240> opens<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.990> eye

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
up and this just kind of opens the eye

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.700 
up and this just kind of opens the eye
and<00:05:08.789> doesn't<00:05:09.789> let<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.000> eyelashes<00:05:10.660> like<00:05:10.900> drive

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
and doesn't let the eyelashes like drive

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.920 
and doesn't let the eyelashes like drive
themselves<00:05:11.979> down<00:05:12.460> if<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.389> get<00:05:13.599> what<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:13.840> mean

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
themselves down if you get what I mean

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.930 
themselves down if you get what I mean
because<00:05:14.919> then<00:05:15.069> that<00:05:15.099> would<00:05:15.250> just<00:05:15.520> close<00:05:15.880> your

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
because then that would just close your
