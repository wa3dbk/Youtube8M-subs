00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
need now to make our assault on the

need now to make our assault on the
final<00:00:17.670> castle<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.270> let's<00:00:18.449> head<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.600> over<00:00:18.720> there

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
final castle so let's head on over there

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:32.380 
final castle so let's head on over there
yes<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:20.880> believe<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.570> over<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.109> way

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.290 

don't<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.540> why<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> missed<00:00:33.900> that<00:00:34.110> shot

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700 

it's<00:00:38.660> not<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.840> good<00:00:39.050> sign<00:00:39.260> when<00:00:39.469> you're<00:00:39.590> just

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
it's not a good sign when you're just

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.260 
it's not a good sign when you're just
walking<00:00:39.920> directly<00:00:40.399> into<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.879> enemy's

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.180 

hopefully<00:00:48.170> we'll<00:00:48.320> pick<00:00:48.530> up<00:00:48.650> some<00:00:48.710> magic

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
hopefully we'll pick up some magic

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.080 
hopefully we'll pick up some magic
points<00:00:49.520> on<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.760> way<00:00:49.880> I<00:00:51.640> don't<00:00:52.640> anticipate

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
points on the way I don't anticipate

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.670 
points on the way I don't anticipate
being<00:00:53.630> able<00:00:53.810> to<00:00:53.960> get<00:00:54.110> through<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.530> last

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
being able to get through the last

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.570 
being able to get through the last
castle<00:00:55.040> in<00:00:55.340> one<00:00:55.490> shot<00:00:55.760> either<00:00:57.160> of<00:00:58.160> course<00:00:58.400> the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
castle in one shot either of course the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.380 
castle in one shot either of course the
first<00:00:58.790> trick<00:00:59.030> is<00:00:59.180> finding<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.750> I<00:01:01.000> do<00:01:02.000> believe

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
first trick is finding it I do believe

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.890 
first trick is finding it I do believe
it<00:01:02.540> was<00:01:02.660> across<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:02.989> river<00:01:07.270> if<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:08.600> can<00:01:08.780> get

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
it was across the river if we can get

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.240 
it was across the river if we can get
the<00:01:09.020> grapple<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.470> attach<00:01:09.740> correctly<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:16.130> was

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
the grapple to attach correctly that was

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.140 
the grapple to attach correctly that was
a<00:01:16.310> close<00:01:16.610> one

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
a close one

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.520 
a close one
that's<00:01:17.990> not<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.440> place<00:01:19.540> let's<00:01:20.540> try<00:01:20.810> over<00:01:20.990> here

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
that's not the place let's try over here

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.950 
that's not the place let's try over here
the<00:01:22.460> final<00:01:22.820> Castle<00:01:23.240> lies<00:01:23.420> near<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.670> near<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
the final Castle lies near the near the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.719 
the final Castle lies near the near the
river<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.680> forest<00:01:28.040> where<00:01:28.220> we<00:01:28.340> fought<00:01:28.550> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
river and the forest where we fought the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.350 
river and the forest where we fought the
first<00:01:28.880> boss

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.180 

I<00:01:37.450> suppose<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.440> could<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.620> crossed<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> river

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
I suppose I could have crossed the river

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.310 
I suppose I could have crossed the river
right<00:01:39.520> there

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.180 

I<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:44.980> believe<00:01:45.310> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.760> place<00:01:46.920> yep

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
I do believe this is the place yep

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.430 
I do believe this is the place yep
now<00:01:48.729> we<00:01:48.790> got<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.210> do<00:01:49.330> is<00:01:49.570> avoid<00:01:49.810> getting<00:01:50.020> kill<00:01:50.409> a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
now we got to do is avoid getting kill a

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.680 
now we got to do is avoid getting kill a
fight<00:01:50.710> until<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.190> get<00:01:51.310> there<00:01:54.390> killa<00:01:55.390> fide

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
fight until we get there killa fide

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.960 
fight until we get there killa fide
motorized<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.650> all<00:01:56.830> sort<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.430> other<00:01:57.700> nasty

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
motorized and all sort of other nasty

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.590 
motorized and all sort of other nasty
things<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.600> could<00:01:58.720> happen<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:59.140> us

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.800 

well<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.750> was<00:02:04.900> stupid

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.720 

and<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.020> was<00:02:13.200> close<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:15.500> let's<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:17.430> right

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and that was close so let's get right

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.170 
and that was close so let's get right
out<00:02:17.970> over<00:02:18.120> here

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
out over here

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.729 
out over here
I<00:02:20.560> believe<00:02:21.560> we<00:02:21.829> have<00:02:21.980> enough<00:02:22.250> for<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.459> powerup

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.170 

from<00:02:27.739> here<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.159> can't<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.549> on<00:02:28.579> without<00:02:28.879> the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
from here you can't go on without the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.970 
from here you can't go on without the
grappling<00:02:29.540> weapon<00:02:29.900> well<00:02:30.379> good<00:02:30.680> thing<00:02:30.829> we<00:02:30.950> got

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
grappling weapon well good thing we got

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.229 
grappling weapon well good thing we got
a<00:02:31.129> grappling<00:02:31.489> weapon<00:02:33.790> all<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.879> gotta<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.209> is

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
a grappling weapon all I gotta do is

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.259 
a grappling weapon all I gotta do is
figure<00:02:35.540> out<00:02:35.659> exactly<00:02:35.900> where<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.530> go<00:02:36.889> with<00:02:37.129> it

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:50.990 

up<00:02:41.269> would<00:02:41.659> be<00:02:41.689> a<00:02:41.840> good<00:02:42.139> strategy

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.229 

almost<00:02:52.000> there

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.740 

and<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.300> think<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.660> gotta<00:02:57.810> play<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.920> flute

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.700 
and I think we gotta play the flute
ocarina<00:03:01.880> pron<00:03:03.200> think

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.380 

and<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:08.250> get<00:03:08.430> ourselves<00:03:08.550> another<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.300> of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and we get ourselves another one of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.899 
and we get ourselves another one of
these<00:03:09.510> overhead<00:03:10.080> levels

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.190 

this<00:03:16.909> one's<00:03:17.150> going<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.569> take<00:03:17.750> some<00:03:17.959> doing

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200
