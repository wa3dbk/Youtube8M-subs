00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
quite quite cool and I think it's just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.600 
quite quite cool and I think it's just
like<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:11.420> gray<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.750> rapt<00:01:13.470> wanna<00:01:13.860> read<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
like a gray with rapt wanna read for it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.749 
like a gray with rapt wanna read for it
and<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.619> cool<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.580> also

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and so that's pretty cool and I also

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.929 
and so that's pretty cool and I also
like<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.119> rims<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.400> spoiler<00:01:20.909> on

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
like the rims of it I have to spoiler on
up<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> looks<00:01:21.930> better<00:01:22.170> with

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
up because I think it looks better with
