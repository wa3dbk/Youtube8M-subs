 in the message of his complicated name the technique is nothing more than the use of 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.430
 plants demolished directly in the soil as a source of nutrients for agriculture. 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.990
 benefits are many pest and disease reduction in good farming 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.000
 productivity of more nutritious food in soil fertility recovery 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.559
 but for this researcher the benefit that gains more prominence is the reduction 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:32.559
 of the cost of production the main economy that hymns importing 70% of 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.909
 all using theses 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.600
 I'd rather go with everything. 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.960
 we are a country the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.300
 but dependent on fertilizers is a matter of even national security ' 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.569
 we can not be a part there the use of fertilizers 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:51.549
 from non-renewable sources, in some cases 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.839
 organic farming our currency fully substitutes fertilizer groups 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.079
 of family farmers in the south of the paraná and colloquiums in Santa Catarina 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.260
 interests 12 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.590
 make the transition from the conventional ecological issue system 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.140
 has user may basalt which is a rock abundant in the region 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
 for the recovery of soil fertility in this field was made 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.780
 with a total balance of 1 percent 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.160
 both in those years the great ones put in the soil 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.060
 according to the embratur technique presents results consistent mainly 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.280
 in tropical countries as in the case of Brazil, because in these countries 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.920
 regions are already worn out by the action of man 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.770
 when by the action of climate and the rubber powder functions as a rejuvenator 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 from heaven what is the emergency room is mutual 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.170
 we are confronted to encourage the use of this alternative 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.710
 brazil to promote the 1st Brazilian congress of rociagem representatives of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.369
 countries like brazil shrimps colombia england exchanged experiences that 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.549
 on the use of the podium shop the main purpose of the event is to re-establish the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.520
 basins for a regulation on the use of this alternative hide solar 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.770
 mainly to bring them together with silo specialists 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.319
 do not leave the coffers of the federal government

 liu xiaobo

 to think about public policies especially for the use of fork wheels 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.589
 there is no regulation yet 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:24.159
 dédé light center of these rocks and therefore they need is p 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.819
 to recreate
