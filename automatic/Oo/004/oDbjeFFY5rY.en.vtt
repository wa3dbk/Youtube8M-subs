in<00:02:13.630> there<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.020> think<00:02:14.230> was<00:02:14.349> that<00:02:14.530> what

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
in there what do you think was that what

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.350 
in there what do you think was that what
is<00:02:15.010> preventing<00:02:15.310> stuff<00:02:15.940> from<00:02:16.060> leaking<00:02:16.270> out

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
is preventing stuff from leaking out

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.030 
is preventing stuff from leaking out
from<00:02:16.420> d23<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.200> they<00:02:17.290> couldn't<00:02:17.530> stop<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.890> well

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
from d23 that they couldn't stop it well

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.410 
from d23 that they couldn't stop it well
I<00:02:18.069> don't<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.459> don't<00:02:18.550> think<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
I don't I don't think it's the it's the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720 
I don't I don't think it's the it's the
level<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.900> douchery<00:02:20.349> or<00:02:20.560> non<00:02:20.709> douchery<00:02:21.310> from

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
level of douchery or non douchery from

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.339 
level of douchery or non douchery from
the<00:02:21.819> fan<00:02:22.060> base<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.569> think<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.140> has

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
the fan base I think that it has

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.839 
the fan base I think that it has
everything<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.739> do<00:02:23.890> with<00:02:23.920> security<00:02:24.370> because
