rules as you go you don't always know

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.400 
rules as you go you don't always know
what's<00:00:19.820> gonna<00:00:19.999> happen<00:00:20.390> when<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.019> director

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410

what's gonna happen when the director
saw<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.710> pencil<00:00:22.310> test<00:00:22.580> is<00:00:22.789> when<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.599> duck

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
saw the pencil test is when the duck

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.630 
saw the pencil test is when the duck
goes<00:00:24.019> off<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:24.499> right<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:24.980> he<00:00:25.039> comes<00:00:25.279> in<00:00:25.490> on

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
goes off to the right and he comes in on

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.669 
goes off to the right and he comes in on
the<00:00:25.789> left<00:00:25.999> you<00:00:26.269> have<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.539> make<00:00:26.720> sense<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:27.380> said

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
the left you have to make sense I said

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.890 
the left you have to make sense I said
look<00:00:28.630> who<00:00:29.630> cares<00:00:30.609> that<00:00:31.609> non-sequitur<00:00:32.509> nature

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
look who cares that non-sequitur nature

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.170 
look who cares that non-sequitur nature
of<00:00:33.020> play<00:00:33.320> is<00:00:33.680> something<00:00:34.130> we<00:00:34.280> really<00:00:34.550> celebrate

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
of play is something we really celebrate

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.480 
of play is something we really celebrate
and<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:35.900> this<00:00:36.350> whole<00:00:36.620> idea<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:37.010> just<00:00:37.100> playing

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
and so this whole idea of just playing

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.460 
and so this whole idea of just playing
how<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.730> want<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.270> really<00:00:38.720> kind<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.050> inspired

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
how you want to really kind of inspired

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:52.360 
how you want to really kind of inspired
us<00:00:39.650> with<00:00:39.830> Disney<00:00:40.220> infinity<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:52.100> we're

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
us with Disney infinity and we're

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.740 
us with Disney infinity and we're
probably<00:00:52.520> gonna<00:00:52.760> punch<00:00:53.060> of<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.360> as<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.570> think

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
probably gonna punch of it as I think

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.410 
probably gonna punch of it as I think
back<00:00:53.990> the<00:00:54.500> genesis<00:00:54.950> of<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.190> toy<00:00:55.520> box<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:56.240> came

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
back the genesis of the toy box it came

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.510 
back the genesis of the toy box it came
from<00:00:56.570> Toy<00:00:56.810> Story<00:00:57.080> 3<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:57.980> wanted<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.340> do

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
from Toy Story 3 we wanted to do

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.920 
from Toy Story 3 we wanted to do
something<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.030> was<00:00:59.150> much<00:00:59.270> more<00:00:59.510> than<00:00:59.690> just

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
something that was much more than just

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.810 
something that was much more than just
kind<00:01:00.380> of<00:01:00.470> that<00:01:00.590> see<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.010> movie<00:01:01.280> play<00:01:01.490> the<00:01:01.640> game

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
kind of that see the movie play the game

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.049 
kind of that see the movie play the game
mentality<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.020> with<00:01:03.890> Toy<00:01:04.100> Story<00:01:04.339> 3<00:01:04.430> showed<00:01:04.879> us

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
mentality and with Toy Story 3 showed us

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.910 
mentality and with Toy Story 3 showed us
is<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.539> all<00:01:05.780> these<00:01:05.990> characters<00:01:06.320> could

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
is that all these characters could

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.279 
is that all these characters could
coexist<00:01:07.249> because<00:01:07.700> they<00:01:07.999> were<00:01:08.060> toys<00:01:08.359> and<00:01:08.780> that

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
coexist because they were toys and that

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.260 
coexist because they were toys and that
just<00:01:09.530> blew<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.070> doors<00:01:10.280> open<00:01:10.640> for<00:01:10.880> us

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
all just discovering what each toy can

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.910 
all just discovering what each toy can
do

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
do

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.190 
do
when<00:01:25.460> we<00:01:25.580> put<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.000> early<00:01:26.390> prototype<00:01:26.930> in

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
when we put that early prototype in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.790 
when we put that early prototype in
front<00:01:27.440> of<00:01:27.530> kids<00:01:27.800> it<00:01:28.730> went<00:01:29.180> crazy<00:01:29.570> we<00:01:30.290> see<00:01:30.590> this

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
front of kids it went crazy we see this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.830 
front of kids it went crazy we see this
emergent<00:01:31.310> gameplay<00:01:31.430> coming<00:01:32.090> about<00:01:32.330> because

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
emergent gameplay coming about because

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.350 
emergent gameplay coming about because
they<00:01:33.290> start<00:01:33.650> figuring<00:01:34.010> out<00:01:34.370> combinations

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
they start figuring out combinations

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.980 
they start figuring out combinations
oh<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.530> toy<00:01:36.800> with<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.730> toy<00:01:38.000> could<00:01:38.600> do<00:01:38.780> this

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
oh that toy with this toy could do this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.290 
oh that toy with this toy could do this
that<00:01:39.920> was<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.280> moment<00:01:40.430> where<00:01:40.730> we<00:01:40.760> really<00:01:41.150> knew

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
that was the moment where we really knew

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.290 
that was the moment where we really knew
hey<00:01:41.570> something<00:01:42.530> special<00:01:42.920> here<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.060> wanted

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
hey something special here but we wanted

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.820 
hey something special here but we wanted
to<00:01:44.360> give<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.540> player<00:01:44.720> even<00:01:44.900> more<00:01:45.140> freedom<00:01:45.500> so

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
to give the player even more freedom so

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.770 
to give the player even more freedom so
we<00:01:46.160> took<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.490> idea<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:47.060> step<00:01:47.090> further<00:01:47.510> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
we took that idea one step further and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.240 
we took that idea one step further and
just<00:01:47.990> said<00:01:48.140> let's<00:01:48.440> go<00:01:48.530> outside<00:01:48.830> toy<00:01:49.070> said

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
just said let's go outside toy said

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.340 
just said let's go outside toy said
let's<00:01:49.460> make<00:01:49.580> toys<00:01:49.880> out<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.210> everything<00:01:50.479> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
let's make toys out of everything and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.170 
let's make toys out of everything and
that<00:01:51.560> project<00:01:51.830> shifted<00:01:52.400> into<00:01:52.550> what<00:01:52.970> we<00:01:53.060> now

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
that project shifted into what we now

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.020 
that project shifted into what we now
know<00:01:53.390> as<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.960> toy<00:01:54.140> box<00:01:54.350> isn't<00:01:54.740> infinity<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
know as the toy box isn't infinity the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.050 
know as the toy box isn't infinity the
name<00:01:56.270> toy<00:01:56.630> box<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:57.170> really<00:01:57.320> apt<00:01:57.619> because<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.759> is

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
name toy box is really apt because it is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.749 
name toy box is really apt because it is
essentially<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.900> modern<00:02:00.470> digital<00:02:00.950> form<00:02:01.550> of

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
essentially a modern digital form of
