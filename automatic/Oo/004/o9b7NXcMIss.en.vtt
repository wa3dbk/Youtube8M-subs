of<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.109> most<00:00:19.289> favorite<00:00:19.470> things<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
of my most favorite things about this

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.509 
of my most favorite things about this
board<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> color<00:00:21.560> changing<00:00:22.560> top<00:00:23.220> sheet

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
board is the color changing top sheet

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
board is the color changing top sheet
that's<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.939> when<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.269> cold<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.840> one

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that's right when it's cold it's one

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.380 
that's right when it's cold it's one
color<00:00:25.320> when<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.800> warm<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.490> another<00:00:27.060> color

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
color when it's warm it's another color

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
color when it's warm it's another color
so<00:00:27.660> right<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.980> could<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.429> way<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
so right now it could be one way and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.160 
so right now it could be one way and
when<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.179> bring<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> outside<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> cold

when I bring it outside in the cold

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830 
when I bring it outside in the cold
weather<00:00:31.850> can<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.880> different<00:00:33.210> color<00:00:33.420> pretty

what<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.360> like<00:02:05.600> most<00:02:05.960> about<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.410> cores<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
what I like most about the cores the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.719 
what I like most about the cores the
thin<00:02:07.280> con<00:02:07.670> construction<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:10.280> wood<00:02:10.459> core<00:02:10.640> is

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
thin con construction the wood core is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.190 
thin con construction the wood core is
actually<00:02:11.030> tapered<00:02:11.450> off<00:02:11.600> towards<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.050> nose

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
and tail Venus boat a little bit more

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.990 
and tail Venus boat a little bit more
maneuverability<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.890> less<00:02:16.370> swing<00:02:16.790> weight

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

as<00:02:17.209> well<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:18.230> know<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.470> don't<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.890> heavy

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
as well you know I don't like heavy

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.310 
as well you know I don't like heavy
boards<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.700> shouldn't<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.660> heavy<00:02:20.900> boards

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
boards you shouldn't like heavy boards

and<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.709> board<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.040> definitely<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and this board is definitely like the
