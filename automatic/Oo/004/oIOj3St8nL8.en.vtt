00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.110
 but tomorrow 's game for 9 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.100
 July is a super important day of the country 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.100
 independence Day 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.499
 my dear ones 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.660
 migueli dollars it is true that you 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.660
 going to dye blonde 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.039
 I think the local corridors 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.430
 they are saying 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.780
 corrected that there are between the corridors there 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.770
 many people who are totally crazy 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.810
 listen to me thin elio the theme of the 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.730
 loteros and every two of the steps like this 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.340
 that we are going to do some is expensive but 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.489
 very easy to do with what 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.379
 type of meat for milanesa that you 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.760
 had the sense my dear to cut it 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.530
 always to Chinese 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
 so that it is not a type escalope type 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.729
 sneakers but small bites like 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.830
 to take about four or five of each 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.470
 one if you allow me what we are going to do 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.810
 it is this meat that is meat for 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.090
 Milanese that can close buttocks can 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.369
 be square the same cut of the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.229
 Milanesa but therefore thus enrome whistle 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.850
 delicate because here also the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.009
 presentation is very important not 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.040
 only in the arms of the lady 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.810
 no one then we do a few pics 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.630
 we chop it a little bit to the meat 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.850
 to cut the nerves especially the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.320
 part of the edges and cough because the idea 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.880
 one step but one cooking 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.420
 absolutely fast 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.009
 the heat that is that piece of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.780
 meat that can be fish that can 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.210
 be chicken that can be meat 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.450
 cow of which you want but cut 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 very thin or a Milanese is a 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.720
 in gallops yes sir the cut to make 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.220
 a escalope milanesa the difference 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.310
 that fire goes through the batter and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.920
 the one turned into Milanese before being 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.009
 milanesa huesca what but in the case 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.569
 of the philosophy of the flesh what 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.759
 we are doing are some courts sites 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.340
 so be very careful not to be in the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.230
 finger to cut the nerves milestone from 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.870
 the edges and that sometimes the meat has 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.870
 there a little white thing 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.080
 and surely yes then the edges 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.750
 and everything nervous is itching 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.190
 fixing there on the table we are going to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.090
 put a little salt 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.680
 more and a soft touch of salt 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.110
 to pass this final of beef 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.290
 side and side for a little flour and 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.060
 shake off the excess as the image of the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.540
 head when the lady gets in the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 movie theater 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.799
 most likely to tell me that fat 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.799
 this cut is painted on the lips 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.640
 let them say what they want 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.340
 then the bits of meat but 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.430
 he puts h the actors takes them out of this 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.410
 done and there is already a warm pan 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.770
 where are we going to put a little bit of oil 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.990
 to brown side and side these piles 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.640
 slices of meat the fact of putting 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.950
 the flour 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.270
 it is so that they brown more quickly and 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.600
 then when they do 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.210
 We made the sauce that liquid that 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.520
 you put him 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.780
 making the broth that the cream makes 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.269
 be like visual 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.000
 that surface flour and that way 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.359
 Give the sauce a little more texture 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.159
 let's go to this they cook fast in the 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.680
 Warm well warm game for 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.650
 a cooking of return and return of 10 15 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.629
 seconds of each unfinished side then you 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.370
 let's make a sauce right there 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.200
 mustard cream 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.480
 a scrambled work Synthesis 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.549
 River Plate cuisine and we will tell you 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.549
 the story but before 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.680
 Bengasi has distributed millions in 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.680
 effectiveness
