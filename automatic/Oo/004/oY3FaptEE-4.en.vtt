paint bolt maybe have some times well
here's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.730> frozen<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.380> get

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
here's a bit more frozen so if I can get

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.570 
here's a bit more frozen so if I can get
this<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.739> time<00:02:26.780> because<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.580> some

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this in time because I have some some

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.650 
this in time because I have some some
not<00:02:30.420> much<00:02:30.600> time<00:02:30.989> left<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.970> if<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> camera<00:02:33.450> runs

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
not much time left so if the camera runs

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.290 
not much time left so if the camera runs
out<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> time<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.209> those

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
out there in that time and one of those

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.590 
out there in that time and one of those
balls<00:02:36.630> were<00:02:36.840> probably<00:02:37.260> broken<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.390> could

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
balls were probably broken so that could

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.069 
balls were probably broken so that could
have<00:02:39.690> been<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.840> reason<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> here<00:02:43.769> we<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:43.860> again
