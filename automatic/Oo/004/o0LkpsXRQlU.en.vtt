alternatives<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.020> mean<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.159> mac<00:01:32.400> one

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
alternatives because I mean the mac one

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.010 
alternatives because I mean the mac one
is<00:01:34.159> like<00:01:35.180> $14<00:01:36.180> fifteen<00:01:36.479> dollars<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:36.960> know

so you save a lot of money that's a big

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
so you save a lot of money that's a big
price<00:01:44.460> difference<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.700> yeah<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> mean<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.479> I

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.340 
Americans do obviously but since these
are<00:04:08.690> new<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.440> mean<00:04:09.920> they

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
are new I mean they

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.980 
are new I mean they
might<00:04:10.470> make<00:04:10.620> more<00:04:10.830> colors<00:04:11.130> later<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.990> the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
might make more colors later and the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.140 
might make more colors later and the
colors<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.320> they<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.590> have<00:04:13.950> are<00:04:14.280> not<00:04:17.150> that

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
colors that they do have are not that

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.830 
colors that they do have are not that
great<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.900> guess<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:20.360> so<00:04:21.360> that's<00:04:21.540> why<00:04:21.630> I'm<00:04:21.750> not

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
great I guess like so that's why I'm not

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.210 
great I guess like so that's why I'm not
even<00:04:22.080> sure<00:04:22.110> if<00:04:22.470> I'm<00:04:22.560> going<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.830> go<00:04:22.980> back<00:04:23.190> and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
even sure if I'm going to go back and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.510 
even sure if I'm going to go back and
get<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.640> rest<00:04:23.670> of<00:04:24.060> them<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.930> because<00:04:25.520> they

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
get the rest of them just because they

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.730 
get the rest of them just because they
have<00:04:26.700> about<00:04:27.000> five<00:04:27.300> or<00:04:27.480> six<00:04:27.630> colors<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.440> like<00:04:28.650> I
