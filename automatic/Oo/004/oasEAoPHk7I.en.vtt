working on with descent 3 basically what
I'm<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.020> show<00:00:07.140> right<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.980> fact

I'm going to show right here is the fact
that<00:00:08.370> I've<00:00:08.490> got<00:00:08.519> multiple<00:00:09.210> platforms<00:00:09.840> all

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
cheat prevention code in there that uses

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.730 
cheat prevention code in there that uses

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
md5 and a much much better checksum

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.370 
md5 and a much much better checksum
system<00:00:20.160> than<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.510> before<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
system than what was in there before the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
system than what was in there before the
old<00:00:22.710> code<00:00:22.949> used<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.369> static<00:00:23.789> hash<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.630> was

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
old code used a static hash that was

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080 
old code used a static hash that was
kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.019> homegrown<00:00:25.230> hash<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.820> using

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
kind of a homegrown hash this is using

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.330 
kind of a homegrown hash this is using
md5<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.019> using<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> salt<00:00:28.590> value<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
md5 and it's using a salt value so that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.290 
md5 and it's using a salt value so that
it's<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.720> very<00:00:31.109> easy<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.679> spoof<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.759> what

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it's not very easy to spoof it so what

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's not very easy to spoof it so what
you're<00:00:33.450> looking<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> Mac<00:00:34.860> OS

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
little easier to debug and as you can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
little easier to debug and as you can
see<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.180> video<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.570> yes<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.769> Linux

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
see in this video but yes it is a Linux

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.289 
see in this video but yes it is a Linux
box<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:07.070> if<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.729> sharp<00:01:09.000> video

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
box and if you have really sharp video

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
box and if you have really sharp video
you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.080> Emacs<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you can see that it's Emacs in the

Mac<00:01:18.000> power<00:01:18.689> book<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> PowerPC

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
Mac power book so this is a PowerPC

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.749

basically<00:02:12.820> it's<00:02:13.820> pretty<00:02:14.030> nice<00:02:14.240> for<00:02:14.540> debugging

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
basically it's pretty nice for debugging

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.120 
basically it's pretty nice for debugging
because<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.230> means<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:15.980> hit<00:02:16.100> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
because it means you can if you hit a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 
because it means you can if you hit a
breakpoint<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.760> don't<00:02:16.910> lose<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.210> mouse<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
breakpoint you don't lose the mouse and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.980 
breakpoint you don't lose the mouse and
everything<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> I'm<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.670> pop<00:02:20.480> into<00:02:20.750> a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
everything so I'm going to pop into a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.270 
everything so I'm going to pop into a
multiplayer<00:02:21.560> game<00:02:22.750> I've<00:02:23.750> got<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.080> search<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
multiplayer game I've got a search for a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.370 
multiplayer game I've got a search for a
specific<00:02:25.490> address<00:02:26.120> because<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.540> got<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> kind<00:02:27.260> of

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
specific address because I got a kind of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.960 
specific address because I got a kind of
a<00:02:27.470> complicated<00:02:27.770> network<00:02:28.370> set<00:02:28.610> up<00:02:28.640> here<00:02:28.880> at

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
a complicated network set up here at

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.990 
a complicated network set up here at
home

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.119 

and<00:02:36.000> now<00:02:36.860> we<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.040> yet<00:02:38.280> another<00:02:38.390> player<00:02:40.129> it's

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
and now we have yet another player it's

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.710 
and now we have yet another player it's
kind<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.340> hard<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.579> navigate<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.599> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
kind of hard to navigate here at the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.179 
kind of hard to navigate here at the
same<00:02:42.930> time<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:45.680> I'm<00:02:46.680> holding<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.040> mouse

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
same time that I'm holding the mouse

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:52.039 
same time that I'm holding the mouse
foot<00:02:48.140> up<00:02:49.140> there<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.829> other<00:02:50.730> friends<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.420> now

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
foot up there are other friends so now

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.110 
foot up there are other friends so now
we've<00:02:52.200> got<00:02:52.379> four<00:02:52.680> different<00:02:53.220> platforms<00:02:56.120> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
we've got four different platforms that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.000 
we've got four different platforms that
are<00:02:57.269> all<00:02:57.450> running<00:03:01.879> in<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.390> same<00:03:03.569> net<00:03:03.750> game<00:03:04.010> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
are all running in the same net game and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.080 
are all running in the same net game and
again<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:05.819> cheat<00:03:06.299> code<00:03:07.010> detection

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
again this is with cheat code detection

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.520 
again this is with cheat code detection
I've<00:03:09.090> tried<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> couple<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.989> different<00:03:10.049> levels

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
I've tried a couple of different levels

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
I've tried a couple of different levels
I'm<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.220> rely<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.150> some<00:03:12.510> other<00:03:12.750> people

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
I'm going to rely on some other people

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.289 
I'm going to rely on some other people
to<00:03:13.139> help<00:03:13.290> me<00:03:13.379> test<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:14.069> as<00:03:14.670> far<00:03:14.909> as<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.120> can

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
to help me test this but as far as I can

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.089 
to help me test this but as far as I can
tell<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.629> is<00:03:15.810> pretty<00:03:16.019> solid<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.530> found<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.920> got

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
tell this is pretty solid I found I got

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.199 
tell this is pretty solid I found I got
to<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> root<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.670> problem<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
to the root of the problem with the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.300 
to the root of the problem with the
checks<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.599> bugs<00:03:18.780> from<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.889> time<00:03:20.129> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
checks and bugs from all this time and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.399 
checks and bugs from all this time and
it<00:03:20.370> really<00:03:20.459> comes<00:03:20.760> down<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:21.150> different

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
it really comes down to different

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.649 
it really comes down to different
internal<00:03:22.409> ways<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.829> processing<00:03:23.659> 32-bit

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
internal ways of processing 32-bit

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.780 
internal ways of processing 32-bit
floating<00:03:24.989> points<00:03:25.409> some<00:03:25.950> architectures<00:03:26.549> want

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
floating points some architectures want

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.670 
floating points some architectures want
to<00:03:26.879> process<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.599> internally<00:03:28.049> as<00:03:28.170> doubles<00:03:28.530> all

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
to process it internally as doubles all

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.210 
to process it internally as doubles all
the<00:03:28.769> time

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
the time

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.539 
the time
others<00:03:30.060> don't<00:03:30.769> because<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.099> lot<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.340> math

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
others don't because the a lot of math

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.280 
others don't because the a lot of math
was<00:03:32.790> being<00:03:32.970> done<00:03:33.180> before<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.690> code<00:03:33.870> before<00:03:34.109> it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
was being done before the code before it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
was being done before the code before it
was<00:03:34.379> checked<00:03:34.590> summed<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:34.980> led<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.819> lot<00:03:35.879> of

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
was checked summed it led to a lot of

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.059 
was checked summed it led to a lot of
inconsistencies<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:37.290> one<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:37.709> two<00:03:37.829> bits

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
inconsistencies of one or two bits

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.890 
inconsistencies of one or two bits
between<00:03:38.310> platforms<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.389> then<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> course

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
between platforms and then of course

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.080 
between platforms and then of course
Jackson<00:03:40.440> didn't<00:03:40.650> match<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.370> new<00:03:41.489> code<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:42.030> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
Jackson didn't match the new code is a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.050 
Jackson didn't match the new code is a
lot<00:03:42.359> more<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.810> binary<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:44.400> doesn't<00:03:44.730> do<00:03:44.849> any

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
lot more of a binary it doesn't do any

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.150 
lot more of a binary it doesn't do any
math<00:03:45.389> before<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.930> does<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.079> checksum<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.859> it's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
math before it does the checksum so it's

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.670 
math before it does the checksum so it's
a<00:03:47.220> lot<00:03:47.310> more<00:03:47.459> reliable<00:03:48.109> anyway<00:03:49.109> there's<00:03:49.440> still

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
a lot more reliable anyway there's still

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.140 
a lot more reliable anyway there's still
a<00:03:49.709> bit<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.129> work<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.519> before<00:03:50.669> we<00:03:50.819> put<00:03:51.060> out

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
a bit of work to do before we put out

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.460 
a bit of work to do before we put out
the<00:03:51.269> patch<00:03:51.449> but<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.750> wanted<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.290> show<00:03:52.440> that

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the patch but I wanted to show that

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.009 
the patch but I wanted to show that
there<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.799> some<00:03:52.949> progress<00:03:53.639> so<00:03:54.150> thanks<00:03:54.900> for

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
there is some progress so thanks for

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.190 
there is some progress so thanks for
your<00:03:55.109> patience<00:03:55.560> talk<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.040> later
