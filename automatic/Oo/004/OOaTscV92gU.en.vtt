00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.600 

boom<00:03:22.420> that's<00:03:22.780> that's<00:03:23.380> basically<00:03:23.770> about<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.310> so

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
boom that's that's basically about it so

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.540

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
right now it's restarting the device as

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.430 
right now it's restarting the device as
you<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:27.850> see<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.210> has<00:03:28.360> been<00:03:28.540> routed<00:03:28.960> with<00:03:28.990> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
you can see it has been routed with the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.780 
you can see it has been routed with the
triangle<00:03:30.100> here<00:03:30.370> which<00:03:30.400> means<00:03:30.760> it's<00:03:31.030> routed

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
triangle here which means it's routed

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:47.130 
triangle here which means it's routed
and<00:03:33.790> there<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> see<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.420> boot<00:03:34.780> animation

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.400 

it<00:03:47.860> might<00:03:48.040> take<00:03:48.250> some<00:03:48.430> time<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.880> boot<00:03:49.060> up<00:03:49.410> so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
it might take some time to boot up so

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.390 
it might take some time to boot up so
right<00:03:50.560> now<00:03:50.710> it's<00:03:50.860> upgrading<00:03:51.310> the
