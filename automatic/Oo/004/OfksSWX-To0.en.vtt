00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.070
 everybody went 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.450
 dim nice 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.000
 listening for a percentage 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.930
 we just did not communicate long enough 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.910
 12 I also did not get all the results 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.040
 did not want a former head 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.979
 comments with 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.189
 square really 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.230
 like a story about 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 in all of these conversions 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.080
 compositions as was the case of their country 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.599
 own version 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.919
 but because there are so many very many 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.949
 let's say so on the internet all three 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.669
 kilometer think 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.149
 I would like to draw some conclusions 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.790
 learn consists of first hand 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.790
 in order of Vladivostok 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190
 still eyewitness 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.040
 drove around reaching 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.640
 this is what he 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.130
 why would grow a team I would know that 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.300
 I was no longer on the team 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.520
 current chairman of two 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.990
 blames at home 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.830
 and who made this decision 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.000
 in this situation 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.580
 senior officer 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.290
 My personal 4 6 and in the form of society said that 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.740
 she took a little bunch today 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.450
 different reasons in principle 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.600
 prime minister not known 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620
 so I found out about it 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.490
 then not afraid in the code will 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 consider the teams to be 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.070
 decide today to think what is already 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 there is such a situation that made sense 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 no i don't have a team 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 that is, you hit the force 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.460
 in many ways a little bit of them that composition 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.870
 which the 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.910
 in which and the east understands earlier 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 i would like to play brazil 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.750
 I understand that a great experience but self-defense 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.230
 four hours later with Putin like 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.620
 noted that this blow is well, that is, time 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.880
 showed that as bryusova became themselves 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.970
 better media support costs 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 Wednesday at the meeting with the delegation 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 so easy friday the game process 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.560
 symbolism 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.430
 well what are your guys hiding moments 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.479
 who lost this whole car but 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.940
 ministries 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.060
 let her stay on conscience 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.560
 prevent roll 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.970
 but it's good, but what are you in now? 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.129
 played face taken 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.120
 let's say a place in the playoffs then well 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.749
 played swam confidently enough 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.349
 what was he like now 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.999
 fronting this team 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.099
 your opinion of objects before this command 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.699
 seeking to fit 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.769
 heineken shares collected by Moscow time uneasy difference 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.819
 left everything seriously 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.649
 at the back of benefits because he 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.929
 here is the backbone of the team days we give them Baikal 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.139
 composition means dollars so we aim 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.209
 if I don't know 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.859
 except what he asks to win the championship 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.579
 listen dim and such a question 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.579
 a year Russian trouble 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.370
 percentage when we start to appear 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.389
 exactly the teams that will be 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.219
 prop 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.509
 let's say so Russian according to the data now as 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.199
 since there was a lot of talk about it 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.739
 it seems that the new ambassador 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.569
 there is no team when Kirovsk appears 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.189
 teams and year 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.919
 that moment came 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.869
 what we gave to the field four teams 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.299
 Associated with Russian teams but the image of growth 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.859
 organization entering new 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.459
 teams of russian new mentor and 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.589
 cling vodka and the EU very much 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.469
 interesting teams discount 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.849
 Karen villas on the lips of the mines and here are the young 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.209
 guys promising places dancers 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.069
 I think that the amendment is happy and 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.029
 soon mun thanks to good competition 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.649
 country 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.629
 people will even be up to level 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.939
 render piracy better results on 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.819
 European Championships listening 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.209
 an attacking question about 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.149
 next year I understand that the issue 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.489
 first enchantment 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.799
 you are going there 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.299
 even going to finance while 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.120
 the only one in which authenticity 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.809
 because you see confidential naked 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.149
 I try not to miss any 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.069
 the end of the sphere of as services so with all this I 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.829
 I think now we will try it 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.949
 do our best to win 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.709
 remaining games in the group 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.349
 the cost is that 2 0 there is a chance to get there 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.509
 genders and association this is a new system this 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.029
 plan for the new year there will be seen further 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.799
 How far is understood not looking 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.030
 there is not yet his post until he 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.639
 but nothing to gain momentum 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.759
 work out 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.869
 went to the cinema wish good luck older 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:11.979
