diva<00:02:52.890> Deanna's<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> video<00:02:54.760> when<00:02:55.270> she<00:02:55.420> had<00:02:55.600> her

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
diva Deanna's a video when she had her

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.270 
diva Deanna's a video when she had her
18<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.380> seemed<00:02:56.620> pretty<00:02:56.770> long<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.220> I

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
18 and that seemed pretty long so I

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.160 
18 and that seemed pretty long so I
figured<00:02:57.550> I'd<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.790> go<00:02:57.970> 24<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.750> long<00:02:58.900> there's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
figured I'd just go 24 the long there's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.060 
figured I'd just go 24 the long there's
