00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.420
 great fighters my name is mihail i'm glad 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.260
 present to your attention a new 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.279
 heading 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.869
 game devices that I hope will be 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 constant on my channel not i will 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.640
 talk about the things that he himself 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.640
 I use it myself I will tell 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.059
 why I chose them at what price 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.460
 what are they in operation and so on 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.770
 I think this rubric will help a lot 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.920
 you with the choice of a mouse 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.469
 for example, monitor keyboards and more 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 something and the first will be a story about 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.520
 my new mouse that I purchased 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.149
 about a month ago 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.610
 This is a photo bloody v8 and so why 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 just a photo and not any there 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.969
 steelseries sensei or Odessa raiser gift 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.059
 I'll tell you now, but first I will tell you about 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.549
 price characteristics of the place of purchase and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.860
 other such useful things 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.119
 I purchased this mouse on the Internet 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 store Eldorado priced at 599 rubles yes 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.570
 Yes, you heard right only 600 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.180
 rubles rubles is an extremely low price for 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.460
 so many cool gaming mice I bought 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.250
 its in the version with not activated 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.920
 gaming software why 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.229
 you for one simple reason I never 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.390
 life did not use any macros 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.180
 not going to use them though 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.790
 By the way, for the bloody series 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.460
 a special St. Petersburg was developed 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.619
 software where already laid 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 specially created macros which 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.780
 will let you even bursts shoot at 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 one point that is quench very much 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.610
 efficiently but as you understand any 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 macro for example in battles fanbases 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.590
 it will be banned that is to buy such 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.930
 mouse and activate on extremely dangerous 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
 so be careful about 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.700
 picking then it is pretty meager that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 In principle, it is clear considering the cost 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.679
 these mice only include steam 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.590
 stickers and cloth to wipe 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.810
 sensor 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.269
 the sensor is very unusual by the way it is closed 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.060
 glass partition so there 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.190
 now no dust falls and so 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.230
 further that happens quite often in 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.180
 laser or optical mice 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.330
 another feature of this mouse 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.459
 are metal legs that are not 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.980
 require replacement is very 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.030
 durable sensor has a standard 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.610
 resolution up to 3200 dipia more you 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 principle does not need well now 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.010
 I’ll tell you why I am the one 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 I decided to buy because it was originally mine 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.060
 the choice for buying a new mouse was 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.130
 steelgories raigo 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.280
 still pretty well-known firms 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.920
 Among gamers, a new mouse wanted 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.829
 buy it but then I decided to give it a go 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.660
 brains let's say and still came to 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.360
 I conclude that it is better to buy 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.780
 of attack the fact is that prices 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.480
 most of the modern gaming mice 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.959
 extremely overestimated and overestimated not 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.600
 justified that is, we are being pushed for more 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.139
 the high price is something that we basically do not 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.780
 need for example the sensor divides up to 8 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.730
 thousand and four hundred never 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.540
 won't benefit most 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.480
 players playing you and 800 or 1600 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.180
 i.e. this is ordinary marketing soar 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.220
 what the buyer doesn’t need 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.470
 highest possible price 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.290
 what else at first glance usual 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.630
 player expensive gaming mice are superior 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.970
 cheaper naturally choosing 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.849
 finishing materials ie plastic 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.940
 trust me of a tech bloody v8 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.069
 no worse than steelseries my sensei 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.790
 comrade have son sir 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.410
 that is, I often used 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.880
 accordingly I have something to compare and 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.190
 believe me, the attacks are as good 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.380
 soft-touch plastic is just as comfortable 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.620
 same pleasant to the touch while 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.830
 steelseries ral costs 2000 rubles 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.250
 and of attacks bloody v8 only 600 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.340
 rubles 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.430
 feel the difference well and the most important 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.610
 the factor of choice was reliability that is 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.440
 before this mouse i mean bloody v8 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.020
 I had two years and a photo x7 f4 it 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.210
 just not kill the mouse with it you can 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.240
 do anything and she doesn't even 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.610
 scratched did not even peel paint she 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.340
 still works fine i decided 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.490
 buy a new one just say so for the sake of 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.250
 to update the feel of the game that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.620
 so I am absolutely sure that the new 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.090
 The generation of mice from this company will be 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.070
 as reliable 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.169
 unlike more specialized 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.410
 companies whose products are often 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.850
 suffers from marriage and other damage well 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.430
 Well, now tell you about my 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.340
 impressions first ergonomics 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.010
 sizes they are gorgeous i mean young 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.560
 quite big wide me personally 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.130
 It does not fit the little mouse and here 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.190
 we will be 8 and perfectly fit my hand so 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.800
 what if your hand is big or medium 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.570
 then it is your choice but naturally 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.090
 it is advisable to go to the store before 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.760
 buying and feeling and yourself 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.340
 try how it sits your hand and 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.310
 so depending on this to buy 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.650
 usability is the main 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.560
 characteristic for the mouse as for 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.710
 accuracy of movement and speed of response all 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.620
 well I tested this mouse on the site 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.680
 400 g which was created specifically for 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.490
 gamers and showed pretty good 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.800
 results 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.169
 well, the most important impression of the mouse 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.050
 it became what I began to grow cd 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.599
 in battle I am not joking this is true 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.840
 perhaps it’s worth noting 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:03.539
 constantly flashing red light 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.759
 I personally do not interfere, but I think someone 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.400
 it seems annoying 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.990
 it can not be turned off here are such pies 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.240
 so my friends if you are not a major and and 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.240
 accustomed to spending money wisely then 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.610
 so bloody v8 or what's the version of them 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.490
 pretty much choose for yourself 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.610
 the most suitable design for convenience 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.680
 it is a good choice even an excellent choice in 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.199
 as a gaming mouse and do not try 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.809
 buy these stupid macros play 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.669
 honestly so what 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:38.189

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.800
