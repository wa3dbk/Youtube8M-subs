00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 have so 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.299
 Welcome to Alpha Centauri 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.460
 Do you know how old the earth is? 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.659
 many people know that me and stupid 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.249
 it is a question that 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.529
 For 500 years 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.570
 left unanswered, she has all sorts of thoughts made many people 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.019
 in itself thoughts makes it 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.649
 in fact 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.309
 in a way that for an incredibly long centuries 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.590
 Has quarreled 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.380
 a dispute between theologians and scientists 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.810
 where nature had succeeded Interplay Manfort 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.830
 and which one could perhaps be hers with full commitment of Carter 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.610
 Scholars are people who move on from normal mortals 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.519
 distinguish murdered ability 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.180
 otherwise two British uncomplicated errors 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.280
 to delight 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.459
 So SUI are today in the mission with dogmatism 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.039
 He would be confronted with the notion that general ones are like 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.040
 you are 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.730
 the idea 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.470
 how old is the earth is the topic today 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.300
 and of course it is a very important topic 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.080
 because of course it will tell something 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 about it like the earth 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 Final score 1 or also 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.090
 how old at least the sun must be 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.270
 because the age of the earth 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.660
 is necessarily coupled with the fact that the sun is at least the same 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.859
 long seemed to have because 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.859
 On Earth, the life processes have been going on for quite some time 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.940
 but you did not have to do that yet 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.240
 In the Middle Ages, for example, you have to give mankind to the Middle Ages 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480
 People at the same gate slammed Dom from watching 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.120
 the earth is changing 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.040
 Wind water and year was the people what he pregnant landscapes 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.520
 change and so on 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.909
 so there are 4 if there are processes there is the surface of the Earth 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.710
 the location 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.299
 constantly changing and still 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.259
 you could not imagine that these natural processes 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.650
 could tell something about it 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.150
 how the earth was created that's why you got that exactly what you had 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.039
 what did you have you had the Bible 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.509
 I have to go back to my candlestick and I have to tell them exactly 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:15.599
 what happened there 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.369
 1600 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.679
 50 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.129
 has a heart of the Archbishop there Ems look 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.260
 Episode that just when the Genesis has made 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.760
 and has exactly the generation sequence Bible balance, he noted 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.719
 I quote m 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.159
 the earth is on October 23 of the year 4004 BC 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.159
 originated at nine o'clock in the morning in Mesopotamia 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.359
 So got fair now he got from the day before 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.829
 1655 years later there was the flood 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.389
 So far everything was clear for theology 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.449
 because in the bible, that was what was in it so if I'm the truth 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.579
 and that immediately around the absolute and the only true 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.060
 and yet the Bible is literally taken literally then it was just that 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.999
 Earth only so old 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.169
 the problem 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.579
 was like so often 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.519
 Common sense 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.079
 the common sense of the construction or that nature is observing 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.309
 he said 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.589
 Sammer that can not be true 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.210
 4000 years as good as nothing more 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.690
 For example, how long did influence need to dig out 1 cm of a valley 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.319
 and see it in the deep canyon 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.219
 had taken that 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.870
 That took longer than 4000 years 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.870
 There were already voices telling about it 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.959
 it can not be true 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.219
 there was something much worse the humans started 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.129
 and operated mining 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.229
 and increasingly stronger 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.529
 and noticed some very strange things, for example 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.409
 the deeper I drill into the earth the warmer all the warmer 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.289
 every hundred meters so degrees Celsius 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.089
 that was not even Merkel that all the strangest was 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.089
 the discovery 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:58.149
 from very strange 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.199
 fossils 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.939
 Fossils 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.979
 now clicked in that you do not seem so strange 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.879
 but if they are fossilized fish 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.689
 to find in the mountainous 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.739
 So far away from the coastline, then it is clear 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.669
 That's what processes have to give 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.060
 around which the mountains have been raised or the works used to be 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.449
 is the authority to come in and was there what the announced 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.120
 God love you 4 will deny even those on foot just as extinct 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.439
 but we should continue the Roscher has calculated exactly 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.740
 is clear the earth annoying says hans-heinz october and likes 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.659
 but of course there was also nature understand says nee nee nee nee no nee 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.090
 It could not have been that way, but it could not have been the case with the theological picture 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:46.490
 Bringing one together can lead to catastrophes 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.220
 but even though these cycles make one of every few thousand years one 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.090
 giant 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.530
 Percent violent natural disaster can therefore earthquake from the cup 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.750
 Brussels floods so heavily its keyword flood 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.150
 and only 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.830
 At that time he would only have taken the animals with him to his ark which we have today 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.590
 know that way 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.840
 and all the other fossilized fossils would be the ones that are practically at 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.080
 Deluge lost its life 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.069
 Meier, then 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.939
 come and try it 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.749
 the so far actually quite consistent, one would say 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.039
 But what is really going on over the centuries? 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.039
 come that we know today exactly what happens 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.909
 where do I start the best 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.870
 Science of geology 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.870
 So the Earth sciences 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.320
 which arose in 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.400
 17 and 18 Century and therefore all of us quite commercial Konan because 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.069
 you wanted to know 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.240
 how do I find raw materials 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.330
 in the belly of the earth 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.160
 coal 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.210
 Food Copper Zinc and so on can be said to be good with mining percent 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.040
 and the US has has and quite commercial not to say 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.770
 Dumps character 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770
 and it was found during this excavation 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.729
 Dispute in the earth 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.620
 beautiful layers of limestone and sandstone on top of each other 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.400
 they have to be against how I came to him 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.880
 and one also noticed by long observation how such things could arise 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.880
 namely slow processes 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.270
 which systematically change after you on earth 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.880
 For example, if a sea of ​​sand deposited and then if there's something on it 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.580
 Forests produce sandblasting or if the shells 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.200
 their caves alarmed at the seabed after their life, so to speak 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.069
 and it is pressed together you can create limestone 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.240
 and that's how it was 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.490
 on the side of 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.930
 at that time not yet so-called geologists of the naturalists a picture 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.600
 that he changes very slowly that the surface features like 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.939
 Charges reason seas 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.509
 to change very slowly 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.590
 Of course, all of this slow change clearly had the problem 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:02.889
 slowly it is said 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.509
 it takes a long time
