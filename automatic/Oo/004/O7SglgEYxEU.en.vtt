00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
 hello everyone with you andrey andreevich my 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.280
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:12.450
 1200 tenth problem solve equation 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 so what we have is written under the letter a 14 x 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:26.269
 minus 8 x + 3 x in brackets is equal to 1512 we 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.720
 starting with brackets count 8 x + 3 x 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 will be 11x 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.680
 rewrite our equation 14 x minus a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.040
 stood in front of the bracket and in brackets 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.289
 it turned out 11 x minus stood before 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.640
 in front of the whole bracket in brackets 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:56.760
 it turned out 11 x it turns out minus 11 x 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:03.860
 tank and subtract from 14 x subtract 11 x 14 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 x minus 1 x it turns out 3x is equal to 1512 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.170
 what if you have a number then a letter 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.390
 there is or what is familiar but to live therefore 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 multipliers the multiplier works to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.330
 one of the multipliers you need to find 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.009
 the work I want to write immediately say in 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.470
 a heart 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:28.380
 product aria need product 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.100
 divide by another factor not that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.590
 Immediately began to draw in a column 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.829
 hurried divide produced by another 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:45.119
 multiplier for x to find so extend 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:48.770
 We will of course in column 1512 deal inside 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.630
 we take 55 to 315 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 read from 15 subtract 15 is zero 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.950
 we demolish one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.469
 This one was demolished but it turned out 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.049
 number which is less than three, therefore 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:07.909
 we write 0 and we demolish one more digit 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.909
 already 12 now we take 4 4 ​​by 3 12 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.450
 it turns out 504 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:21.150
 then x is 504 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.300
 Here is the answer and we have 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.600
 one more letter b by the way 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.970
 the letter would be solved exactly the same way so i 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
 I recommend everyone to pause and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.020
 try to solve the letter b 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.680
 yourself and then see mine 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.620
 the decision of the letter b the letter b is the same therefore 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 try i'm sure every one of you 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.570
 It should turn out to check that you have 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:54.210
 it turned out 5 y minus 3y turns 2y 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.210
 5 minus 32 get 2 games 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:03.700
 rewrite the minus standing in front of the bracket in 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:09.610
 brackets it turned out 2 toys now 11 y 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.970
 minus 2y this 9 y equals 8136 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.900
 this reproduction to find one of 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.050
 multipliers need the product 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:26.050
 divide by another factor 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.910
 well and a divider that at a column 8136 we divide 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.400
 on 9 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.580
 first we take 99 by 981 it turns out 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.840
 when subtracting zero we take down the top three 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.000
 the resulting number is less than nine 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.430
 therefore we write 0 and we demolish one more digit 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:54.430
 and now we take 4 4 ​​by 936 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:56.740
 94 y is equal and i became 94 904 904 i 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.540
 I think made a reservation in my say 94 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.030
 wrong 904 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.520
 y is equal to 904 on this all write to 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.290
 comments it is clear whether or not the decision 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.630
 if you like my videos 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.910

 bye everyone
