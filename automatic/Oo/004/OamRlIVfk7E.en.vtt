00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.720 
think he's like top 10 top 5 or is he
later<00:02:22.630> he's<00:02:23.630> not<00:02:23.930> he's<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.530> top<00:02:25.070> ten<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.580> he

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
later he's not he's not top ten but he

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.570 
later he's not he's not top ten but he
belongs<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> upper<00:02:26.840> me<00:02:27.190> he<00:02:28.190> belongs<00:02:28.430> to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
belongs to the upper me he belongs to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
belongs to the upper me he belongs to
upper<00:02:28.820> meet<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.150> yeah<00:02:29.780> he<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.170> loses<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
upper meet you yeah he just loses to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.810

vortex<00:02:31.430> pract<00:02:31.790> ID<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.390> Gao<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:34.610> he<00:02:34.730> has

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
vortex pract ID and Gao so but he has

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.370 
vortex pract ID and Gao so but he has
good<00:02:35.120> matchup<00:02:35.480> against<00:02:35.750> southern<00:02:35.989> practice

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
good matchup against southern practice

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.949 
good matchup against southern practice
as<00:02:36.530> well<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.910> maybe<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.510> would<00:02:38.630> get<00:02:38.750> better

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
as well so maybe you would get better

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.020 
as well so maybe you would get better
but<00:02:39.110> he's<00:02:39.620> still<00:02:40.070> not<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.520> top<00:02:40.670> because<00:02:40.850> of

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
but he's still not in the top because of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.270 
but he's still not in the top because of
the<00:02:41.090> bad<00:02:41.239> matchups<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.530> what<00:02:42.800> do<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.010> think

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the bad matchups so what do you think

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.070 
the bad matchups so what do you think
are<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.970> bad<00:02:44.570> matchups<00:02:45.050> for<00:02:45.680> four<00:02:46.010> again<00:02:46.640> I

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
are the bad matchups for four again I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.750 
are the bad matchups for four again I
think<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.410> hardest<00:02:48.920> one<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:50.350> Akuma<00:02:51.350> Cao<00:02:51.800> Fei

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
think the hardest one is Akuma Cao Fei

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.670 
think the hardest one is Akuma Cao Fei
Long<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.239> union<00:02:53.630> these<00:02:54.320> are<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> formations

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
Long and union these are the formations

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.250 
Long and union these are the formations
that<00:02:55.040> thing<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.700> most<00:02:55.940> difficult<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.989> I

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
that thing is the most difficult but I

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.190 
that thing is the most difficult but I
personally<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.220> hate<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.239> most<00:02:59.420> yeah

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
personally I hate you in the most yeah

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.780 
personally I hate you in the most yeah
so<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> practice<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:00.950> most<00:03:01.220> part<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.459> matchup

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
so I practice the most part I matchup

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.030 
so I practice the most part I matchup
because<00:03:01.970> i<00:03:02.060> think<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.080> worst<00:03:03.739> match-up

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
because i think is the worst match-up

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.650 
because i think is the worst match-up
email<00:03:04.550> opinion<00:03:04.880> again<00:03:06.130> why<00:03:07.130> do<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.370> think

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
because you do so well again why do you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.890 
because you do so well again why do you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
think ken is so under played as a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.620 
think ken is so under played as a
character<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.769> there's<00:03:13.730> i<00:03:14.000> only<00:03:14.480> long

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
character because there's i only long

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.229 
character because there's i only long
like<00:03:14.840> three<00:03:15.290> game<00:03:15.590> players<00:03:15.890> their<00:03:16.880> student

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
like three game players their student

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.890 
like three game players their student
American<00:03:17.570> was<00:03:17.739> Gib<00:03:18.739> oh<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.160> think<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
American was Gib oh I think it in the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.780 
American was Gib oh I think it in the
early<00:03:21.200> days<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.680> there's<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.130> few<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.430> Japan

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
early days and there's a few in Japan

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.740 
early days and there's a few in Japan
but<00:03:23.570> why<00:03:23.989> do<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:24.290> few<00:03:24.500> people<00:03:24.709> play<00:03:25.160> him

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
but why do so few people play him

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.150 
but why do so few people play him
because<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.780> think<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.140> execution<00:03:27.410> for<00:03:27.950> gain

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
because I think the execution for gain

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.250 
because I think the execution for gain
is<00:03:28.340> pretty<00:03:28.610> tight<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.239> if<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.780> want<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.019> play

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
is pretty tight but if you want to play

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.500 
is pretty tight but if you want to play
the<00:03:30.470> setups<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.400> set<00:03:31.579> us<00:03:31.700> pretty<00:03:32.030> hard<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.360> do

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
the setups the set us pretty hard to do

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.460 
the setups the set us pretty hard to do
like<00:03:32.930> it's<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.680> lot<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.040> one<00:03:34.519> frame<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:35.420> can

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
like it's a lot of one frame you can

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.400 
like it's a lot of one frame you can
best<00:03:36.470> cushion<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:36.980> not<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.489> easy<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.410> you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
best cushion is not that easy and you

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.890 
best cushion is not that easy and you
need<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.860> piano<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:40.579> well<00:03:40.820> with<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.420> hands

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
need to piano really well with the hands

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.440 
need to piano really well with the hands
so<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.470> lot<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:42.980> people<00:03:43.100> doesn't<00:03:43.700> want<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:43.910> it's

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
so a lot of people doesn't want to it's

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.600 
so a lot of people doesn't want to it's
quite<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.750> long<00:03:44.930> path<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.320> go<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.769> set<00:03:46.310> us<00:03:46.430> for

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
quite a long path to go and set us for

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.640 
quite a long path to go and set us for
different<00:03:46.910> practice<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.600> once<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.079> master<00:03:48.500> it

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.350 
different practice I once you master it
i<00:03:48.769> think<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:49.370> big<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.790> will<00:03:50.000> be<00:03:50.120> really

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.910 
i think is big it will be really
irritating<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.140> opponent<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.680> must

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920

you can hold out kami and fail on too

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.860 
you can hold out kami and fail on too
much<00:04:29.240> because<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:31.699> new<00:04:31.850> version<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.449> expect

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
much because the new version I expect

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.990 
much because the new version I expect
