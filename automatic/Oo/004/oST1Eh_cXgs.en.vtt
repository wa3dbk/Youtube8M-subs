00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.850
 Hello, today we will do here 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 such a ribbon flower for us 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.290
 need a multi-layered petal 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.060
 I recently showed you two ways 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.369
 do it and who will be interested 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.530
 I will leave a link to this video 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 in the description and now let's see 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.850
 one of these ways 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.669
 you need to take 2 squares two by 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.410
 two centimeters two squares in size 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.140
 three and a half for three and a half 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.790
 centimeters and two squares in size 5 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 by 5 centimeters now from these 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.559
 do double sharp squares 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 petals square fold in half 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.830
 fix in half again for convenience 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.269
 corner lighter 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.900
 different color ribbons in the same way 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.900
 we fold a square in half a triangle 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:03.030
 again dad and fasten the lighter 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.330
 impose one triangle on another 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.460
 we leave about 12 millimeters to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.720
 the bottom triangle peeking from us and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.720
 make a sharp petal 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:33.289
 cut the corners we fix and also 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.289
 back side 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.600
 align the petal like us 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.990
 like and hook also lower 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 side we get three two-color 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.789
 petals of different sizes and now for us 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.030
 need to glue and less petals in more 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.659
 I start with the smallest petal 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.579
 I put on the back of the petal and 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.500
 put now 1 petal 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:11.370
 and insert it first insert it down then 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.379
 so here up and stick and for sure 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.620
 I also pasted and now these petals 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.940
 In the largest I put glue on the back 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.790
 the side. 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.109
 and you can apply now 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.120
 neatly insert immediately start 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.880
 petal so as not to touch 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.519
 petal by petal te glue applied 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.470
 and only after that I press already 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.120
 so that it stuck like this and such 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.519
 petals for one flower to us this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:52.910
 make 6 pieces now glue 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.910
 petals between each other information 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.870
 glue the last petal than one 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.870
 the side 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.120
 I made two tapes to make the base 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.570
 among themselves universal transparent 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:48.920
 glue and cut out a circle of 3 and 4 centimeters 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:48.920
 diameter around the edge I swim gru a lighter 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.330
 I got it two- way what 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.150
 I hid two different tapes put 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.150
 thermal glue on the base 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.360
 This is what a multilayer flower looks like. 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.420
 petals but i want to add here yet 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.070
 one kind of petal 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.620
 take a tape the size of 3 and a half 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.880
 a centimeter and a half 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.160
 fold along in half purl 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.310
 side inward further apply 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.830
 pintsetik here is such a top corner 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.830
 at the bend diagonally 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:03.340
 we trim and fix with a lighter so 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:07.840
 Next, we turn one edge of the tape to 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:16.050
 the middle as well as the other 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:21.520
 side down you can trim a little and 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:24.700
 fasten with a lighter and we get 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.280
 Here is a petal of such petals to us 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.860
 need to make 6 pieces now glue 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.860
 these petals between petals on a flower 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.430
 put a drop of hot melt 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.320
 for the middle I'll use here 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:33.850
 such a strazik we fill the glue empty 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:38.800
 the place that we will have now we put 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:42.190
 time we have traffic and fast plates left 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:47.260
 hand hot glue must be well 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:49.360
 fasten the middle of the flower that's all 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.400
 so we have a flower 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.410
 if you like it put a class and 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.180
