00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:09.050
 Today I want the nico my power 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:16.230
 That should be called that 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:18.210
 nico power tube 4000 and 2600 introduce 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.390
 I have these two at ours now 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.070
 shop recorded the difference he made that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.189
 here is the 4000 with four 1000 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 milliampere and this is the 2600 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.930
 which I liked so much that I did 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.809
 no cable has to grind again 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.329
 but I put this in directly 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.500
 the usb from my computer or one 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.989
 other usb supply to the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.420
 I would have to reload after loading 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 but if I load a device now 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 in the case is that here with lightning 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:06.479
 connection is that of the 4000 m 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.909
 power tube 4011 for lightning by the way 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 once presses and the color the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.549
 then lights up says how strong the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.189
 loaded blue example so at 100 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.390
 or 80 to 100 green and blue red and so on 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.990
 continue and here I have one 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.299
 is now first another question clear 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.299
 but that is for micro usb connection there 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:39.750
 can i load my gadgets the micro 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:44.369
 usb have my headset here now 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.180
 or my android cellphone or or or 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:54.240
 What is there for everyone? 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.759
 the 2600 or the four-thousand comes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.710
 such a by the way of my mission 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.649
 I need a white just on vacation 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.870
 the already firmly had the use not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.740
 combines the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:11.920
 I do not trust myself with this xl1 usb 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.700
 that plugged in 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.970
 this bag or internal this one 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.210
 small bags and had at any time 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.110
 principle an excellent flashlight 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:33.440
 It really really bad 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.860
 then do with left and sos and 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.990
 what that all that makes everything 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.570
 So really a high quality lamps 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:46.010
 at any time with pretty strong 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.410
 or long endurance with such 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 four thousand rechargeable battery or fits here 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.760
 It's not wonderful either 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.570
 Central but it has good benefits 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.890
 mutual also rubbish because the thing 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.530
 I have to be that things already 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.780
 wake-up call protection 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.360
 but that too is wonderful 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.980
 flashlight suitable why pz 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.980
 The battery is probably more possible 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.330
 in that case, he is talking about here 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.040
 the lights as much tension still in there 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.040
 However, it is already not much in it 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.610
 the beepston has that synonymous with the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.840
 Charge state of the battery to do the beeping 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:48.650
 but you really have one again 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:52.790
