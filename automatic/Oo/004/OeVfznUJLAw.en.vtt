00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
so here it is Keith I got my flashlight

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
so here it is Keith I got my flashlight
right<00:00:02.879> here<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:04.009> I<00:00:05.009> wired<00:00:05.790> them<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.270> front

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
right here and I wired them to the front

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.890 
right here and I wired them to the front
and<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> back<00:00:06.960> leads<00:00:07.849> goes<00:00:08.849> down<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and the back leads goes down I have a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.950 
and the back leads goes down I have a
quick<00:00:10.260> weatherproof<00:00:10.860> disconnect<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.490> here

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:25.640 

and<00:00:17.840> right<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.699> this<00:00:22.519> cable<00:00:24.019> it<00:00:25.019> comes<00:00:25.439> up

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and right here this cable it comes up

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
and right here this cable it comes up
from<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.250> gear<00:00:26.580> mechanism<00:00:27.180> that's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
from this little gear mechanism that's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
from this little gear mechanism that's
attached<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> spokes<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.949> goes

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
attached to the spokes it just goes

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.290 
attached to the spokes it just goes
right<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.289> screw<00:00:31.289> down<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:32.120> comes<00:00:33.120> up

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
right on the screw down here comes up

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.889 
right on the screw down here comes up
it's<00:00:33.600> spinning<00:00:34.110> inside<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.450> I'll<00:00:39.690> take

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it's spinning inside here and I'll take

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.190 
it's spinning inside here and I'll take
this<00:00:40.020> off<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200 

well<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.530> square<00:00:46.950> anyways<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> square

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
well it's square anyways it's a square

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.319 
well it's square anyways it's a square
fitting<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.700> DC<00:00:51.090> motor

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
fitting and this is a little DC motor

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
fitting and this is a little DC motor
from<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.690> printer<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
from a printer I it just had like a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
from a printer I it just had like a
little<00:00:55.620> gear<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> front<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.879> put<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
little gear on the front of it I put a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.689 
little gear on the front of it I put a
pen<00:00:57.480> cap<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> pushed<00:00:58.500> jb<00:00:58.890> weld<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
pen cap over it pushed jb weld into it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.270 
pen cap over it pushed jb weld into it
and<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> inserted<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> square<00:01:01.649> tip<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then I inserted the square tip and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
and then I inserted the square tip and
pulled<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> straight<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.719> put<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> little

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
pulled it straight out I put a little

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.289 
pulled it straight out I put a little
bit<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> oil<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:04.979> first<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:06.119> made<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
bit of oil on there first and it made a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
bit of oil on there first and it made a
perfect<00:01:06.780> impression<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.770> once

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
perfect impression and just it at once

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880 
perfect impression and just it at once
of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.720> fitting<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> has

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of the of this fitting so then it has

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.840 
of the of this fitting so then it has
somewhere<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:14.220> normally<00:01:14.640> goes<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
somewhere to go this normally goes to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.149 
somewhere to go this normally goes to
the<00:01:15.060> speedometer<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.650> quickly

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the speedometer right here which quickly

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
the speedometer right here which quickly
just<00:01:17.520> jumps<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.060> over<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.259> kind

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just jumps right over here it was kind

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
just jumps right over here it was kind
of<00:01:19.530> hard<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> find<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> threading<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.790> this

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of hard to find the threading on this

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
of hard to find the threading on this
old<00:01:21.090> bike

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
old bike

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.760 
old bike
it's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.680> 3/8<00:01:23.070> compression<00:01:23.790> fitting<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's a 3/8 compression fitting so to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.600 
it's a 3/8 compression fitting so to
actually<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.090> same<00:01:27.420> fitting<00:01:27.840> over<00:01:28.200> here

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
actually get that same fitting over here

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
actually get that same fitting over here
over<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.090> piece<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> jg<00:01:30.869> weld<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.350> in

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
I just pulled it out of the printer and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.640 
I just pulled it out of the printer and
now<00:02:23.090> when<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.300> spin<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.110> don't<00:02:24.470> provide

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
now when you spin it and don't provide

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.890 
now when you spin it and don't provide
electricity<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.640> spin<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> output<00:02:26.420> shaft<00:02:26.630> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
electricity to spin the output shaft it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.530 
electricity to spin the output shaft it
creates<00:02:27.200> electricity<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.610> DC<00:02:28.970> electricity

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
creates electricity so DC electricity

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.180 
creates electricity so DC electricity
works<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.050> don't<00:02:33.380> really<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.740> why<00:02:33.920> but

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
works so I don't really know why but

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.010 
works so I don't really know why but
when<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.340> spin<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> flashlight<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.780> when<00:02:35.930> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
when I spin the flashlight so when I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.530 
when I spin the flashlight so when I
spin<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> wheel<00:02:36.760> or<00:02:37.760> ride<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> bike<00:02:38.330> at

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
spin the wheel or ride the bike at

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.390 
spin the wheel or ride the bike at
pretty<00:02:38.780> low<00:02:38.840> speeds<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:39.500> terms<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.890> sine<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
pretty low speeds in terms of sine so it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400 
pretty low speeds in terms of sine so it
creates<00:02:40.670> some<00:02:40.820> decent<00:02:41.150> voltage<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:42.200> going<00:02:42.350> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
creates some decent voltage I'm going to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.150 
creates some decent voltage I'm going to
test<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.800> tomorrow<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.810> light<00:02:45.050> has<00:02:45.770> like

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
test that tomorrow the light has like

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.690 
test that tomorrow the light has like
let<00:02:46.730> me<00:02:46.820> count<00:02:47.060> them<00:02:47.560> 1<00:02:48.560> 2<00:02:48.800> 3<00:02:49.040> 4<00:02:49.400> 5<00:02:49.610> 6<00:02:50.000> 7<00:02:50.239> 8<00:02:50.630> 9<00:02:50.900> as<00:02:51.700> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
let me count them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 as a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.699 
let me count them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 as a
9<00:02:53.209> LEDs<00:02:53.780> inside<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.870> think<00:02:56.870> they<00:02:57.230> it

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
9 LEDs inside of it and I think they it

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.320 
9 LEDs inside of it and I think they it
has<00:02:57.920> some<00:02:58.100> circuitry<00:02:58.550> in<00:02:58.670> there<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.030> each

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
has some circuitry in there so that each

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.160 
has some circuitry in there so that each
one<00:02:59.600> actually<00:03:00.080> lights<00:03:00.410> by<00:03:01.250> itself<00:03:01.750> at<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.810> very

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
one actually lights by itself at a very

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.970 
one actually lights by itself at a very
fast<00:03:03.590> rate<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:04.190> goes<00:03:04.519> around<00:03:04.790> each<00:03:05.150> LED<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.989> I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
fast rate it goes around each LED and I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.470 
fast rate it goes around each LED and I
don't<00:03:07.220> think<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.940> creates<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:10.480> smooth

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
don't think that this creates a smooth

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.930 
don't think that this creates a smooth
enough<00:03:12.100> voltage<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.340> actually<00:03:13.730> make<00:03:13.910> that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
enough voltage to actually make that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.870 
enough voltage to actually make that
happen<00:03:14.299> as<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:15.140> should<00:03:15.410> but<00:03:16.100> as<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.310> pretty<00:03:16.640> cool

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
happen as it should but as a pretty cool

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.420 
happen as it should but as a pretty cool
strobing<00:03:17.390> effect<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:18.010> changes<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.220> go

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
strobing effect that changes as I go

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.400 
strobing effect that changes as I go
quicker<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.090> slower<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.720> um<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.380> actually

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
quicker and slower and it um it actually

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.970 
quicker and slower and it um it actually
works<00:03:21.950> at<00:03:22.160> relatively<00:03:22.670> low<00:03:22.790> speeds<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.200> I'm

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
works at relatively low speeds so I'm

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.410 
works at relatively low speeds so I'm
going<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.220> set<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.519> down<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.940> spin<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.299> so

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
going to set this down and spin it so

00:03:26.420 --> 00:04:11.730 
going to set this down and spin it so
you<00:03:26.510> can<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.840> what<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.019> does

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.260 

this<00:04:12.740> would<00:04:12.890> be<00:04:13.010> pretty<00:04:13.220> good<00:04:13.550> I<00:04:13.820> guess<00:04:14.120> you

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
this would be pretty good I guess you

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:23.629 
this would be pretty good I guess you
can<00:04:14.420> see<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.690> bike<00:04:14.810> from<00:04:15.050> there

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.950 

I'm<00:04:24.639> gonna<00:04:24.820> pick<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.150> front<00:04:25.479> wheel<00:04:25.660> up<00:04:25.840> and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
I'm gonna pick the front wheel up and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:40.850 
I'm gonna pick the front wheel up and
give<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.259> spin

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:52.640 

pretty<00:04:41.460> cool<00:04:41.669> strobing<00:04:42.060> effect<00:04:51.409> either<00:04:52.409> way<00:04:52.620> I

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
pretty cool strobing effect either way I

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.350 
pretty cool strobing effect either way I
think<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:53.129> I<00:04:53.220> need<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.460> do<00:04:53.639> definitely<00:04:54.180> do<00:04:54.330> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
think that I need to do definitely do a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.600 
think that I need to do definitely do a
couple<00:04:54.720> minor<00:04:54.930> changes<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:56.490> have

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
couple minor changes I just have

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.219 
couple minor changes I just have
everything<00:04:57.060> now<00:04:57.210> hose<00:04:57.419> clamp<00:04:57.720> down<00:04:57.930> here

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
everything now hose clamp down here

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.839 
everything now hose clamp down here
right<00:04:58.650> now<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.009> this<00:04:59.099> isn't<00:04:59.280> weather<00:04:59.550> proofed

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
right now and this isn't weather proofed

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.270 
right now and this isn't weather proofed
or<00:05:00.000> anything<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.629> until<00:05:01.409> I<00:05:01.440> actually<00:05:01.650> decide

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
or anything so until I actually decide

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.129 
or anything so until I actually decide
which<00:05:02.580> flash<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.270> want<00:05:03.569> and<00:05:03.750> if<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.930> want<00:05:04.110> to

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
which flash that I want and if I want to

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.260 
which flash that I want and if I want to
keep<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.500> strobe<00:05:04.830> effect<00:05:05.159> er<00:05:05.310> just<00:05:06.000> get<00:05:06.240> a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
keep this strobe effect er just get a

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.339 
keep this strobe effect er just get a
few<00:05:06.509> LEDs<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:06.960> light<00:05:07.379> brighter<00:05:09.229> I'm<00:05:10.229> not

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
few LEDs that light brighter I'm not

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.589 
few LEDs that light brighter I'm not
making<00:05:10.590> anything<00:05:10.860> from<00:05:11.159> it<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:12.300> that's<00:05:12.479> that

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
making anything from it but that's that

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.050 
making anything from it but that's that
dude<00:05:12.780> right<00:05:13.280> I'll<00:05:14.280> send<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.550> more<00:05:14.669> when<00:05:14.849> I<00:05:14.880> get

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
dude right I'll send you more when I get

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.150 
dude right I'll send you more when I get
it
