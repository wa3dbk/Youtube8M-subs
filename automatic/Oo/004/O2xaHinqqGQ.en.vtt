 welcome to my new video and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.170
 out there twice today because I think so 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.760
 weather is pretty good 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.590
 It may be that you have a few 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.940
 Wind noise in the camera but hears 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 I do not care about that now 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.330

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.510

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 case of the perks of being a 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.860
 wallflower because I have the film 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.540
 recently looked at and then is 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.310
 my favorite actor thus the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.420
 other two together and there 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.160
 neighbors I believe you think now 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.160
 somehow severely disturbed or none 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 and can 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.610
 Counter-speech is best now 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.860
 Steering wheel enters his bike into the house 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.290
 loud music or quiet I was 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.849
 actually not that loud music that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.709
 now my ears mg will be destroyed 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.330
 but not so quiet music that you can 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.489
 barely hears I would say such a thing 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.379
 Mittelding but if you are in the direction 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.180
 I'm alone at home boxing then 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.230
 he loud how long do you need in the morning 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.030
 To finish 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.620
 so when i get up i pull 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.390
 me first I need to ensure that 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.799
 usually ten minutes because of him 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.120
 then all the time fork me 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.660
 my mobile phone and first of all 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 Messages answered before that and yes 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.459
 That's why it takes about 10 minutes 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.319
 then i go to the bathroom and the stars 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.519
 I'll do that in the evening 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.959
 I need this tomorrow because of that 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.060
 less time so I need it 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.340
 ten minutes about there in the bathroom and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.400
 then I'm finished because of the reasons 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.049
 which the youtubers have become so well 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.549
 I just had fun with it then 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.349
 my camera somehow shit to build 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.060
 to film some crap with friends 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.370
 or do I stop someday 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.870
 network youtube discovered and thought so 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.180
 clock because you can tune the year 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.829
 it can look at other people and yes 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.750
 because I just made something 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.160
 and I enjoyed it and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.709
 That's why I still do that now 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.630
 well behind the online name yes my 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.519
 online name randomly that's actually 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.400
 a very simple story i knew 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.079
 do not have what to take for me 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.980
 then I'm on such louder sites like that 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.590
 random pages are gone 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.150
 name generator anything and then 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.769
 I somehow have edges in my head 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.090
 I thought somehow that 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.040
 things that I do are somehow 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.630
 changed and then I have my channel 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.490
 has called about de malley so 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.740
 actually a very simple story 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.360
 this is a book that you have read yes that 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.190
 Last thing I read was the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.650
 perks of being a wallflower that helped in 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.810
 English lessons but yes I think so 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.660
 really cool and the movie can do it too 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.220

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:46.520
 book Wilhelm Tell in German lessons 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.530
 to read the relationship between you and 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.479
 the person with whom you last sms 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:56.960

 phone provider that my internet flat 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.699
 therefore, the relationship is empty 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.360
 is based on us 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.220
 mutual actions and yes it is 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.520
