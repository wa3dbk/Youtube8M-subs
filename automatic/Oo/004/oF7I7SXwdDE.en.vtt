Superman<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.520> Infinite<00:00:11.969> Crisis

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.630 

this<00:00:16.900> looks<00:00:17.140> like<00:00:17.200> a<00:00:17.260> job<00:00:17.560> for<00:00:17.590> Superman<00:00:17.860> I

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
this looks like a job for Superman I

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.370 
this looks like a job for Superman I
feel<00:00:19.120> that<00:00:19.270> Superman<00:00:19.660> is<00:00:19.690> a<00:00:19.810> really

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
feel that Superman is a really

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.500 
feel that Superman is a really
interesting<00:00:20.680> character<00:00:21.460> because<00:00:21.700> on<00:00:22.360> the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
interesting character because on the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.020 
interesting character because on the
surface<00:00:22.690> he's<00:00:23.110> flawless<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.860> I<00:00:24.550> think<00:00:24.820> that

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
surface he's flawless and I think that

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.870 
surface he's flawless and I think that
we<00:00:25.390> as<00:00:25.510> humans<00:00:25.990> naturally<00:00:26.260> search<00:00:26.890> for<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.370> flaw

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
we as humans naturally search for a flaw

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.940 
we as humans naturally search for a flaw
I<00:00:28.360> think<00:00:28.930> that's<00:00:29.050> one<00:00:29.200> of<00:00:29.260> the<00:00:29.320> disconnections

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
I think that's one of the disconnections

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.010 
I think that's one of the disconnections
that<00:00:30.100> he<00:00:30.280> has<00:00:30.490> with<00:00:30.820> remember<00:00:31.180> he's<00:00:31.330> an<00:00:31.420> alien

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
that he has with remember he's an alien

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.860 
that he has with remember he's an alien
earth<00:00:32.529> is<00:00:32.890> my<00:00:32.920> home<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.670> go<00:00:34.660> where<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:34.960> need

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
earth is my home I go where I need

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.990 
earth is my home I go where I need
something<00:00:36.710> that<00:00:36.860> I<00:00:37.130> feel<00:00:37.670> is<00:00:37.730> very

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
something that I feel is very

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.780 
something that I feel is very
interesting<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.630> everybody<00:00:39.230> else<00:00:39.790> you

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
interesting is that everybody else you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.970 
interesting is that everybody else you
know<00:00:40.910> looks<00:00:41.660> normal<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:42.320> our<00:00:42.470> view<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:42.890> then

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
know looks normal in our view and then

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.420 
know looks normal in our view and then
puts<00:00:43.220> on<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:43.520> costume<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:45.430> specifically

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
puts on this costume this specifically

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.670 
puts on this costume this specifically
for<00:00:46.760> for<00:00:47.030> Superman<00:00:47.510> Clark<00:00:48.140> Kent<00:00:48.470> is<00:00:48.650> the

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
for for Superman Clark Kent is the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.770 
for for Superman Clark Kent is the
costume<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.120> it's<00:00:50.270> this<00:00:50.420> juxtaposition

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
costume and so it's this juxtaposition

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.830 
costume and so it's this juxtaposition
of<00:00:51.710> who<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.160> hero<00:00:52.460> is

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
of who the hero is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:06.270 
of who the hero is
and-and-and<00:00:53.840> what<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.260> mask<00:00:54.470> looks<00:00:54.890> like<00:01:04.000> I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
and-and-and what the mask looks like I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.190 
and-and-and what the mask looks like I
think<00:01:07.280> it's<00:01:07.369> always<00:01:07.640> interesting<00:01:07.910> that<00:01:08.540> when

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
think it's always interesting that when

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.870 
think it's always interesting that when
you're<00:01:09.350> not<00:01:09.500> able<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.950> be<00:01:10.070> who<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.550> really<00:01:10.580> are

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
you're not able to be who you really are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.530 
you're not able to be who you really are

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
that that presents some questions for

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.290 
that that presents some questions for
yourself<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.960> who<00:01:15.140> are<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.649> really<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:17.000> call

kind of think about this in the back you
know<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.369> then<00:01:25.580> be<00:01:25.729> able<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.940> be<00:01:26.390> presented<00:01:26.780> in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
such a game that has such possibilities

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.810 
such a game that has such possibilities
when<00:01:29.899> Superman<00:01:30.259> has<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> lot<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:30.979> varying

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
when Superman has a lot of varying

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.850 
when Superman has a lot of varying
relationships<00:01:32.420> with<00:01:32.570> Bruce<00:01:32.750> The<00:01:33.560> Brave<00:01:33.830> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
relationships with Bruce The Brave and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.430 
relationships with Bruce The Brave and
the<00:01:34.160> bold<00:01:34.250> Bruce<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.720> know<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.869> look<00:01:36.320> at

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
the bold Bruce is you know you look at

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.410 
the bold Bruce is you know you look at
this<00:01:36.590> vast<00:01:36.920> opportunity<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.789> even<00:01:38.270> within

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
this vast opportunity of even within

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.300 
this vast opportunity of even within
just<00:01:38.690> one<00:01:38.899> specific<00:01:39.110> character<00:01:39.800> how

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
just one specific character how

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.680 
just one specific character how
different<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.030> can<00:01:41.209> make<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.479> character

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
different you can make that character

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.190 
different you can make that character
and<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.619> think<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.920> Superman<00:01:43.340> represents<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and I think that Superman represents a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800 
and I think that Superman represents a
quest<00:01:45.800> within<00:01:46.039> all<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.399> us<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.789> identity<00:01:47.509> who
