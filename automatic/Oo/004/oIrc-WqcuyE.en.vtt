00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.830
 Hello people and welcome to another intervention before me 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.770
 would like to show you today as in the new world of 1 and 5 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.299
 these new busters seemed to be used we see 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.329
 So it is clear in this group 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.449
 Let's start with the crafting 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.720
 So I have had percent of nonsense of less gold by myself 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.220
 were 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 definitely more seemed that was really worth it 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.060
 So Hausen makes load on gold end customers and in the middle 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.680
 Stick and you can see that six out of six gold percent have six Hubert Reiff 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.610
 how they installed such beautiful trips destroyed in tuna minorities 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 because it is in my right world 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 have not found so much gold yet 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 and here we just build up marked 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.040
 I would also like to offer you if he happens to be a percent not so much 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.070
 Not only do not I have these words Serbia Bolt 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.320
 Pauli a little world 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 and then you can download this world ban 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.060
 so will us there 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 before now comes the booster rail take 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.690
 some one sees when one thinks main difference still happens nothing 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.670
 That's because it needs a growth impulse 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.300
 ThyssenKrupp will do it for 200 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.950
 the sit there and also Nuremberg's sound out of print until 10 Test de reported that 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.750
 Team works 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 ZhongDe enough space 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 and hoping to do more with his pro ride 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.700
 and as you can see she does not seem to be Amsterdam yet so that is 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.870
 not so strong 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.310
 how the Pustertaler change ca 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370
 yes multiplayer 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 That's why you must never appear 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 what about the one to Trier 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.860
 so Russo twice gold 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.559
 Koussa to Mainka Brocade 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.379
 Let's try that again 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.379
 and now we are coming up but also difficult 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:20.889
 that is why these secondly appeared rather not for Berghof but yes 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.299
 for longer distances 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.529
 i'm building a little world here now 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.049
 and that could be the first author and it just tries a bit around 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
 I hope I could help you plus us 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.209
 IxLoad again a small attachment 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.200
 Process day in a park example that's what i showed this and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.489
 under the earth 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.339
 I do not have it like that here 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.449
 even under the earth has broken through here so rich 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.779
 However, you can also put down a lot of growth, so this can now also 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.599
 keeping an eye out 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.809
 or you can start looking right next month months off 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:05.159
 So you can go to other clinics doctors without limits 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.969
 you have to take care of me and dig summer makes New Schwander take 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.989
 Dream and the Wars Plunderings from Dinnebier I'll ask you now 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.779
 to disposal 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.779
 you like the opportunity to try the room a bit 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.859
 not here 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.369
 look forward to the inventory a bit more 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.029
 meets us
