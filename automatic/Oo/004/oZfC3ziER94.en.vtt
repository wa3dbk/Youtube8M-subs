they're just gonna sort of inertia and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.320 
they're just gonna sort of inertia and
on<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.720> left<00:04:26.870> hand<00:04:26.960> side<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.699> she<00:04:28.699> come<00:04:28.910> fully

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.760 
on the left hand side and she come fully
sideways<00:04:29.810> right<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.080> front<00:04:30.199> of<00:04:30.259> me<00:04:30.350> over<00:04:30.410> war

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
sideways right in front of me over war

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.060 
sideways right in front of me over war
we<00:04:31.009> were<00:04:31.100> gonna<00:04:31.220> go<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.610> know<00:04:31.759> and<00:04:32.620> lucky<00:04:33.620> and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
we were gonna go you know and lucky and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.330 
we were gonna go you know and lucky and
you<00:04:34.370> know<00:04:34.520> t-bone<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.270> go<00:04:35.360> straight<00:04:35.570> through

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
you know t-bone and go straight through

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.890 
you know t-bone and go straight through
yeah<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.550> was<00:04:37.669> ended<00:04:37.970> up<00:04:38.060> being<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.300> rerun<00:04:38.600> I

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
yeah it was ended up being a rerun I

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.610 
yeah it was ended up being a rerun I
think<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:40.060> depends<00:04:41.060> how<00:04:41.840> they<00:04:42.139> you<00:04:42.440> know<00:04:42.560> you

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
think it depends how they you know you

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.330 
think it depends how they you know you
look<00:04:43.009> at<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.160> could've<00:04:43.729> gone<00:04:43.820> either<00:04:43.880> way<00:04:45.340> so

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
look at it could've gone either way so

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.100 
look at it could've gone either way so
yeah<00:04:46.610> but<00:04:46.820> everyone<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.449> know<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.599> think<00:04:47.960> I

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
yeah but everyone you know I think I

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.400 
yeah but everyone you know I think I
think<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.889> fair<00:04:49.099> fair<00:04:49.460> way<00:04:49.639> to<00:04:49.669> do<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.410> you

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
think it's a fair fair way to do it you

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.490 
think it's a fair fair way to do it you
know<00:04:51.530> it's<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:52.039> a<00:04:52.160> challenge<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.820> battle

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
know it's it's a challenge to battle

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.659 
know it's it's a challenge to battle
cars<00:04:54.500> like<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:55.009> know<00:04:55.130> they're<00:04:55.400> actually

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
cars like that you know they're actually

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.240 
cars like that you know they're actually
harder<00:04:55.940> than<00:04:56.090> battling<00:04:56.539> in<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.690> finals<00:04:57.250> so

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
harder than battling in the finals so

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.719 
harder than battling in the finals so
yeah<00:04:59.180> made<00:04:59.780> me<00:04:59.930> work<00:05:00.110> for<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.590> yeah<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.639> the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
yeah made me work for it and yeah in the

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.089 
yeah made me work for it and yeah in the
in<00:05:01.820> Darren<00:05:02.090> Kelly<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.750> was<00:05:03.590> pretty<00:05:03.800> happy<00:05:04.039> with

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
in Darren Kelly I was pretty happy with

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.390 
in Darren Kelly I was pretty happy with
my<00:05:04.160> runs<00:05:04.460> I<00:05:05.320> stacked<00:05:06.320> on<00:05:06.500> heaps<00:05:06.770> angle<00:05:07.220> when<00:05:07.340> I

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
my runs I stacked on heaps angle when I

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.189 
my runs I stacked on heaps angle when I
come<00:05:07.610> over<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.880> hill<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.539> was<00:05:08.570> pretty<00:05:08.870> slow

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
come over the hill and I was pretty slow

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.499 
come over the hill and I was pretty slow
I<00:05:09.410> could<00:05:09.530> feel<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.979> car<00:05:10.160> was<00:05:10.280> slow<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:10.729> mean

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
I could feel the car was slow I mean

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.570 
I could feel the car was slow I mean
maybe<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.990> was<00:05:12.110> a<00:05:12.139> bad<00:05:12.410> choice<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:13.009> do<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.160> and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
maybe it was a bad choice to do that and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:32.050 
maybe it was a bad choice to do that and
he<00:05:13.849> was<00:05:14.000> right<00:05:14.360> on<00:05:14.389> me

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.719 

sometimes<00:05:33.060> when<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.690> do<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.740> car<00:05:35.520> like

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
sometimes when you do that a car like

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.610 
sometimes when you do that a car like
that<00:05:35.759> might<00:05:36.449> have<00:05:36.570> had<00:05:36.690> too<00:05:36.870> much<00:05:36.900> crap<00:05:37.320> and

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
that might have had too much crap and

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.379 
that might have had too much crap and
straighten<00:05:38.430> made<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.639> mistake<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.240> that's

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
straighten made a mistake and that's

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.860 
straighten made a mistake and that's
what<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.660> saw<00:05:39.960> sort<00:05:40.410> of<00:05:40.500> hope<00:05:40.620> for<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.220> term<00:05:42.090> for

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
what I saw sort of hope for the term for

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.680 
what I saw sort of hope for the term for
it<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.050> go<00:05:43.169> that<00:05:43.380> way<00:05:43.759> but<00:05:44.759> I'm<00:05:45.000> yeah<00:05:45.330> I<00:05:45.360> mean<00:05:45.570> he

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
it to go that way but I'm yeah I mean he

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.170 
it to go that way but I'm yeah I mean he
pulled<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.020> off<00:05:46.139> pretty<00:05:46.289> good<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:48.060> know

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
pulled it off pretty good and you know

very<00:06:02.550> little<00:06:02.850> with<00:06:03.000> this<00:06:03.180> car<00:06:03.389> you<00:06:03.419> know<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
very little with this car you know the

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.740 
very little with this car you know the
voice<00:06:03.870> struggle<00:06:04.350> does<00:06:04.500> then<00:06:05.479> bring<00:06:06.479> on<00:06:06.630> the

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
voice struggle does then bring on the

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.540 
voice struggle does then bring on the
new<00:06:06.900> car<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.289> the<00:06:07.410> you<00:06:07.650> know<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:08.070> better

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
new car and the you know a better

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.029 
new car and the you know a better
suspension<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.479> better<00:06:10.139> handling<00:06:10.350> and<00:06:10.650> stuff

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
suspension and better handling and stuff

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.250 
suspension and better handling and stuff
like<00:06:11.190> that<00:06:11.400> and<00:06:11.550> you<00:06:12.150> know<00:06:12.180> we<00:06:12.419> sort<00:06:12.660> of<00:06:12.720> work

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
like that and you know we sort of work

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.250 
like that and you know we sort of work
the<00:06:13.410> new<00:06:13.590> car<00:06:13.800> where<00:06:14.120> we're<00:06:15.120> building<00:06:15.360> what<00:06:16.110> we

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
the new car where we're building what we

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.300 
the new car where we're building what we
found<00:06:16.440> wrong<00:06:16.650> with<00:06:16.800> this<00:06:16.889> one

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
found wrong with this one

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:47.559 
found wrong with this one
and<00:06:17.630> you<00:06:18.630> know<00:06:18.750> it's

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.200 

and<00:06:48.569> I<00:06:49.139> think<00:06:49.199> we<00:06:49.889> would<00:06:50.069> have<00:06:50.189> finished<00:06:50.370> round
