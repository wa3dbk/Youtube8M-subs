00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
nice space for a driver the back is even

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.980 
nice space for a driver the back is even
better<00:01:04.449> oh<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:07.390> one<00:01:07.570> bad<00:01:07.780> part<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.820> breaks

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.720 

that's<00:01:12.759> peaks<00:01:13.759> of<00:01:14.060> work<00:01:14.390> okay

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
that's peaks of work okay

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.040 
that's peaks of work okay
and<00:01:15.880> in<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.900> back<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.840> warning<00:01:19.840> tape

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
and in the back you have warning tape

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.620 
and in the back you have warning tape
and<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:21.490> engine<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:21.910> looks<00:01:22.360> realistic<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and an engine that looks realistic and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.220 
and an engine that looks realistic and
the<00:01:25.630> front<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.680> looks<00:01:26.920> good<00:01:27.990> except<00:01:28.990> for<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
the front this looks good except for the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.350 
the front this looks good except for the
light<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.680> think<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.250> should<00:01:30.640> have<00:01:30.790> been<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.210> the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
light I think it should have been in the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.160 
light I think it should have been in the
middle<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:33.330> actually<00:01:34.330> looks<00:01:34.720> pretty<00:01:34.840> good<00:01:35.110> in

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
middle but actually looks pretty good in

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.910 
middle but actually looks pretty good in
