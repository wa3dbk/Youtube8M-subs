shabbat bazooka okay Josh and I am going
to<00:00:06.240> be<00:00:06.359> telling<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.779> about<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.170> scientific

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
to be telling you about a scientific

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.419 
to be telling you about a scientific
video<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.760> Earth's<00:00:09.230> atmosphere<00:00:10.230> PS<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
video of Earth's atmosphere PS this is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
video of Earth's atmosphere PS this is
for<00:00:11.790> science<00:00:13.370> so<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.790> all<00:00:15.750> know<00:00:15.780> an

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
for science so as you all know an

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.470 
for science so as you all know an
atmosphere<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:18.500> basically<00:00:19.699> what<00:00:20.699> supports<00:00:21.240> us

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
atmosphere is basically what supports us

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.259 
atmosphere is basically what supports us
and<00:00:21.750> earth<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.920> would<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.670> had<00:00:23.730> an

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and earth if we would not have had an

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.560 
and earth if we would not have had an
atmosphere<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:25.109> would<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.439> fry<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.699> earth

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
atmosphere we would all fry and earth

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.349 
atmosphere we would all fry and earth
would<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.109> never<00:00:29.099> been<00:00:29.490> able<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.029> support

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
would have never been able to support

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
would have never been able to support
anything<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.349> um<00:00:31.880> kind<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.090> Mars<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
anything so be um kind of like Mars and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.110 
anything so be um kind of like Mars and
I<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:34.020> people<00:00:34.290> say<00:00:34.680> omar's<00:00:35.610> used<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> have

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
I know people say omar's used to have

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.170 
I know people say omar's used to have
water<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.899> still<00:00:37.320> none<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.430> ultraviolet

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
water but still none of the ultraviolet

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
water but still none of the ultraviolet
rays<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.890> secure<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.700> no<00:00:42.120> more<00:00:42.719> life<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.290> ever

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
rays are secure so no more life is ever

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.760 
rays are secure so no more life is ever
met<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.489> never<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.530> ever

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
met or never going to be on there ever

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.869 
met or never going to be on there ever
again<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:48.739> atmosphere<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.280> made<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
again our atmosphere is also made up of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.860 
again our atmosphere is also made up of
solids<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> liquids<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.329> gases<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.690> I'm

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
solids and liquids and gases but I'm

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.209 
solids and liquids and gases but I'm
going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.230> talking<00:00:55.410> about<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
going to be talking about them in the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.619 
going to be talking about them in the
next<00:00:56.399> slide<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> solids<00:00:59.629> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
next slide but we have solids and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.130 
next slide but we have solids and
liquids<00:01:01.170> such<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.620> dust<00:01:02.309> sea<00:01:03.000> salt<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> water

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
droplets the sea salts from the sea the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
droplets the sea salts from the sea the
dust<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> particles<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:11.010> earth

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
dust is from all the particles in earth

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.510 
dust is from all the particles in earth
and<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.240> water<00:01:12.450> droplets<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.080> from

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
and the water droplets is from

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
and the water droplets is from
precipitation<00:01:14.520> otherwise<00:01:15.150> known<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.450> rain

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
precipitation otherwise known as rain

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.109 
precipitation otherwise known as rain
building<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.330> evaporating<00:01:18.330> our

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
building up and evaporating our

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
building up and evaporating our
atmosphere<00:01:21.119> also<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:22.080> gases<00:01:22.710> such<00:01:23.369> as

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
atmosphere also have gases such as

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.620 
atmosphere also have gases such as
nitrogen<00:01:24.080> oxygen<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.409> carbon<00:01:25.710> dioxide

nitrogen oxygen and carbon dioxide

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
nitrogen oxygen and carbon dioxide
nitrogen<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> plants<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.280> how<00:01:29.430> they

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
nitrogen is for the plants and how they

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
nitrogen is for the plants and how they
grow<00:01:30.079> oxygen<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.590> plants<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> animals

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
grow oxygen is for plants and animals

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.469 
grow oxygen is for plants and animals
and<00:01:33.530> carbon<00:01:34.530> dioxide<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.220> four<00:01:35.490> points<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and carbon dioxide is four points to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.010 
and carbon dioxide is four points to
make<00:01:36.659> food<00:01:37.049> okay<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.220> oxygen<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.689> we

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
make food okay now oxygen is what we

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.060 
make food okay now oxygen is what we
breathe<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:41.180> animals<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.659> us<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:43.500> breathe<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
breathe in animals like us we breathe in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.749 
breathe in animals like us we breathe in
oxygen<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.090> plants<00:01:45.720> breathe<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.710> oxygen<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
oxygen but plants breathe out oxygen and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.580 
oxygen but plants breathe out oxygen and
we<00:01:48.450> breathe<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.430> animals<00:01:50.430> breathe<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.970> come

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
we breathe out animals breathe out come

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
we breathe out animals breathe out come
dioxide<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.159> plants<00:01:53.460> breathe<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.119> carbon

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
dioxide but plants breathe in carbon

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.770 
dioxide but plants breathe in carbon
dioxide<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:56.310> these<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.329> gasses

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
dioxide this these are all the gasses

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719 
dioxide this these are all the gasses
and<00:01:57.810> solids<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.439> liquids<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.460> in

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and solids and liquids that we have in

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.620 
and solids and liquids that we have in
our<00:01:59.880> atmosphere<00:02:01.759> okay<00:02:02.759> next<00:02:02.969> we're<00:02:03.270> starting

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
our atmosphere okay next we're starting

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.089 
our atmosphere okay next we're starting
to<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> atmosphere<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:05.899> structure

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
to get to the atmosphere is structure

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.219 
to get to the atmosphere is structure
okay<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> first<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.989> are

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
okay so the first two that we have are

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.330 
okay so the first two that we have are
the<00:02:10.940> troposphere

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
the troposphere

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.750 
the troposphere
and<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.810> stratosphere<00:02:13.890> now<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> troposphere

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and the stratosphere now the troposphere

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000 
and the stratosphere now the troposphere
is<00:02:15.970> where<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.750> live<00:02:17.019> it's<00:02:17.260> basically<00:02:17.769> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
is where we live it's basically a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.170 
is where we live it's basically a
surface<00:02:18.879> so<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.310> where<00:02:21.519> weather

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
surface so and this is where weather

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.640 
surface so and this is where weather
occurs<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> lot<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.910> stratosphere<00:02:25.810> if<00:02:25.989> any

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
occurs a lot and the stratosphere if any

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.190 
occurs a lot and the stratosphere if any
of<00:02:26.800> y'all<00:02:27.040> heard<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> strato<00:02:28.180> jump<00:02:28.810> was

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
of y'all heard what the strato jump was

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.160 
of y'all heard what the strato jump was
um<00:02:29.709> as<00:02:29.950> when<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> man<00:02:30.970> beat<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.660> world<00:02:31.870> record

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
um as when a man beat the world record

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
is in the lower part so it remains

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.620
