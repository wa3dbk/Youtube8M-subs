how<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.510> advanced<00:00:54.809> warfare<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
how you can get advanced warfare for a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
how you can get advanced warfare for a
lot<00:00:55.770> cheaper<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> method<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.820> get

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
lot cheaper so the method of get

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.340 
lot cheaper so the method of get
advanced<00:00:57.300> warfare<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> lot<00:00:57.899> cheaper<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
advanced warfare a lot cheaper is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
advanced warfare a lot cheaper is
actually<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> very<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.219> simple<00:00:59.489> method<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
actually a very very simple method is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
actually a very very simple method is
something<00:01:00.359> people<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
something people know about but you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
something people know about but you
don't<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:03.180> since<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
don't really do it because since it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
don't really do it because since it
what's<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.379> came<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.769> ps4<00:01:05.280> team<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.549> people

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
what's one came on ps4 team up people

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.429 
what's one came on ps4 team up people

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.440 
are just being caught up in the haight
and<00:01:07.770> nobody's<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.460> done<00:01:08.670> any<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.210> these

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and nobody's really done any of these

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
and nobody's really done any of these
things<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.439> fifa<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> did<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
things but for fifa as you did this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850

method<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.450> fifa<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:13.200> cheaper<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
method to get fifa a lot cheaper and

method to get fifa a lot cheaper and
also<00:01:14.340> earlier<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.060> method<00:01:15.390> works<00:01:15.600> very

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
also earlier and this method works very

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
also earlier and this method works very
very<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> thing<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.790> is
