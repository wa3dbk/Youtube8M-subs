I love dramatically frame statement
mirrors<00:00:07.350> but<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.710> always<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> price<00:00:08.370> that

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
mirrors but not always the price that

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.310 
mirrors but not always the price that
goes<00:00:08.580> along<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:09.000> them<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:09.750> I've<00:00:09.870> decided<00:00:09.990> to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
goes along with them so I've decided to

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
goes along with them so I've decided to
try<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> tackle<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.070> myself<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> bunch

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
try to tackle one myself I have a bunch

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.789 
try to tackle one myself I have a bunch
of<00:00:12.630> great<00:00:12.719> crown<00:00:12.990> moulding<00:00:13.380> left<00:00:13.559> from<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
of great crown moulding left from a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.959 
of great crown moulding left from a
photo<00:00:14.009> shoot<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.370> did<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.790> thought

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
photo shoot that I did and I thought

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.019 
photo shoot that I did and I thought
this<00:00:15.089> would<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.240> perfect<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> frame

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
this would be perfect to make the frame

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.490 
this would be perfect to make the frame
so<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> start<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.449> project<00:00:18.720> you're<00:00:19.320> first

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
so to start this project you're first

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.750 
so to start this project you're first
need<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> find<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.310> mirror

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
need to find a mirror

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.010 
need to find a mirror
I<00:00:20.789> found<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.270> mirror<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.539> home<00:00:21.630> hardware

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I found this mirror at home hardware

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.109 
I found this mirror at home hardware
it's<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.500> great<00:00:22.680> beveled<00:00:23.010> mirror<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.880> very

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it's a great beveled mirror it's very

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.570 
it's a great beveled mirror it's very
inexpensive<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.859> base<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.340> mirror

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
inexpensive so the base for this mirror

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.370 
inexpensive so the base for this mirror
is<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> piece<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> plywood<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:28.050> had

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
is going to be a piece of plywood I had

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
is going to be a piece of plywood I had
this<00:00:28.529> plywood<00:00:28.740> cut<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.279> Home<00:00:29.369> Hardware<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
this plywood cut at Home Hardware to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.790 
this plywood cut at Home Hardware to
size<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.900> accommodate<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.410> mirror<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
size to accommodate the mirror that I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
size to accommodate the mirror that I
chose<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.369> left<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.940> 4<00:00:33.239> inch<00:00:33.270> band<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
chose I left about a 4 inch band of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
chose I left about a 4 inch band of
plywood<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.500> either<00:00:34.620> side<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> mirror

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
plywood on either side of the mirror

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.340 
plywood on either side of the mirror
that<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:36.090> I'll<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.329> something<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:37.020> nail<00:00:37.140> my

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that way I'll have something to nail my

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
that way I'll have something to nail my
molding<00:00:37.680> down<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.579> part

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
molding down to when I get to that part

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.729 
molding down to when I get to that part
so<00:00:39.570> we're<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> measure<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> plywood<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so we're going to measure the plywood to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.790 
so we're going to measure the plywood to
find<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> center<00:00:41.309> point

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.990 

now<00:00:47.800> we<00:00:47.859> know<00:00:48.100> exactly<00:00:48.250> where<00:00:48.760> I'm<00:00:48.850> your

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
now we know exactly where I'm your

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.630 
now we know exactly where I'm your
should<00:00:49.180> line<00:00:49.359> up<00:00:49.390> wants<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.079> glue<00:00:50.289> it<00:00:50.410> down<00:00:50.640> so

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
should line up wants to glue it down so

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.799 
should line up wants to glue it down so
now<00:00:51.760> I'm<00:00:51.850> going<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.089> apply<00:00:52.210> some<00:00:52.269> no<00:00:52.629> more

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
now I'm going to apply some no more

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.569 
now I'm going to apply some no more
nails<00:00:53.019> he<00:00:53.379> slips<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.829> back<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.370> mirror

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
nails he slips the back of the mirror

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.910 
nails he slips the back of the mirror
and<00:00:54.879> we're<00:00:55.480> going<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.629> apply<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:55.989> all<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.769> way

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
and we're going to apply it all the way

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.060 
and we're going to apply it all the way
on<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.489> edges<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:58.059> mirror<00:01:01.979> and<00:01:02.979> then

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
on the edges of the mirror and then

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.590 
on the edges of the mirror and then
we're<00:01:03.159> going<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.309> run<00:01:03.640> some<00:01:03.879> across<00:01:04.420> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
we're going to run some across the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.719 
we're going to run some across the
middle<00:01:04.869> so<00:01:05.530> there<00:01:05.680> here's<00:01:05.979> firmly<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
middle so there here's firmly to the

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.310 
middle so there here's firmly to the
plywood<00:01:07.049> once<00:01:08.049> we<00:01:08.200> put<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.470> down<00:01:09.899> okay<00:01:10.899> so<00:01:11.080> now

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
plywood once we put it down okay so now

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.910 
plywood once we put it down okay so now
we're<00:01:11.470> going<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.619> glue<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.860> together

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
we're going to glue it together

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.080 
we're going to glue it together
just<00:01:14.920> want<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.100> make<00:01:15.220> sure<00:01:15.399> we<00:01:15.580> line<00:01:15.789> up<00:01:15.820> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
just want to make sure we line up the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.059 
just want to make sure we line up the
bottom<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.750> mirror<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.770> sides

is yousef dry about 20 minutes before

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.779 
is yousef dry about 20 minutes before
you<00:01:23.380> begin<00:01:23.710> applying<00:01:24.069> moldings<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.610> the

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
you begin applying moldings to the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.630 
you begin applying moldings to the
mirror<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.590> protect<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.009> mirror<00:01:27.340> from

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
mirror so to protect this mirror from

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.490 
mirror so to protect this mirror from
any<00:01:27.789> paint<00:01:28.119> or<00:01:28.300> glue<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.690> may<00:01:28.840> get<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.289> I'm

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
any paint or glue that may get on it I'm

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.320 
any paint or glue that may get on it I'm
going<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.710> cover<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.069> edges<00:01:30.190> with<00:01:31.090> green

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
going to cover the edges with green

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:42.790 
going to cover the edges with green
painters<00:01:31.750> tape<00:01:31.929> before<00:01:32.289> I<00:01:32.440> start

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.720 

so<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.890> first<00:01:44.070> piece<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.370> will<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.580> I'm<00:01:44.640> going

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
so the first piece of will be I'm going

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.370 
so the first piece of will be I'm going
to<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.270> thin<00:01:45.600> three-quarter<00:01:46.230> inch

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to use the thin three-quarter inch

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.720 
to use the thin three-quarter inch
decorative<00:01:46.650> molding<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.370> I<00:01:47.400> think<00:01:47.610> will

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
decorative molding that I think will

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.040 
decorative molding that I think will
make<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.910> nice<00:01:48.120> transition<00:01:48.540> between<00:01:48.870> the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
make a nice transition between the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.200 
make a nice transition between the
mirror<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> plywood<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.910> it's<00:01:51.060> such

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
mirror and the plywood because it's such

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.000 
mirror and the plywood because it's such
a<00:01:51.240> thin<00:01:51.390> molding<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.560> won't<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.830> to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
a thin molding we really won't have to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.070 
a thin molding we really won't have to
use<00:01:53.040> nails<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:53.610> secure<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.120> we<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.750> use<00:01:54.930> our

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
use nails to secure it we can use our

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.950 
use nails to secure it we can use our
construction<00:01:55.500> adhesive<00:01:55.590> again<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:57.840> going

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
construction adhesive again so I'm going

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.210 
construction adhesive again so I'm going
to<00:01:58.020> run<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> thin<00:01:58.350> bead<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.770> construction

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
to run a thin bead of construction

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.460 
to run a thin bead of construction
adhesive<00:01:59.810> along<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> back<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.920> molding

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
adhesive along the back of the molding

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.900 
adhesive along the back of the molding
we<00:02:04.470> want<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.710> make<00:02:04.800> sure<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.130> push<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.550> molding

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
we want to make sure we push the molding

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.670 
we want to make sure we push the molding
flush<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.660> against<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.140> edge<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.440> mirror

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
flush up against the edge of the mirror

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.440 
flush up against the edge of the mirror
and<00:02:07.940> push<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> down<00:02:09.330> nice<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.050> firmly<00:02:11.450> now

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and push it down nice and firmly now

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.610 
and push it down nice and firmly now
we're<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> do<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> same<00:02:12.959> thing<00:02:13.260> with

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
we're going to do the same thing with

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.030 
we're going to do the same thing with
the<00:02:13.709> other<00:02:13.800> three<00:02:14.070> pieces<00:02:21.410> all<00:02:22.410> these<00:02:22.680> corners

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the other three pieces all these corners

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.500 
the other three pieces all these corners
have<00:02:23.220> been<00:02:23.250> mitered<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> 45<00:02:24.180> degree<00:02:24.360> angle

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
have been mitered on a 45 degree angle

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:36.260 
have been mitered on a 45 degree angle
so<00:02:25.380> they<00:02:25.530> should<00:02:25.920> fit<00:02:26.580> together<00:02:26.970> perfectly

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.339 

so<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.599> crown<00:02:37.780> molding<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.230> I'm

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
so this is the crown molding that I'm

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.380 
so this is the crown molding that I'm
using<00:02:38.500> for<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.920> frame<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.819> it's<00:02:39.940> six<00:02:40.150> inches

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
using for the frame so it's six inches

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.420 
using for the frame so it's six inches
wide<00:02:40.450> has<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.140> great<00:02:41.500> detail<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.250> think

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
wide has this great detail that I think

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.680 
wide has this great detail that I think
is<00:02:42.520> going<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> look<00:02:42.819> great<00:02:43.030> once<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.540> painted

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
is going to look great once it's painted

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.320 
is going to look great once it's painted
out<00:02:44.280> when<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.400> installing<00:02:45.550> crown<00:02:45.940> molding

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
out when you're installing crown molding

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.699 
out when you're installing crown molding
unlike<00:02:46.690> other<00:02:46.840> moldings<00:02:47.349> you're<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.620> be

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
unlike other moldings you're going to be

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.890 
unlike other moldings you're going to be
installing<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.400> its<00:02:48.580> edge<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:49.480> so

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
installing it on its edge like this so

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.780 
installing it on its edge like this so
when<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.140> make<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.620> mitered<00:02:50.890> cuts<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.640> want

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
when you make the mitered cuts you want

use some painters tape to tape the back
of<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> corners<00:03:51.740> this<00:03:52.740> will<00:03:52.980> hold<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.280> in

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
of the corners this will hold it in

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:02.150 
of the corners this will hold it in
place<00:03:54.170> while<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.230> glue<00:03:55.530> dries<00:04:00.950> I've<00:04:01.950> also

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
place while the glue dries I've also

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.190 
place while the glue dries I've also
added<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.670> finishing<00:04:03.090> nail<00:04:03.240> to<00:04:03.510> each<00:04:03.660> corner<00:04:03.990> to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
added a finishing nail to each corner to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.480 
added a finishing nail to each corner to
make<00:04:04.290> sure<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.830> mitered<00:04:05.070> edges<00:04:05.340> are

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490

make sure that all the mitered edges are
nice<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.850> secure<00:04:06.050> so<00:04:07.050> now<00:04:07.170> because

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
nice and secure so now because

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.260 
nice and secure so now because
everything<00:04:07.980> doesn't<00:04:08.250> always<00:04:08.400> line<00:04:08.760> up<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.180> we

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
everything doesn't always line up and we

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.760 
everything doesn't always line up and we
do<00:04:09.420> need<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.600> hide<00:04:09.870> some<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.350> countersunk

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
do need to hide some of the countersunk

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.560 
do need to hide some of the countersunk
nails<00:04:11.070> I'm<00:04:11.310> going<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.610> use<00:04:11.760> my<00:04:11.880> wood<00:04:12.030> filler<00:04:12.270> to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
that the wood filler gets inside all the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.370 
that the wood filler gets inside all the
cracks<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.810> good<00:04:18.930> thing<00:04:19.049> about<00:04:19.079> wood

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
cracks and the good thing about wood

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.900 
cracks and the good thing about wood
filler<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.280> paintable<00:04:20.640> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
filler is that it's paintable and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
sandable

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.320 
sandable

don't scratch the wood molding you want

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.909 
don't scratch the wood molding you want
to<00:04:30.510> make<00:04:30.630> sure<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.140> into<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.740> nooks

to make sure you get into all the nooks
and<00:04:32.100> corners<00:04:32.340> if<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.300> have<00:04:33.390> nice<00:04:33.570> smooth

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
edges now ready to paint and I've chosen

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.810 
edges now ready to paint and I've chosen
this<00:04:38.790> great<00:04:39.030> Beauty<00:04:39.390> tone<00:04:39.540> color<00:04:39.810> called<00:04:40.169> ink

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
this great Beauty tone color called ink

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.510 
this great Beauty tone color called ink
it's<00:04:41.820> an<00:04:41.970> almost<00:04:42.720> black<00:04:43.169> color<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.190> think

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
it's an almost black color that I think

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.170 
it's an almost black color that I think
would<00:04:44.610> look<00:04:44.700> great<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.150> any<00:04:45.330> room<00:04:47.000> so<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.060> want

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
would look great in any room so you want

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.880 
would look great in any room so you want
to<00:04:48.240> make<00:04:48.330> sure<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.020> get<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.169> nice<00:04:49.560> amount<00:04:49.800> of

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
to make sure you get a nice amount of

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.280 
to make sure you get a nice amount of
paint<00:04:50.070> on<00:04:50.130> your<00:04:50.190> brush<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:51.110> because<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.229> is

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
paint on your brush and because this is

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.409 
paint on your brush and because this is
a<00:04:52.410> really<00:04:52.620> detailed<00:04:53.100> molding<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:54.180> want<00:04:54.360> to

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
a really detailed molding you want to

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.840 
a really detailed molding you want to
make<00:04:54.510> sure<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:55.080> get<00:04:55.290> inside<00:04:55.620> all<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.669> little

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
make sure you get inside all the little

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:05.200 
make sure you get inside all the little
nooks<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.180> crannies

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.120 

so<00:05:06.210> I've<00:05:06.330> chosen<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:07.020> latex<00:05:07.410> paint<00:05:07.740> with<00:05:08.010> an

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
so I've chosen a latex paint with an

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.100 
so I've chosen a latex paint with an
eggshell<00:05:08.280> finish<00:05:08.700> because<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.630> really<00:05:09.900> didn't

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
eggshell finish because I really didn't

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.110 
eggshell finish because I really didn't
want<00:05:10.140> it<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.530> be<00:05:10.620> too<00:05:10.800> shiny<00:05:11.070> in<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.400> end

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.330 

so<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.390> first<00:05:15.630> coats<00:05:15.870> done<00:05:16.200> now<00:05:17.070> we'll

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
so the first coats done now we'll

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.440 
so the first coats done now we'll
probably<00:05:17.490> need<00:05:17.700> to<00:05:17.760> give<00:05:17.880> it<00:05:17.940> about<00:05:18.030> two<00:05:18.300> more

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
probably need to give it about two more

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.970 
probably need to give it about two more
coats<00:05:18.720> before<00:05:18.960> we<00:05:19.200> get<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.380> finish<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.680> we

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
coats before we get the finish that we

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.480 
coats before we get the finish that we
want

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
want

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.190 
want
I<00:05:20.520> think<00:05:21.150> this<00:05:21.330> mirror<00:05:21.570> has<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> really<00:05:22.020> great

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
I think this mirror has a really great

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.870 
I think this mirror has a really great
presence<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:23.370> would<00:05:23.490> have<00:05:23.610> good<00:05:23.760> in<00:05:23.820> the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
presence to it it would have good in the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.060 
presence to it it would have good in the
front<00:05:24.150> hall<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.480> bedroom<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.170> we<00:05:25.650> really<00:05:25.890> just

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
front hall a bedroom and we really just

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.650 
front hall a bedroom and we really just
add<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.250> little<00:05:26.640> bit<00:05:26.730> of<00:05:26.790> extra<00:05:26.970> drama<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.540> any

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
add a little bit of extra drama to any

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.180 
add a little bit of extra drama to any
room<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:27.960> your<00:05:27.990> house

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190
