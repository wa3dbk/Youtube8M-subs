00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.770 
then just put some masking tape up there
I<00:02:49.320> would<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.739> showed<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.850> my<00:02:51.299> dad<00:02:51.570> put

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
them up there really quickly so I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400 
them up there really quickly so I
couldn't<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.600> then<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.840> want<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.110> keep<00:02:55.230> them

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
couldn't and then you want to keep them

couldn't and then you want to keep them
on<00:02:55.560> overnight<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.820> then<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.299> put<00:02:57.450> them

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570
