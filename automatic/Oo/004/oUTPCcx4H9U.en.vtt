00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.170 

first<00:00:51.440> step<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.219> paper<00:00:52.489> in<00:00:52.670> half<00:00:52.910> this

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
first step for the paper in half this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:03.649 
first step for the paper in half this
way

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.020 

stab<00:01:04.659> from<00:01:04.960> this<00:01:05.140> edge<00:01:05.470> for<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.700> center

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
stab from this edge for to the center

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
stab from this edge for to the center
crease

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 

then<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> repeat<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> scent<00:01:16.350> step<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
then you repeat a scent step to the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.319 
then you repeat a scent step to the
other<00:01:17.490> side

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.999

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
estimate about one inch and a half

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:52.950 
estimate about one inch and a half
from<00:02:44.030> here<00:02:44.659> to<00:02:45.079> here
