 for a moment on your computer 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.680
 alfredo talavera who is the best 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.719
 goalkeeper right now and better 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.250

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.920
 honey scheme or do not mix it in a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 free love I do not believe for sure I think that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.129
 here we all have the same opportunity 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.670
 and you have to show match by match 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.050
 Rafael Marquez experience and leadership 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.760
 will be the captain of the tri in the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.420
 of the world there is not much time also 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.900
 to be experiencing so good 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.800
 that gives us continuity and we go 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 knowing even more 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.300
 Hector Moreno the best defense of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 Mexican football nowadays 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.060
 Francisco Rodríguez the most criticized 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.550
 but above it adds to its best quality 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.480
 always more always more we are going to more 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.430
 miguel layún speed delivers quality and 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.220
 heart you have to keep looking for a good 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.960
 working looking for things 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.330
 continue to improve the understanding of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 group and paul aguilar the best lateral 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.220
 of the restless Aztec football good 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 centers and improve the offensive the state 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.750
 globally the motivation of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.240
 all players he is the most there is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.150
 André saved the experience and quality 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 it is not in doubt it does not go through its best 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.860
 moment you have to show that you still 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.080
 we are useful for the selection that I had 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.230
 we can be able to earn a place 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.450
 here juan carlos medina speed and 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.440
 control of the midfield man of Miguel 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.330
 Herrera I have to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.500
 that I have to keep working very 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.160
 strong 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.130
 I do not have to really feel safe 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.040
 Carlos Peña offensive power imbalance 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.100
 and physical infallible in the alignment of 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.590
 most committed technician that has better 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.940
 level of play in that position and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.180
 let's hope it 's a good competition 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.580
 internal jose juan vázquez versatility and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.970
 one of the surprises of the list based 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.320
 at work you have to be working 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.750
 also here take the opportunity 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.660
 who gives us and does his best 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.390
 mountains touch and quality management 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.370
 midfield another starter in the world cup is 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.810
 important to do well and above all I know 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.720
 that working in the club the same 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.940
 way hector herrera his versatility in 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.550
 positions and control quality in half 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.230
 field do get on Brazil 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.930
 playing in Europe does not guarantee you a place 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.140
 in the selection 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.790
 I think you have to work and place 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.420
 in the selection I think you have it 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.189
 that win not isaac brizuela player who 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.439
 dominates the league by its arrival by 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.150
 bands and middle distance stuck the 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.099
 responsibility for this when entering the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.099
 Playground simply enjoy 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.030
 how are they doing it and can you play with 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.939
 that freedom 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.129
 oribe peralta forcefulness and goals the 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.189
 most forceful attacker in the league 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.439
 aztec raul jimenez his chilean has us 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.340
 in the world cup good technique and 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:43.330
 great definition I declare you 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.599
 I have to know how to take advantage of javier 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.970
 hernández delivers work and statistics 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.410
 forceful your enemy the little 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.690
 participation in your club to 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.069
 thank you for your words more than anything 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.870
 he publicly recognizes that 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.220
 true he does not have the need as 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.150
 As a coach , I thank you 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.580
 really because he is the first coach 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.709
 that publicly speaks a little bit of what 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.220
 that I have done alan polished lived great 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.470
 moment 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.180
 now he has continued on his team and 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.430
 enjoys great definition 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.870
 obviously excites me motivates me to be able 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.440
 be re sharing together with 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.500
 them and it still makes me work even more to 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.139
 these are missing four more players 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.750
 seven that Miguel has the first doubt is 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.510
 in the goal for third place 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.940
 for guillermo ochoa or moisés muñoz el 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.190
 second meets Miguel and the first 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.340
 shines in the French league the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.840
 commitments simply if I know them 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.430
 I know how much to tighten but they 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.620
 they also know that there is a competition 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.600
 loyal and that I am very cool I try to be what 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.789
 fair as possible to all 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.169
 players and I have a fair competition 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.120
 if someone drops game 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.680
 or really when I bring them each 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.169
 they show us the ability to good 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.870
 speakers with the possibility that others 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.069
 super and innovation Juan Carlos 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.509
 Valenzuela Enrique Perez and Miguel Ponce 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.849
 determinant players in the scheme 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.759
 but they are good changes for the area 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.909
 defensive and I can be the people of 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.039
 those seven players or 654 that I took 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.169
 with me in two years they were better team 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.729
 from mexico or not from a better team 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.699
 that america up 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.979
 giovanni dos saints and marked fabian the 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.319
 first he goes through an injury and that has 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.479
 slowed his great step in Spain marked 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.669
 live a great moment in the league although 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.639
 does not find comfortable in the scheme 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.580
 Miguel thought that he already had 22 23 more or 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.370
 fewer seconds I'm only 28 and I have to 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.379
 will eliminate 5 and good post although be 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.569
 fair and those who improve within the 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.580
 be empty and when only missing 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.099
 adjust the last pieces to travel to 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.259
 Brazil the list will be announced on 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.610
 next May 9th through the 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.159
 Mexican soccer federation 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.380
 important that day 22 2003 May 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.930
 be they understand the players of the 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.150
 3 that we want are those that travel the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.000
 farewell party play reiterate 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.300
 if they do not want and if God wants and 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.789
 nothing is happening then obviously 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.740
 those will be those who finish playing the 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.690
 party farewell in the past 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.150
 parties let's go down to Brazil and play the 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.560
 world since there is the advance that 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.169
 he gives them the last word of the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.539
 summoned by Miguel Herrera to the cup 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.040
 of the world of brasil 2014 what do you think 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.300
 Sirs 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.639
 and I think that the closest thing to what 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.229
 we think also by 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.059
 what Miguel said and for the job 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.059
 that he brings with all these players and 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.849
 so he touched him mostly as how 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.759
 grab mexico in that match against 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.739
 new zealand we already know the history 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.659
 I think it has logic too 

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:42.949
 then wait for a surprise of what 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.739
 We are seeing I did not expect it 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.139
 either but if there are two issues here one 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:50.689
 is that when this situation started he 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.789
 makes landa and such and more or less 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.899
 I was trying to make a sketch of what 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.199
 was going to be the selection in the world 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:07:00.799
 2014 or the initial table the 23 if they have 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:02.479
 there were surprises so that we are clear 

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:04.639
 which is that when we say we are missing a lot 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.759
 the time of the gallito vázquez until the 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.679
 doubts is one of the doubts forget the 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.179
 third goalkeeper and I am surprised by the 

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.430
 that is a doubt for example I two 

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:19.490
 Saints personally 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:21.530
 but also for miguel then this 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.540
 it's the second thing and although they get on 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.020
 ship others who remain here in need 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.020
 it would be the question
