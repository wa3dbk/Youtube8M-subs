00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 looks played my way 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.590
 lux basically needs a lot of mana 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.310
 oberta skill 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.730
 and magic penetration 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:20.480
 zhouqu is not as useful as he believes in and 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.890
 is the true power mixed with the w 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.890
 to resist 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:33.480
 the is the power that will make you dominate mid 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.530
 being easy to shoot causing damage 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.530
 the enemy in area 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.109
 initial objects much regeneration of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.149
 mana to last much longer than the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.700
 enemy making your level more 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.540
 high and your damage is greater 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.030
 that's the end is the final build can 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.130
 be modified to taste until the third 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.880
 item as I said earlier 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:04.809
 great seal of regeneration of mana 9 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:09.909
 great brand of magic penetration 9 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:13.229
 grant hill was of skill 9 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.000
 great quintessence of skill power 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.370
 3 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.130
 the expertise are designed for ability 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.490
 power magic penetration and regeneration 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.490
 of mana 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.590
 you must maximize first see 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 then q 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.170
 yr 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.030
 next I will show how to 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 combat that you should have in mid 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.580
 you can drag it with anyone 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.530
 they just can not do you much 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.770
 damage more than in the first part of the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 game 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.560
 always trying to shoot the place 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.090
 where you think you are going to move 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.500
 you necessarily have to throw him 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.740
 you just have to shoot 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.080
 I do not recommend using the q as much as 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.250
 that can put you in danger when aig 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.259
 to a tumblr nearby 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.769
 ward 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.930
 the reason why I bring a guard is 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.269
 because I always want to have a side like 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.780
 I'm in right now I'm the ones from 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.540
 up I put the guard down because if 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.620
 I have more vision and they will not beat me 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.620
 less easily 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.610
 the brutal combo 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.050
 what it does is so effective the power of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 light is not your instant power almost like 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.840
 scam what he did to me in an instant is his 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.770
 long- term power you're simply 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.170
 wearing it until you have the possibility 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.390
 to give you with your air 'catching it with you 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.330
 cv if you can 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.830
 just the call down of the wing allows you 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.830
 shoot quickly 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.720
 I recommend the button configuration 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.030
 motion prediction too 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.030
 will show the range of each spell 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.459
 you have to configure the buttons 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.310
 how is a screen 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.709
 It's just a matter of what you 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.050
 you are accustomed and you will have much more 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.900
 chances of winning since you can 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.880
 costing the spells much faster and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.060
 that way you can destroy your 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.060
 enemy 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.090
 20 mind for a photo with some 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.040
 20 doing an action works not me 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.370
 import 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.910
 already already the demon had to kill 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.910
 do not 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.390
 no no 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.180
 looked like 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.300
 do not 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.849
 d
