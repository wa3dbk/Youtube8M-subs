00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.440
 so you can safely start with lightroom now 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.270
 it can be useful to start 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.190
 before again the default settings 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.680
 Checked through and here you can over 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.950
 edit in the preferences go 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.930
 control or command as a shortcut below 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.320
 the mac operating system can be found in the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.730
 lightroom menu under preferences 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.070
 i open the presets now and 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.560
 I'm in the general point here you can the 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.099
 language select the line started 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.390
 shall be 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.450
 you can now different 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.400
 select settings to start and that 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.469
 whether the opening screen so the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.050
 logo of lightroom should be displayed 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.710
 and whether ladder automatically after update 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.420
 should seek 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.000
 these attitudes are already so 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 optimally chosen the standard catalog 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.230
 So here you can set which 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.829
 catalog open at program start 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.840
 shall be 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.399
 By default, yes is set last 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.109
 load opened catalog 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.660
 but I can also say that lightroom 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.550
 every time I start asking questions 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.679
 which catalog should be opened 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.150
 I personally have this attitude 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.490
 actually always missing because I'm with 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.020
 a big catalog worker and there 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.840
 Of course I want this catalog 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.119
 always open an import 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.189
 Options, I can now say whether line 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.909
 now automatically the import dialog 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.159
 should show 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.860
 if you have recognized a memory card 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.140
 This option is new and can be 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.750
 I say collection current previous 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.280
 import on import select that 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.930
 is the following now when I am now 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.000
 example in this folder inside bin 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.890
 and from a memory card pictures 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.390
 import then lightroom jumps 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.549
 while the import is done 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.979
 automatically in the previous import 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.259
 if that bothers me then you can go with it 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.090
 this checkbox will change this behavior 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.799
 and lightroom stays in the current one 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.659
 folder in which I am currently working 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.759
 For me personally , that's a lot 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.500
 nice update the option is namely 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.899
 only five came with lightroom 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.149
 the nice thing is that I'm in 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.130
 my workflow it in my work 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.219
 not interrupted here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.719
 when naming folders from the 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.850
 Camera generates the folder name 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.890
 Ignore it when I'm in the camera 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.259
 folder created when photographing 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.870
 Can I use this option with these folders 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.580
 just ignore it in import and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.800
 if I am with jake data now and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.960
 photograph raw data simultaneously 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.430
 I now choose that this data from 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.890
 suffering 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.780
 to be treated as separate photos 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.819
 then both data really become 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.049
 I personally imported them 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.299
 but recommend that you only use the 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.459
 Raw data works and this setting 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.340
 here deselected so that one at 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.560
 work for example an acoustic 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.019
 I can say at ton 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.879
 a photo import or play 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.639
 after the photo in port I can hear a sound 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.769
 let play say after the 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.019
 Play a therapy transfer 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.639
 So if I have the camera right now 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.349
 I have connected with management 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.000
 Okay now I want a tone 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.709
 if that is now on mine 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.470
 catalog has been imported 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.209
 or if I export several pictures 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 Of course, we need one for you 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.840
 some time so I know when 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.950
 I can finish export here 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.319
 sound play 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.969
 it also has various input on 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.980
 demands were different 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.780
 fields dialog fields and I can 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.950
 away clicks say we show these 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.750
 Fields were no longer on 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.189
 but now I have all the warnings 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.980
 I want to see you again here 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.689
 click on it will be all dialogues 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.579
 reset fields and I get 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.799
 now again all dialog pictures 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.359
 displayed and the last point is 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.489
 just a point that I get from the 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.690
 Preferences directly in the catalog 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.519
 Settings can jump 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.949
 so yes these are the presets 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.949
 to lead the field in general
