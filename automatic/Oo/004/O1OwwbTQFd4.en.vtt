try to toss the ball right up against

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.970 
try to toss the ball right up against
the<00:05:06.450> fence<00:05:06.690> have<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.020> land<00:05:07.260> on<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> fence<00:05:07.770> and

the fence have it land on the fence and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.730 
the fence have it land on the fence and
kind<00:05:08.130> of<00:05:08.190> trickle<00:05:08.580> back<00:05:08.730> down<00:05:09.080> yes<00:05:10.080> and<00:05:10.470> now

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
kind of trickle back down yes and now

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
kind of trickle back down yes and now
give<00:05:10.980> me<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.160> full<00:05:11.460> almost<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.180> full<00:05:12.390> service<00:05:13.760> yes

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
give me a full almost a full service yes

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.909 
give me a full almost a full service yes
let's<00:05:15.570> see<00:05:15.720> if<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.900> can<00:05:16.050> get<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.380> glide<00:05:16.680> up

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
let's see if you can get it to glide up

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.620 
let's see if you can get it to glide up
the<00:05:17.160> fence<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.700> back<00:05:17.940> down<00:05:19.940> better

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
the fence and back down better

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.860 
the fence and back down better
now<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.320> trick<00:05:23.680> here<00:05:23.710> is<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.550> not<00:05:24.880> have<00:05:25.600> to

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
now the trick here is to not have to

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.830 
now the trick here is to not have to
move<00:05:26.110> your<00:05:26.320> body<00:05:26.500> at<00:05:26.830> all<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.820> catch<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.300> again

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
move your body at all to catch it again

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.260 
move your body at all to catch it again
it<00:05:29.170> should<00:05:29.350> be<00:05:29.500> in<00:05:29.590> such<00:05:29.950> accuracy<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:31.150> it

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
it should be in such accuracy that it

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.840 
it should be in such accuracy that it
comes<00:05:31.480> right<00:05:31.870> back<00:05:32.140> into<00:05:32.590> your<00:05:32.680> head<00:05:32.920> this<00:05:33.670> is

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
comes right back into your head this is

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.490 
comes right back into your head this is
kind<00:05:34.060> of<00:05:34.150> again<00:05:34.420> like<00:05:34.660> that<00:05:34.690> Christmas<00:05:35.470> tree

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
kind of again like that Christmas tree

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.010 
kind of again like that Christmas tree
you<00:05:35.800> know<00:05:35.920> placing<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.790> ornament<00:05:37.330> on<00:05:37.480> the

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
you know placing the ornament on the

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.860 
you know placing the ornament on the
Christmas<00:05:38.470> tree<00:05:38.640> this<00:05:39.640> will<00:05:39.850> on<00:05:40.060> this<00:05:40.420> alone

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
Christmas tree this will on this alone

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.750 
Christmas tree this will on this alone
just<00:05:41.290> doing<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:41.620> exercise<00:05:42.160> will<00:05:42.640> improve

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
just doing this exercise will improve

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.300 
just doing this exercise will improve
your<00:05:43.180> toss<00:05:43.420> accuracy<00:05:44.230> tremendously<00:05:45.040> because

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
your toss accuracy tremendously because

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950 
your toss accuracy tremendously because
it<00:05:45.580> restricts<00:05:46.060> your<00:05:46.150> motion<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:46.840> your

movement in your head which oftentimes

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.200 
movement in your head which oftentimes
is<00:05:49.840> what<00:05:50.080> leads<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.440> a<00:05:50.530> bad<00:05:50.800> talk<00:05:51.100> give<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.180> a

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
is what leads to a bad talk give you a

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
couple more try to really get it to

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.950 
couple more try to really get it to
graze<00:05:56.050> against<00:05:56.590> that<00:05:56.740> fence<00:05:57.300> yes<00:05:58.300> do<00:05:58.870> your
