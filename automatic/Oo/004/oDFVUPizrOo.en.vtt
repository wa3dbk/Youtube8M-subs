00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
let's get started so we're going to be

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.150 
let's get started so we're going to be
starting<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> axial<00:00:31.740> park<00:00:31.949> north

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
starting here at the axial park north

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
starting here at the axial park north
crammed<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> axial<00:00:33.360> products

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
crammed with in the axial products

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.290 
crammed with in the axial products
section<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.460> Karelia<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.059> we're<00:00:36.180> starting

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
section of Karelia so we're starting

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.180 
section of Karelia so we're starting
here<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> world<00:00:36.870> map<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.890> we're<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
here in the world map so we're going to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
here in the world map so we're going to
cut<00:00:38.340> across<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.760> park<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.629> we're

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cut across the park here and then we're

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.000 
cut across the park here and then we're
going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> cut<00:00:40.200> through<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.469> set<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> tunnels

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
going to cut through this set of tunnels

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to cut through this set of tunnels
below<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.850> Republic<00:00:42.300> safe<00:00:42.480> house<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.960> then

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
below the Republic safe house and then

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.799 
below the Republic safe house and then
down<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.340> through<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.300> set<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.629> tunnels

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
down here through this set of tunnels

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
down here through this set of tunnels
into<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> Coronet<00:00:46.710> zoo<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.700> from<00:00:47.789> there

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
into the Coronet zoo and then from there

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.889 
into the Coronet zoo and then from there
we're<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> add<00:00:48.360> south<00:00:48.570> through<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
we're going to add south through the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
we're going to add south through the
final<00:00:49.289> set<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> tunnels<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.090> that'll<00:00:51.090> take<00:00:51.270> us

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
final set of tunnels and that'll take us

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.760 
final set of tunnels and that'll take us
down<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.960> section<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.500> we'll<00:00:52.649> be

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
down into this section and we'll be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.279 
down into this section and we'll be
heading<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.370> museum<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.050> there

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
heading into this museum and from there

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.750 
heading into this museum and from there
is<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.829> start<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.190> actual<00:00:56.430> fun<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
is when we start the actual fun of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
is when we start the actual fun of
getting<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> data<00:00:57.300> conn<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.410> let's<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.859> ahead

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
getting the data conn so let's go ahead

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
getting the data conn so let's go ahead
and<00:00:59.039> head<00:00:59.190> out

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.440 

so<00:01:09.310> once<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.549> come<00:01:09.700> out<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:09.970> park<00:01:10.180> your<00:01:10.330> is

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
so once you come out of the park your is

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.550 
so once you come out of the park your is
going<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.720> left<00:01:10.930> onto<00:01:11.140> this<00:01:11.290> path<00:01:11.500> and

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
going to have left onto this path and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.050 
going to have left onto this path and
then<00:01:11.830> make<00:01:12.009> an<00:01:12.130> immediate<00:01:12.310> right<00:01:12.520> into<00:01:12.940> the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
then make an immediate right into the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.170 
then make an immediate right into the
set<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.360> tunnels

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.130 

okay<00:01:23.180> now<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.390> we're<00:01:23.600> out<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.870> first

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
okay now that we're out of the first

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.300 
okay now that we're out of the first
that<00:01:24.320> are<00:01:24.410> tunnels<00:01:24.710> we're<00:01:24.860> just<00:01:24.980> going<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.190> go

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
that are tunnels we're just going to go

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.770 
that are tunnels we're just going to go
straight<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.760> then<00:01:25.820> head<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> right<00:01:26.480> onto

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
straight and then head to the right onto

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.210 
straight and then head to the right onto
this<00:01:26.900> curved<00:01:27.200> path<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.710> then<00:01:27.800> make<00:01:27.980> another

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this curved path and then make another

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620 
this curved path and then make another
right<00:01:28.490> down<00:01:28.730> into<00:01:28.940> this<00:01:29.150> set<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.510> tunnels

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
right down into this set of tunnels

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
right down into this set of tunnels
toward<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.050> cornet<00:01:30.410> zoo

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.590 

and<00:01:42.340> now<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.729> we're<00:01:42.880> out<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.299> set<00:01:43.509> of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
and now that we're out of that set of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 
and now that we're out of that set of
tunnels<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:44.350> can<00:01:44.439> go<00:01:44.560> either<00:01:44.740> way<00:01:44.890> on<00:01:45.100> around

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
tunnels you can go either way on around

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.120 
tunnels you can go either way on around
this<00:01:45.969> path<00:01:46.210> doesn't<00:01:46.539> matter<00:01:46.780> but<00:01:47.710> essentially

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
this path doesn't matter but essentially

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.559 
this path doesn't matter but essentially
we're<00:01:48.219> going<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.399> end<00:01:48.549> up<00:01:48.670> here<00:01:49.210> at<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
we're going to end up here at the

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.109 
we're going to end up here at the
southern<00:01:50.259> exit<00:01:50.469> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.039> Coronet<00:01:51.340> zoo<00:01:51.549> and

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
southern exit to the Coronet zoo and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.249 
southern exit to the Coronet zoo and
we're<00:01:52.299> going<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.450> travel<00:01:52.630> through<00:01:52.899> those<00:01:53.079> set

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
we're going to travel through those set

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:08.650 
we're going to travel through those set
of<00:01:53.350> tunnels

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.750 

and<00:02:09.660> while<00:02:10.259> you're<00:02:10.290> in<00:02:10.530> these<00:02:10.710> tunnels<00:02:10.950> there

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and while you're in these tunnels there

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760 
and while you're in these tunnels there
is<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:12.480> over<00:02:12.600> here<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> red<00:02:13.170> crystal<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is right over here a red crystal and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
is right over here a red crystal and
it's<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> plus-10<00:02:14.700> datacron<00:02:15.270> on<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
it's for a plus-10 datacron on the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's for a plus-10 datacron on the
Republic<00:02:16.980> fleet<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.520> also<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
Republic fleet it's also for the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.730 
Republic fleet it's also for the
Imperial<00:02:18.450> fleet<00:02:18.480> too<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:19.620> you're

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
Imperial fleet too so if you're

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.140 
Imperial fleet too so if you're
interested<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.460> ahead<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:20.880> check

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
interested in that go ahead and go check

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.190 
interested in that go ahead and go check
out<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.920> datacron<00:02:22.920> +<00:02:23.490> 10<00:02:23.760> stall<00:02:24.120> stats<00:02:24.390> video

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
out the datacron + 10 stall stats video

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.110 
out the datacron + 10 stall stats video
and<00:02:25.680> I'll<00:02:25.980> show<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.160> exactly<00:02:26.430> where<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.940> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and I'll show you exactly where that is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.630 
and I'll show you exactly where that is
but<00:02:27.530> now<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.560> we're<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.280> tunnels

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
but now that we're out of that tunnels

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.400 
but now that we're out of that tunnels
we're<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> head<00:02:30.810> down<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:31.320> to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
we're just going to head down here to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.410 
we're just going to head down here to
this<00:02:31.530> path<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.040> make<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> right<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.240> head

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this path and make a right and then head

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:45.300 
this path and make a right and then head
towards<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:33.990> museum<00:02:34.500> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.410 

okay<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.370> now<00:02:46.609> we're<00:02:46.760> right<00:02:46.939> in<00:02:47.060> front<00:02:47.269> it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
okay so now we're right in front it

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.640 
okay so now we're right in front it
right<00:02:47.599> here<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.870> front<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.170> museum<00:02:48.260> we're

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
right here in front of the museum we're

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.050 
right here in front of the museum we're
just<00:02:48.799> going<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.010> head<00:02:49.159> in<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.700> head<00:02:49.879> to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
just going to head in and the head to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.149 
just going to head in and the head to
the<00:02:50.150> right<00:02:50.329> and<00:02:50.540> there<00:02:50.629> will<00:02:50.719> be<00:02:50.840> an<00:02:50.930> elevator

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.520 

okay<00:02:58.159> so<00:02:58.310> once<00:02:59.120> you're<00:02:59.299> inside<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.349> where

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
okay so once you're inside this is where

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.990 
okay so once you're inside this is where
the<00:03:00.620> elevators<00:03:01.069> we<00:03:01.250> came<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.609> here<00:03:01.639> and<00:03:01.879> just

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the elevators we came in here and just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.879 
the elevators we came in here and just
made<00:03:02.239> an<00:03:02.329> immediate<00:03:02.510> right<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.739> we're

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
made an immediate right and so we're

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:04.959 
made an immediate right and so we're
just<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.219> to<00:03:04.250> head<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.730> rooftop

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
just going to head up to the rooftop

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.640 
just going to head up to the rooftop
shuttle<00:03:05.510> pad<00:03:07.840> okay<00:03:08.840> now<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.079> you're<00:03:09.319> on<00:03:09.379> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
shuttle pad okay now that you're on the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.259 
shuttle pad okay now that you're on the
rooftop<00:03:10.310> shuttlepod<00:03:10.760> you're<00:03:10.909> just<00:03:11.060> going<00:03:11.209> to

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
rooftop shuttlepod you're just going to

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.990 
rooftop shuttlepod you're just going to
go<00:03:11.359> ahead<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.599> jump<00:03:11.840> up<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:13.000> basically

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
go ahead and jump up and basically

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.809 
go ahead and jump up and basically
follow<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:14.629> little<00:03:15.439> shuttlecraft<00:03:16.219> up<00:03:16.519> and

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
follow this little shuttlecraft up and

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.720 
follow this little shuttlecraft up and
go<00:03:17.810> up<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.079> wing<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.709> jump<00:03:19.069> off<00:03:19.220> onto<00:03:19.459> this

go up the wing and jump off onto this
rooftop<00:03:19.970> here<00:03:20.419> and<00:03:21.019> then<00:03:21.349> you're<00:03:21.439> just<00:03:21.500> going

going to jump off onto this lower

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.770 
going to jump off onto this lower
rooftop<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:27.970> here<00:03:28.970> we<00:03:29.090> are<00:03:29.180> in<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.299> map<00:03:29.540> we're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
rooftop so here we are in the map we're

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.509 
rooftop so here we are in the map we're
just<00:03:30.169> above<00:03:30.439> the<00:03:30.500> museum<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.219> we're<00:03:31.340> going<00:03:31.459> to

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
just above the museum so we're going to

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.159 
just above the museum so we're going to
jump<00:03:31.760> onto<00:03:31.939> the<00:03:32.090> lower<00:03:32.329> roof<00:03:32.599> top<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.049> the

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
jump onto the lower roof top of the

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.990 
jump onto the lower roof top of the
museum<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.739> here<00:03:37.099> you<00:03:37.159> can<00:03:37.280> mount<00:03:37.489> up<00:03:37.760> and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
museum and here you can mount up and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.479 
museum and here you can mount up and
just<00:03:38.989> make<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:39.379> way<00:03:39.530> around<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.189> roof<00:03:42.489> okay

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
just make your way around the roof okay

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.610 
just make your way around the roof okay
now<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.730> you're<00:03:44.090> at<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.540> far<00:03:45.019> corner<00:03:45.409> of<00:03:45.439> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
now that you're at the far corner of the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.229 
now that you're at the far corner of the
roof<00:03:45.919> so<00:03:46.250> now<00:03:46.370> we're<00:03:46.519> on<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.700> opposite<00:03:47.060> side

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
roof so now we're on the opposite side

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.360 
roof so now we're on the opposite side
of<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.389> top<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.719> the<00:03:47.780> museum<00:03:48.169> I'm<00:03:49.099> going<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.310> go

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
of the top of the museum I'm going to go

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.710 
of the top of the museum I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.549> dismount<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.180> then<00:03:50.389> you'll<00:03:50.510> see

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
ahead and dismount and then you'll see

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.420 
ahead and dismount and then you'll see
the<00:03:50.750> magnetic<00:03:51.319> stabilizer<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:51.919> so<00:03:52.159> this<00:03:52.310> is

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the magnetic stabilizer and so this is

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.210 
the magnetic stabilizer and so this is
where<00:03:52.579> your<00:03:52.729> mtgs<00:03:53.299> comes<00:03:53.690> into<00:03:53.930> play<00:03:54.220> so

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
where your mtgs comes into play so

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.860 
where your mtgs comes into play so
you're<00:03:55.370> going<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.669> go<00:03:55.940> ahead<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.209> spam<00:03:56.569> right

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
you're going to go ahead and spam right

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
have to re-record this path multiple

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.810 
have to re-record this path multiple
times<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.830> we're<00:04:53.950> going<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.130> be<00:04:54.220> starting<00:04:54.550> here

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
times so we're going to be starting here

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.600 
times so we're going to be starting here
at<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.120> word<00:04:55.360> post<00:04:55.660> lords<00:04:56.140> in<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.830> king's<00:04:57.370> pass

at the word post lords in a king's pass

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.670 
at the word post lords in a king's pass
section<00:04:58.060> of<00:04:58.240> Alderaan<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:59.290> we're<00:04:59.470> right<00:04:59.650> here

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
section of Alderaan so we're right here

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.280 
section of Alderaan so we're right here
and<00:05:00.100> we're<00:05:00.340> going<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.520> follow<00:05:00.670> this<00:05:00.940> path<00:05:01.290> up

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
and we're going to follow this path up

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.710 
and we're going to follow this path up
just<00:05:03.190> basically<00:05:03.730> straight<00:05:04.060> up<00:05:04.210> is<00:05:04.420> sticking

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
just basically straight up is sticking

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.420 
just basically straight up is sticking
to<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> left<00:05:05.140> so<00:05:05.320> all<00:05:05.740> these<00:05:05.860> offshoots<00:05:06.310> we're

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
to the left so all these offshoots we're

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.520 
to the left so all these offshoots we're
going<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.610> ignore<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.870> we're<00:05:08.020> going<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.200> travel

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
going to ignore so we're going to travel

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.470 
going to ignore so we're going to travel
on<00:05:08.710> this<00:05:08.890> path<00:05:09.070> here<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.610> it's<00:05:10.090> going<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.300> go

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
on this path here and it's going to go

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.180 
on this path here and it's going to go
up<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.900> actually<00:05:11.020> into<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.710> other<00:05:11.860> zone

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
up and actually into the other zone

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.280 
up and actually into the other zone
right<00:05:12.400> next<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.790> us<00:05:12.820> but<00:05:13.750> you'll<00:05:13.930> stay<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:14.200> the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
right next to us but you'll stay on the

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.050 
right next to us but you'll stay on the
path<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.590> it's<00:05:14.920> basically<00:05:15.130> right<00:05:15.550> off<00:05:15.730> of<00:05:15.760> the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
path and it's basically right off of the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:29.409 
path and it's basically right off of the
map<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:17.290> let's<00:05:17.530> head<00:05:17.650> up

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.209 

okay<00:05:30.419> so<00:05:30.479> now<00:05:30.719> we<00:05:30.780> come<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.080> our<00:05:31.229> first<00:05:31.500> split

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
okay so now we come to our first split

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.800 
okay so now we come to our first split
in<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.490> path<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:32.909> we're<00:05:33.060> going<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.270> just<00:05:33.449> stick

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
in the path so we're going to just stick

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.260 
in the path so we're going to just stick
to<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.020> left<00:05:34.319> the<00:05:35.099> whole<00:05:35.280> time<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:35.789> you<00:05:35.849> left

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
to the left the whole time so you left

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.490 
to the left the whole time so you left
and<00:05:36.479> you're<00:05:36.569> just<00:05:36.719> going<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.930> ignore<00:05:37.020> all<00:05:37.319> this

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
and you're just going to ignore all this

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.529 
and you're just going to ignore all this
side<00:05:37.710> path<00:05:37.949> and<00:05:38.250> stay<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.669> left<00:05:38.819> so<00:05:39.419> you'll

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
side path and stay to the left so you'll

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:46.129 
side path and stay to the left so you'll
just<00:05:39.629> turn<00:05:39.810> left<00:05:39.990> here<00:05:44.599> okay<00:05:45.599> once<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:45.930> get<00:05:46.110> to

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
just turn left here okay once you get to

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.420 
just turn left here okay once you get to
this<00:05:46.349> split<00:05:46.650> you're<00:05:46.830> still<00:05:47.069> going<00:05:47.189> to<00:05:47.219> stay<00:05:47.370> to

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
this split you're still going to stay to

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.830 
this split you're still going to stay to
the<00:05:47.639> left<00:05:47.759> but<00:05:47.969> this<00:05:48.120> one's<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.360> little<00:05:48.479> strange

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
the left but this one's a little strange

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.420 
the left but this one's a little strange
because<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.289> sort<00:05:49.469> of<00:05:49.530> looks<00:05:49.770> like<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:49.979> path

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
because it sort of looks like this path

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.129 
because it sort of looks like this path
