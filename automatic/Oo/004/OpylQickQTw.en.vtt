00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.969
 we see the difficulty of assessing the hardest it is expected 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.249
 the focus and then the the same meaning 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.289
 blu-ray cutting head 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.509

 sometimes it's our goal 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.360
 they point out that they believed 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.689
 so when the team 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.689

 for the purists difficulty stop it 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.580
 the conflict and more I had 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.300
