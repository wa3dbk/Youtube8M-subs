00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.030
 so far the only winner in a 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.830
 housing project of the municipality of 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.839
 Purification in Tolima is the candidate 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.570
 who lost the election to the 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.309
 current mayor this was the owner of a 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.589
 property that days before the sale was worth 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.490
 65 million pesos and by which 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.500
 they paid 800 million that such this before 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.240
 of the holy week a councilor of 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.670
 purification called the mayor so that 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.220
 will explain why he bought in 800 million 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.430
 of pesos a property that before the business 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.710
 it was worth 64 million and whose owner 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.870
 I was coming out of a defeat the lord 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.970
 but alexander was the owner of 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.500
 this estate that is more was former candidate 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.120
 to the municipal council of purification 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.640
 few months after his defeat 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.260
 policy the winner began to move a 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.150
 project that triggered the price of their 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.370
 properties in the plan 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.290
 territorial ordering changed from 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.210
 rural to urbanizable 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.790
 precisely that sector has taken a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.190
 great boom and because of this situation by 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.170
 the proximity of the main road as 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.390
 this has not increased according to the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 councilman although he has changed the norm 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.710
 urban requires a risky investment 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.680
 because it does not comply with the national standard 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.020
 of protest 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.580
 of the bodies of water do not cross the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.460
 sewage from the front of this 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.290
 estate of light on light poles 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.140
 they were distant to protect with the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.570
 Front of the lot is included for sap 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.650
 a few meters from a broken the case 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.110
 is already in the hands of the comptroller 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.360
 department that in addition to the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.670
 ground conditions examines the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.650
 multiplication of its price that according to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.940
 study that a company from bogota did 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.680
 it has its logic 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.080
 one says not here the norm is said 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.020
 multifamily I focus on that 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.850
 because there is an article has a paragraph 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.160
 in which he says he should focus 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.380
 towards the maximum that can explode in the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.090
 property so do not do it is to say yes 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.950
 as the councilor believes the property does not 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.330
 is suitable for housing plans 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.520
 of social interest that promotes the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.470
 national government cordon de miseria las 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.960
 developments in high-risk areas 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.090
 the only beneficiary with the plan 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 housing of the new government will be the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.320
 candidate who was defeated in the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.729
 past elections the ministry of 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.680
 housing has said that it examines every 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.780
 project to avoid stagnation by 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.140
 lack of requirements as in the government 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.140
