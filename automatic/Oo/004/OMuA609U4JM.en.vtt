00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 cartesian cliff now in upper respavnu 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.859
 tornado and now the same situation 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.510
 where the team has every chance to win 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.730
 setups mirror 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.530
 and that means the arcade team can 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.450
 look only at some comfortable 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.930
 respawn for yourself and uncomfortable for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.760
 opponent as it happens, in principle, 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.020
 very rarely beer so coincides that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.519
 one of the teams top to another is not comfortable 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 well let's see what of this 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.590
 it turns out all the same except 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.260
 bass we have spawn technology 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
 and so many people constantly talk about 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.620
 This is that sometimes full of a lot 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.989
 decides and you have to play bora spa 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 despite the whole stage we are listening to the commander 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.920
 let's go put a plus and start 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.920
 listen to the tornado to listen and curse 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.280
 not a plan 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.219
 tearful slaver oh well plus morals 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 before that, too, pull up when the fake 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:20.940
 you can still throw 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.890
 sell did not sell gender this site 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.000
 see complete horses get ready 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.760
 nuts and three bottom 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 and he already 6 2 poonazhay would be equal to yours 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.200
 on the show while streaming someone down here 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.410
 and do not celebrate both three hours three 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.690
 benefits minus 2 minus 3 capes and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.690
 what tags come on come on let's come again 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:55.850

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.979
 update this niche 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.049
 fall out ready principle for us it is necessary 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.390
 so here this whole life from to required 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.799
 on the sly 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.250
 which all fall out replace 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.250
 front 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.290
 define fraxinus and focus determine 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.760
 through the center of the clean lake who will a 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.530
 may have moved we need 20 on 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.799

 voice do we have left to hide 4 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:38.930
 Sokash supervised besides throwing stones 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:41.090
 there is a collar gerald but nickname -3 which 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.489
 to fist 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:58.069
 crowns on different shoots will take 131 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:03:00.830
 pick up xml there is the end of the wire drima necessary 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.150
 go out on the idea yes nato locks you 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.590
 want to collect and marveled all behind 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:12.349
 will go down either can duration but did not want 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.670
 will rest the rest of the dublin 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.569
 try to keep it up the rest can 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.160
 nuclear level 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:24.829
 anger when i'm who's infected i'm dressed up 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.750
 country code fish, we sit up to 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:39.970
 middle back looked worth just 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:39.970
 turn not only that is 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.780
 need alexey up focus magic 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.840
 would show a hocus pocus would ruin two 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.630
 tank and it would be another victory that's all 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.400
 toronto well there start the battle gave damage 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.860
 and it didnâ€™t go too far 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.320
 damage for soaked so much 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.209
 did not suffice themselves then neighing the plan 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.430
 yes there are cases and tricks decide everything 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.260
 leave reality for everyone not 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.580
 I personally know your goal here is 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.360
 even go in so that everyone has their own 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.489
 the goal is not always possible for children 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.530
 much pvp turned out yes it's 20 for 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.690
 arcade almost early victory 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.730
 3 point match will be to complete this 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.590
 meeting will be very hard again 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.650
 guys from tornado to save this 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.210
 the match will probably listen further already and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.750
 team arcade 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.030
 ruinberg map is very complicated map and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.710
 find out how difficult this card is 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.900
 well go to the arcade as far as 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.750
 everything will be easy or problems will begin 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.770
 and this will be the beginning of comeback for tornado 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.770
 maybe well there
