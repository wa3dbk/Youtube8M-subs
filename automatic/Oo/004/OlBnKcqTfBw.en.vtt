00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.390
 my hands forgive me the noises 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 because miguel is playing with 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 his little friends then that madness in the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.679
 child should already have an idea 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.599
 anyway it's my mother, this one's broke 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.640
 It's been about two months now and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.180
 Since then I have been using a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 keep her in the corner to stay 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.210
 gaining in nothing and I do not need 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.609
 let him cut 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 so I'll show you guys today 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 I should have made this video before 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.910
 had never touched me and now I'm 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 doing I went out to do this step and I just 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 I will not get the camera record to the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 girls I think they should 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:47.960
 take advantage of sometime in her life 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.960
 well I do not like it, I do not like it, I took it. 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:59.449
 this b stop that comes to winning now 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.449
 it's without enamel coming down to you 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.369
 doing all I'll get a 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.950
 pen is the one I use to push the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.990
 cuticle I think it is less aggressive 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.970
 so you do not run the risk of cutting yourself 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 or anything so I push the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:28.790
 cuticle washcloth and I'm going to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.790
 base you may be using either a 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 any zone or even a base with a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 kiss and coldplay there you choose and I go 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:51.750
 to get over a certain I'll get a 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:57.450
 small piece of toilet paper 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.600
 He has some balls to tighten so that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.590
 he is very lively and I do not have 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.879
 problem in applying it in the same 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:12.250
 and I will apply in the itÃ¡qui area. 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.530
 is broken in case it is well that on the bridge 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.739
 so I do not need so much product and I'm going 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.739
 tighten here to stick up on base 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.420
 I'll wait to dry a little and then 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.640

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:52.079
