toast but I wouldn't swap this for a
Bugatti<00:02:20.769> Veyron<00:02:21.010> that's<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.519> sure<00:02:21.930> probably

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
Bugatti Veyron that's for sure probably

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.570 
Bugatti Veyron that's for sure probably
because<00:02:23.319> he<00:02:23.410> couldn't<00:02:23.680> do<00:02:23.860> this

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390 

so<00:02:32.580> what<00:02:32.700> makes<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.180> fast<00:02:34.130> well<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
so what makes it so fast well a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.190 
so what makes it so fast well a
beautifully<00:02:36.120> crafted<00:02:36.330> engine<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.020> two

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
beautifully crafted engine with two

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.950 
beautifully crafted engine with two
enormous<00:02:37.560> turbo<00:02:38.280> certainly<00:02:38.790> helped<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.810> this

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
enormous turbo certainly helped but this

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.570 
enormous turbo certainly helped but this
isn't<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.290> lots<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.770> fast<00:02:41.040> bits<00:02:41.280> lung

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
isn't just lots of fast bits lung

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.730 
isn't just lots of fast bits lung
together<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.270> nine<00:02:42.690> point<00:02:43.020> three<00:02:43.110> liters<00:02:43.710> of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
together it's nine point three liters of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.250 
together it's nine point three liters of
perfectly<00:02:44.370> tuned<00:02:44.700> v8<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.690> millimeter<00:02:45.930> of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
perfectly tuned v8 just a millimeter of

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.690 
perfectly tuned v8 just a millimeter of
throttle<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:46.770> enough<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.100> break<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.310> speed

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
throttle is enough to break the speed

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.340 
throttle is enough to break the speed
limit<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.390> probably<00:02:48.600> find<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.050> not<00:02:49.230> that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
limit you probably find it's not that

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.490 
limit you probably find it's not that
