still quite a lot to me but metagross

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.559 
still quite a lot to me but metagross
can<00:03:22.590> keep<00:03:22.799> taking<00:03:23.190> these<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.609> while<00:03:23.669> so<00:03:24.359> I

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
can keep taking these for a while so I

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.770 
can keep taking these for a while so I
go<00:03:25.349> for<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> mush<00:03:26.250> again<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.150> does<00:03:27.359> hit<00:03:27.599> this

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
go for a mush again and it does hit this

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.500 
go for a mush again and it does hit this
time<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:29.040> takes<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.370> pouring<00:03:29.609> on<00:03:29.699> due<00:03:29.879> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
time and it takes the pouring on due to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.479 
time and it takes the pouring on due to
just<00:03:31.049> over<00:03:31.260> half<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.040> I'm<00:03:32.099> thinking<00:03:32.310> this

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
just over half and I'm thinking this

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.099 
just over half and I'm thinking this
thing's<00:03:32.729> really<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.419> defensive<00:03:33.930> because

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
thing's really really defensive because

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.020 
thing's really really defensive because
I<00:03:34.560> mean<00:03:34.829> my<00:03:34.979> Metagross<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.609> relatively

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
I mean my Metagross is relatively

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.569 
I mean my Metagross is relatively
powerful<00:03:36.419> I'd<00:03:36.750> say<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.979> it's<00:03:38.099> not<00:03:38.280> doing<00:03:38.549> that

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
powerful I'd say and it's not doing that

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.819 
powerful I'd say and it's not doing that
much<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.299> porygon<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.199> go<00:03:40.650> out<00:03:40.799> to

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
much to the porygon so I go out to

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.670 
much to the porygon so I go out to
gliscor<00:03:41.639> predicting<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> discharge<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.379> now

gliscor predicting the discharge and now

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.319 
gliscor predicting the discharge and now
I<00:03:43.709> want<00:03:44.009> to<00:03:44.069> see<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:44.280> he<00:03:44.430> has<00:03:44.519> ice<00:03:44.699> beam<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.239> I'm

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329

he's gonna ice beam me I lots works out

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.039 
he's gonna ice beam me I lots works out
well<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.729> don't<00:03:50.970> get<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.209> fries<00:03:51.449> hack<00:03:51.689> so

that's<00:03:52.379> good<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.829> go<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.489> superpower<00:03:54.090> choice

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
that's good I go for a superpower choice

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.819 
that's good I go for a superpower choice
banded<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:55.139> going<00:03:55.259> to<00:03:55.319> take<00:03:55.500> out<00:03:55.709> the

porygon too and he doesn't switch

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.219 
porygon too and he doesn't switch
useless<00:03:59.009> crit<00:03:59.569> because<00:04:00.569> that's<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.079> a

actually<00:04:13.889> slacks<00:04:14.370> off<00:04:14.639> so<00:04:14.939> I<00:04:14.970> mean<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.329> okay

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
actually slacks off so I mean it's okay

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.960 
actually slacks off so I mean it's okay
i<00:04:15.930> can<00:04:16.320> reach<00:04:16.650> my<00:04:16.829> Noctowl<00:04:17.280> whenever<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.729> need

actually

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
actually

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.320 
actually
hits<00:04:23.050> he<00:04:23.680> doesn't<00:04:24.010> well<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.000> probably<00:04:25.120> on

tues out of my way anyway so that's fine
so<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.790> decided<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.180> switch<00:04:28.389> out<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.900> I'm<00:04:29.020> going

I<00:04:36.820> didn't<00:04:37.210> want<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.810> go<00:04:37.930> for<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.139> setup<00:04:38.440> mainly

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
I didn't want to go for the setup mainly

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.350 
I didn't want to go for the setup mainly
because<00:04:39.130> he<00:04:39.370> might<00:04:39.520> wake<00:04:39.669> up<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.060> break<00:04:40.210> my

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
sub and carmines and stuff won't be that

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.430 
sub and carmines and stuff won't be that
useful<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.750> going<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> finish<00:04:44.229> this

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
useful so I'm just going to finish this

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.780 
useful so I'm just going to finish this

and Riku still looking ok so brings in
medicham<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.130> predict<00:04:54.490> he's<00:04:54.580> going<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:54.820> go

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
medicham and I predict he's going to go
