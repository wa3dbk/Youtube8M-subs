but the end but the other thing with a
part<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> guitar<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.469> think<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.829> needs<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> be

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
part of guitar I think it needs to be

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.549 
part of guitar I think it needs to be
pretty<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.179> needs<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.809> lots<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
pretty I think it needs to have lots of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
pretty I think it needs to have lots of
attention<00:00:55.859> to<00:00:56.219> detail<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> my

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
attention to detail and that's one of my

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.770 
attention to detail and that's one of my
aims<00:00:58.589> with<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> stripe<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> say<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.659> down

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
aims with this stripe and say going down

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.490 
aims with this stripe and say going down
it'll<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.140> back<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.280> soundboard<00:01:03.350> western<00:01:04.350> red

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
and and the walnut combination that I've

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120 
and and the walnut combination that I've
used<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.450> number<00:01:24.480> of<00:01:24.840> times<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.500> steel<00:01:25.830> string

used a number of times on steel string

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.490 
used a number of times on steel string
guitars<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> produces<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.750> brilliant

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
guitars and it produces a very brilliant

guitars and it produces a very brilliant
morover<00:01:29.160> sound<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.660> think<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> tendency

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
morover sound and I think a tendency

morover sound and I think a tendency
with<00:01:32.250> small<00:01:32.580> body<00:01:32.880> still<00:01:33.810> string<00:01:34.110> guitars<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
with small body still string guitars is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520 
with small body still string guitars is
for<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.010> sound<00:01:35.310> very<00:01:35.430> bright<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
for them to sound very bright so what I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
for them to sound very bright so what I
want<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.830> do<00:01:37.980> is<00:01:38.250> offset<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.030> brightness

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
want to do is offset that brightness

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.260 
want to do is offset that brightness
with<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.200> choice<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.370> tone<00:01:41.700> words<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
with the choice of of my tone words I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.820 
with the choice of of my tone words I
think<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.900> other<00:01:43.080> thing<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.560> nice<00:01:43.770> about

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
think the other thing that's nice about

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.950 
think the other thing that's nice about
this

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.360 
this
just<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.170> purely<00:01:46.470> aesthetic<00:01:46.590> point<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
just from a purely aesthetic point of

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.610 
just from a purely aesthetic point of

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
view is there is it a little bit darker

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.310 
view is there is it a little bit darker
than<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.370> Spruce<00:01:50.730> and<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> guitar<00:01:51.930> that's

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
here you can see the bracing pattern I'm

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.790 
here you can see the bracing pattern I'm
going<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.869> use<00:02:08.110> I'm<00:02:08.950> going<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.310> X<00:02:10.090> bracing

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
braces which simply aren't strong enough

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.820 
braces which simply aren't strong enough
for<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:21.190> first<00:02:21.370> four<00:02:21.640> steel<00:02:21.819> strings<00:02:22.830> I've

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
for the first four steel strings I've

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.610 
for the first four steel strings I've
worked<00:02:24.130> out<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.610> general<00:02:25.180> position<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.930> where

worked out the general position of where

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.990 
worked out the general position of where
the<00:02:26.920> braces<00:02:27.489> are<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:28.000> go<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.430> overall

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
braces will be something that will

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.520 
braces will be something that will

and<00:03:34.470> then<00:03:34.620> also<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:35.010> need<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.310> make<00:03:35.490> an<00:03:35.610> external

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
and then also I need to make an external

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.890 
and then also I need to make an external
mod<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.230> into<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.980> external<00:03:38.640> mod<00:03:38.850> part<00:03:39.720> with
