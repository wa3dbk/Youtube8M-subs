gears so that's how I think that was
similar<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.590> I'm<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> bad<00:02:44.459> thing<00:02:44.610> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
similar in but I'm not a bad thing to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.100 
similar in but I'm not a bad thing to
stand<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.209> yourself<00:02:45.599> especially<00:02:45.989> when

fun<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.209> guess<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.980> know<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.220> you've

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
fun I guess just to know that you've

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520 
fun I guess just to know that you've
known<00:03:08.970> someone<00:03:09.269> for<00:03:09.540> quite<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> while<00:03:10.019> and

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
known someone for quite a while and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.000 
known someone for quite a while and
you're<00:03:11.010> able<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.430> share<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.739> things

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
you're able to share you know things

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.320

that<00:03:14.099> are<00:03:14.190> really<00:03:14.340> close<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:14.910> heart<00:03:15.120> in

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
that are really close to your heart in

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.789 
that are really close to your heart in
terms<00:03:15.599> of<00:03:15.750> training<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.170> things<00:03:16.380> like<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
terms of training and things like that I

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.860 
terms of training and things like that I
think<00:03:17.280> that's<00:03:17.370> probably<00:03:17.760> been<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.150> little<00:03:18.599> bit

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
think that's probably been a little bit

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.099 
think that's probably been a little bit
easier<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:20.280> me<00:03:20.670> I'm<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.150> sure<00:03:21.359> that<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.750> that

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
easier for me I'm not sure that is that

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.849 
easier for me I'm not sure that is that
and<00:03:23.000> having<00:03:24.000> some<00:03:24.329> fresh<00:03:24.660> faces<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.530> not

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
and having some fresh faces not it not

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.680 
and having some fresh faces not it not
just<00:03:25.980> as<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.609> having<00:03:26.850> some<00:03:26.970> fresh<00:03:27.150> faces<00:03:27.329> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
just as but having some fresh faces in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.080 
just as but having some fresh faces in
the<00:03:27.780> team<00:03:28.019> does<00:03:28.260> mix<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.010> up<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.670> keeps<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the team does mix it up and it keeps the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.660 
the team does mix it up and it keeps the
group<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.570> happy<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:32.190> we're<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
group really happy and I think we're the
