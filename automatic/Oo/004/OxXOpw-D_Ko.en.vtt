the cartridge this results in a rapid
expansion<00:01:12.760> of<00:01:13.060> gas<00:01:13.390> within<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.049> chamber

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
expansion of gas within the chamber

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.859 
expansion of gas within the chamber
which<00:01:15.130> forces<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.729> bullet<00:01:16.090> forward<00:01:16.600> and

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
which forces the bullet forward and

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.760 
which forces the bullet forward and
ejects<00:01:17.320> its<00:01:17.560> casing<00:01:18.510> this<00:01:19.510> energy<00:01:20.200> also

ejects its casing this energy also

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.100 
ejects its casing this energy also
produces<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.400> brief<00:01:21.729> muzzle<00:01:22.330> flash<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.990> a
