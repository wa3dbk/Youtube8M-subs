 You are greeted by a channel related stories 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.230
 Today I will tell how to tie summer 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.660
 coat 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.290
 sleeve consists of five parts three parts 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.920
 connected on knitting needles or typewriter 2 parts 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.970
 crochet 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.560
 the upper part we type 34 loops 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.349
 close 18 loops only 4 decreases 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.090
 every second row 2 loops average 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.369
 part 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.190
 we collect 100 loops after decreasing 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.650
 sixty-eight loops remain knit 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.580
 thirty eight rows on the fourth row 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:43.150
 remove 6 loops and five more decreases 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.879
 2 loops on each side through seven 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.540
 rows and bottom thirty-eight 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.170
 rows 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.019
 we collect 100 loops and knit without decreasing 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.220
 crochet inserts between them 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.140
 how to tie a square see the video 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.850
 connecting crocheted parts 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.850
 and how to connect the square itself, see the video 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.720
 crochet openwork square links 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.020
 on both videos you see on screen either you 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.220
 can find them in the description for this video 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.070
 on youtube 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 the bottom consists of four owe them 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.700
 squares 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.560
 the upper part consists of one square 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.450
 and two halves 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.450
 it now remains only to sew them 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.219
 For example, the upper part show how 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:47.670
 remove the thread first cut 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:49.970
 thread from two sides and then pull out 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.970
 a thread 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.509
 leave only one row of waste thread 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.509
 cut off the excess thread 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.290
 gradually dissolving we collect loops for 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.160
 why such difficulties if knit without 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:26.160
 waste thread then the edge will turn out much 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.550
 thicker we do not need it for the seam because 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.760
 on top will be our this detail related 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.760
 crochet 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.019
 so we collect every loop 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.950
 so that the loop does not work 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.870
 disbanded before starting work all 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.970
 parts need to be well soared 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.560
 we process every detail and on the sleeves 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.160
 and in front of me with the back 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.160
 Iâ€™m on top of my usual needle 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.540
 I will process it down after 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.230
 sew the sleeve so that the processing was on 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.019
 circle seamlessly now tell how connected 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.820
 before the top of thirty eight 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.209
 rows 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:22.350
 scored 28 loops 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:27.680
 closed 23 loops made a drop again 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:31.170
 one loop through seven rows at the gate 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.600
 insert consisting of one square with 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.299
 configured on both sides of the triangle 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.569
 mi the second part is also thirty eight 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.709
 rows scored sixty seven loops with 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.160
 one side 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.290
 gate slips every 7 rows one by one 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.030
 loop only five delays 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.680
 on the other side of the armhole on 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.970
 fourth row remove 6 loops immediately 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.459
 further 6 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:05.760
 ubavok on 2 sts every five rows and 2 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:10.109
 increments of 2 loops through six rows 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.930
 the remaining 32 loops close and three more 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:16.169
 parts are connected and on cars or knitting and 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.680
 two crochet details sixty seven 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.760
 loops 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.900
 thirty eight rows without a hitch 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.729
 fourth part 60 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.490
 there are loops thirty eight rows without 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:34.380
 down and fifth 63 loops 30 rows 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.060
 the coat was slightly narrowed down the label I did 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:43.039
 so as not to confuse the parts and between them 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.500
 crocheted squares now back 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.039
 the first part of the gate forty five loops 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:55.650
 below ninety-four loops of reductions on 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:05:00.389
 shoulder 12 decreases 2 loops every second 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.970
 a row of 32 rows next crochet rate 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.039
 from four squares the second part 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.389
 one hundred and fourteen loops on top 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.020
 scored 158 5 total thirty eight 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.340
 rows 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:18.270
 down on the fourth row down 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:23.370
 Immediately six loops further 6 decreases by 2 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.380
 loops through three rows and 2 decreases through 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.680
 six rows 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.199
 the rate is already 6 squares due to the fact that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.500
 coat is presented there is a small 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.800
 the difference in the width of the parts but the squares 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.500
 do not finish building such a difference 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.340
 width is easily leveled by plasticity 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.310
 knitwear 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.690
 the third part is thirty eight rows but 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.900
 took 158 5 closed one hundred forty eight 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.199
 loops 5 sleeves with one natal loop 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.349
 each country through seven rows middle 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:03.300
 noted to sew a slap 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:05.130
 crocheted piece of 7 squares 4 piece 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.520
 thirty eight rows 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.520
 one hundred fifty six loops without decreasing 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.400
 an insert of 6 squares and the bottom 30 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.070
 rows 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.410
 155 and the back is also slightly narrowed down
