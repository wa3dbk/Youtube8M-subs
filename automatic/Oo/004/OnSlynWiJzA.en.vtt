00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.280
 a favor take the ball 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.410
 you talk with the ball and talking and has 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.570
 slept many days with him and until today 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.790
 with I'm training I say my mother 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.950
 so tiny and tales of joy of 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.770
 shit 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.960
 of containment is not waiting for this 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.780
 demand answers me more the thing if I say 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 I had a lot of fun with her how many and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 how many huge moments of the past has 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 spent my life because of a ball 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.450
 put next to the side of the bed and the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 day and I do not know let's see 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.750
 it's one thing 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 and that many times with beckham as 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.690
 can 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.330
 We make history with the ball with 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.920
 a little thing like this and little to 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.420
 little are taking away weight and are 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.629
 improving the quality of the ball so that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.220
 entity to stop it but that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 what have you done to me 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 all the history that I have I have in the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.680
 football to the in of the players that I have 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.570
 played because this is responsible for 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 everything I have I'm going to change the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.010
 ball for a ball 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 the boot of the left foot 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.790
 because I want him to take us to the wheel 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.440
 tonight franz and the goal against france 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 I guess I 've reviewed it many times in 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.070
 you have seen your head too but not 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.380
 I ride at the moment you put the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.080
 ball on the ground you know you're going to 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.700
 hit safe you know how you're going to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.719
 hit 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.300
 the first thing that will continue with the part 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.820
 harder to over there 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.490
 after listening I've never heard 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.950
 saying is very far for you and 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.960
 after starting from miedito saga what 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.120
 will be commented on the bench that if I 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.160
 put goal from there that distance of 35 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.840
 meters the ceibal of the bench but not 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.750
 if I were a bench and want to speed up 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.060
 the coach does not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.060
 already the first thing that has come for me 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.550
 the domain for here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.220
 I put the ball with the part that part 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.099
 that harder not of that part that more 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.170
 hard put it directly if someone 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.170
 ends custom has been so 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 Natural I looked at him he looked at him 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 found I put the ball 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.580
 the ball was not to do so much 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.260
 effect was not for so much 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.620
 but I knew that ball was going to the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.620
 goal 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.819
 and once I had the boot very fair 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.829
 on the foot 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.790
 which always keeps me always have 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.910
 made to measure 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.820
 and I say 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.010
 opened what happens and is sure of this 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.900
 sure story of your story with those 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.269
 boots 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.459
 and he's there among the most goals 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.040
 important of my career at the time 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.450
 in which you see the ball that goes away you think 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.409
 which is not interesting because the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.400
 people sometimes do 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:17.629
 you agree additional inquiries and that's not 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.629
 there is one there is no explanation 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.810
 door entry I do not have the explanation 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.440
 like a one person is going to try 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.070
 explain what the ball has done 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.819
 it's destiny's thing a goal to 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.650
 never forget 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.950
 and with some boots that are in the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.950
 history 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:50.000
 on the barrier with the outside of the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.450
 barrier they look back and they go 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.120
 leaving because the barrier is here the 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.120
 ball has made an incredible parabola 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.530
 and if he was laughing because he said 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.110
 only you can do things like this and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.860
 I told him you can do it too and 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.450
 if he had a phenomenon and history are 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.840
 stories to tell 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.760
 and you have insurance photos you have everything 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.080
 I have Bogota I have the shirt 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.080
 value not because they have not given me 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 yes
