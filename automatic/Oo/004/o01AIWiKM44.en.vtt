00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 so dear viva friends my man of the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.259
 match marathon continues around the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.280
 next card is robert lewandowski man 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.860
 of the match the nice gentleman is 24 years 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.320
 old 1 80 big 78 kilo heavy comes from 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.720
 poland striker strong foot working right 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.779
 guess ^ ^ weak foot many stars 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.180
 special movement three stars on it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.760
 As always, we'll go a little bit closer later 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.519
 a physical attribute like a green one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 traffic light 85 85 agility 84 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.940
 balance 81 energy 90 reaction 95 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
 print speed 95 and power 82 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 So it looks very good 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.649
 He is also very good hope for him 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 even the mental attributes are for 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.129
 the attack also well developed 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 Aggressiveness 85 and positional play 86 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.110
 is definitely his 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.270
 Attributes attributes allow him to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.899
 a would be the best striker in the game 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 with ball control 91 81 dribbling 88 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.549
 graduation 99 head at precision 87 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 Fernschuss 87 elfmeter 79 was 86 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.240
 98 and volley 94 is everything 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.270
 the dark green what a striker 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.369
 just important is and put it all 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.689
 I want to take that as well now 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.740
 talk to you about it or you yes 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.780
 clear up 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.049
 which in the scenes really is very 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.610
 there are many things you can do a lot 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.650
 to conclude from his actions 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.780
 but we are now first but also 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.490
 probably the worst point because 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 I think that was good 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.869
 let's see why he is only 86 on the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 card has been put there times me 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 do not know because the values ​​speak 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.579
 actually for more 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 but apart from the eleven meter value 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.320
 nonetheless, he is simply one 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.520
 bomb striker that is clear and he will 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 Also getting better there will be next 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 year definitely better its fifa than 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.520
 this year but then maybe 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.630
 at fc bavaria munich well let good 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 Just surprise us 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.229
 you have already seen the clips oh 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 you shit the type is final 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.340
 So in the penalty area, the guy is almost 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.290
 indomitable when the angle is halfway 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.899
 Actual is actually true 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.530
 really every ball in there and see you 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.300
 times this messed shot 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.430
 every 16 that is very, very 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.410
 dangerous problem is you get the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.890
 because not always put down because the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.620
 blocks 2 and 3 so high and he rides 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.910
 works a lot with backwards though 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.950
 also a lot with forward 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.130
 this is the endurance he is 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.040
 not the fastest with 84 paces 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.560
 he if he is persistent weak clearly 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.530
 slower so I have some extreme 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.260
 problems with them somehow halfway 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.280
 possible each box sometimes 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.870
 then you have to come across others 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.489
 play the detours and easy 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.680
 hope that lewandowski with forward 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.970
 runs because if he does not do that then yes 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.470
 stop someone else has to the financial statements 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.360
 In my opinion, one may look up 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.060
 no case as a single striker 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.569
 for example , 43 are 21 or 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.880
 4-3-3 where he really is the central point 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.280
 In the storm that is alive there simply was missing 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.630
 too often as a medium striker I do not have 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.880
 of course he could play clearly 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.590
 be more effective just outside the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.209
 sixteen because his short-circuits are 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.870
 actually pretty horny poor 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.560
 relative and 80s will be whether 86 or so 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.269
 a man comes his own 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.870
 shooting power to the shooting gallery easy 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.220
 on the cap 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.930
 The keeper does not come ran that was 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.090
 just too blatant for him if we are now 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.790
 times his notable in games stop watching 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.290
 with 99 firing force 98 reaction 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.840
 95 94 91 ball control 89 long shot 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.660
 you just see oh you shit the guy 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.760
 is really a beast in attack 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.769
 that because there are a few points 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.299
 had to pull off was finally stop 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.320
 not the fastest, respectively 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.180
 often is really often caught up and yourself 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.769
 partly almost impossible to enforce 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.090
 also here of the five degrees I know 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.090
 that you know exactly who that was the team 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.200
 you always have to get caught without problems 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.239
 See how best to go through 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.730
 fight and play through my opinion 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.769
 after he is most effective around the 16th 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.590
 around and in the 16er in it of course 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.709
 whenever possible with the right foot and 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.840
 then best just under 25 meters 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.709
 I say then effectively we look 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.790
 the 16th 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.060
 that's close to the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.019
 with the elfmeterpunkt our kram 25 20 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.519
 up to 25 meters 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.220
 It will be really effective if you 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.410
 let's go so far with him as how 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.020
 said his strength in my opinion 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.210
 can not always enforce well there 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.340
 82 defend many defenders 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.600
 but often it goes pretty well 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.550
 back off and really stops losing 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.710
 many battles with the people 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.360
 whom I talked with or 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.030
 I've played against 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.650
 all said in the penalty ez breed type 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.910
 lethal as completely turned over though 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.889
 outside the sixteen you get 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.759
 halt almost nothing about him with the 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.039
 he really gets a few 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.620
 Minus points and because you have to stop there 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.970
 just look at the price 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.190
 or will we be short again ? 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.530
 player trades he only says one 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.389
 trade and dustin jeffrey his name 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.280
 It just rarely hurts 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.169
 totally unnecessary because in the ultimate team 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.380
 mode vulnerable anyway, almost nobody 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.240
 So now, of course, that's the conclusion 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.919
 most important for a player is one 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.110
 must of course take that into account 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.930
 the pc costs just under three million 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.870
 the playstation 3 950,000 on the xbox 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.699
 have nearly 900,000 on the per side 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.620
 Of course we have a perfect conclusion 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.880
 In the criminal area the type is one of the 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.360
 finish strongest game on penalty room 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.099
 I've ever had in fifa 13 has the 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.380
 you can say so clearly as long as he's with you 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.930
 the right foot shoots it is right 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.490
 really blatant about what, of course, this 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.530
 say something very supportive 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.789
 precise body protection now and then goes 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.440
 about body protection outside the 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.360
 sixteen you have to enter 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.110
 practice a little then that should not 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.810
 be a problem 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.789
 from 25 meters good depping long shot 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.199
 rather, or to fight back and miss 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.229
 Just give them the player trade long 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.289
 short tracker logically then clean 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.639
 Short passes can be left so so 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.560
 they are really fine 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.780
 and actually speak against his 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.880
 who pass with 68 of course that is natural 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.070
 also flank et cetera then refer 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.750
 one of the strongest or strongest 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.940
 conclusion of the bundesliga he has 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.280
 definitely no question 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.419
 there can not be a royce man of the match or 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.099
 otherwise keep up 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.470
 although here it is also about the pure 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.110
 Striker position then goes on the contra 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.060
 often slower than 84 paces 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.129
 Of course that's because he 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.919
 easy 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.169
 yes how should you say it's just missing 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.599
 just really need the others 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.479
 perseverance for the rocklady 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.309
 the next point of criticism is with hey 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.169
 out of place for a striker that they 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:33.029
 either has to change moderately in game 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.679
 which does not always really bring something 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.569
 and or you just find yourself 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.069
 so that he almost finished the end of the game 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.599
 can not really walk anymore 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.249
 because you have to see that it is properly 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:44.429
 to find the right conclusion 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:47.069
 on page 16 he just is not like that 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:48.209
 In fact, he hardly ever manages himself 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.159
 bad with that prevail 

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.080
 dribbling is not so cool for that 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.179
 that it actually has worth 86s 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.699
 headballs not so strong either 

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:58.709
 really easy shoot at 25 meters 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.050
 no matter how the balls go in almost always 

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:03.539
 price on the pc of course utopian 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.009
 Of course he does not get a thumb after 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.439
 in my opinion he has that 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.689
 taking into account the pc price 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:11.519
 and the counterpoints do not deserve 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.589
 a thumb would be to get up 

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.909
 the price on the pc at just 1.2 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:17.300
 Millions would probably come 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:20.759
 look different but for three million 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.259
 he is not really worth 3 stars 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:24.659
 who would like to have him if afford 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.119
 can he can pick himself otherwise 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:29.939
 that really is not really that 

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:31.800
 attached price in my opinion 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:34.439
 I just do not think so 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.259
 justified conclusion by just that 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:37.769
 only four and a half stars or three and a half 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:40.169
 stars 

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:42.029
 because as already said the workplace 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.740
 pull him down extremely that gnaws 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.259
 his endurance that just likes the 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.029
 performance we in midfield he brings it 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.579
 is not there to build my game 

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:51.649
 and or he would like to be there but he 

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.969
 it is not 

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:56.339
 accordingly, all this draws a bit 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:57.990
 otherwise quite clear on his performance 

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:00.149
 one of the best strikers at the moment 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.829
 in fifa 13 there is who bock has the 

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:03.779
 should try it out if it is 

00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.669
 can afford to try 

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:07.499
 one does not make a mistake with it 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:11.119
 as far as the way he is 

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:11.119
 plays well
