macbook<00:00:59.100> pro<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.820> might<00:01:00.059> even<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.480> new<00:01:00.840> imacs

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
macbook pro we might even see new imacs

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.630 
macbook pro we might even see new imacs
as<00:01:01.620> well<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.070> new<00:01:02.309> mac<00:01:02.640> minis<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.359> well<00:01:03.920> fmw<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
as well as new mac minis as well fmw the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
as well as new mac minis as well fmw the
imax<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.360> mac<00:01:06.659> minis<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.680> overdue

imax and mac minis are way overdue

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.679 
imax and mac minis are way overdue
actually<00:01:09.000> thought<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.570> be

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
actually thought these would be

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.510 
actually thought these would be
refreshed<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.380> summer<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> hasn't

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
refreshed in the summer but it hasn't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
refreshed in the summer but it hasn't
happened<00:01:11.610> yet<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.000> hopefully<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.140> long

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
happened yet so hopefully that long

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.780 
happened yet so hopefully that long
delay<00:01:13.710> will<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.040> worth<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> wait<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> don't

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
delay will be worth the wait I don't

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
delay will be worth the wait I don't
think<00:01:15.030> we'll<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.240> anything<00:01:15.570> change<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.110> far

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
think we'll see anything change as far

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
think we'll see anything change as far
as<00:01:16.350> form<00:01:16.619> factor<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> mac<00:01:17.280> mini<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:18.060> was
