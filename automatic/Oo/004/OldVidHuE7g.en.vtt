00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
you all saw us about multitasking so we

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.840 
you all saw us about multitasking so we
thought<00:00:12.920> what<00:00:13.070> better<00:00:13.100> way<00:00:13.309> to<00:00:13.400> show<00:00:13.639> it<00:00:13.730> off

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
thought what better way to show it off

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.609 
thought what better way to show it off
than<00:00:14.029> to<00:00:14.119> multitask<00:00:14.539> some<00:00:14.809> games<00:00:15.049> now

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
than to multitask some games now

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.410 
than to multitask some games now
inaudible<00:00:15.920> games<00:00:16.279> work<00:00:16.520> perfectly<00:00:17.210> because

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
inaudible games work perfectly because

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.640 
inaudible games work perfectly because
they<00:00:17.600> need<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:17.900> be<00:00:17.990> optimized<00:00:18.350> for<00:00:18.380> this

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
they need to be optimized for this

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.060 
they need to be optimized for this
gorgeous<00:00:19.550> display<00:00:19.759> but<00:00:20.750> some<00:00:21.199> games<00:00:21.439> do<00:00:21.830> we're

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
gonna die pretty soon so before we do we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.390 
gonna die pretty soon so before we do we
might<00:00:53.150> as<00:00:53.390> well<00:00:53.650> jump<00:00:54.650> out<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:55.010> here

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
might as well jump out of here

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
maybe swipe that out of the way jump

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.290 
maybe swipe that out of the way jump
into<00:00:57.650> another<00:00:57.680> game<00:00:58.100> let's<00:00:58.430> say<00:00:58.670> eternity

jumping<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.789> took<00:01:32.000> maybe<00:01:32.299> more<00:01:32.539> graphically

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
jumping in took maybe more graphically

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.770 
jumping in took maybe more graphically
intensive<00:01:33.439> game<00:01:33.649> like<00:01:33.829> a<00:01:33.859> bard's<00:01:34.280> tale<00:01:34.599> we<00:01:35.599> can

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
see jumping in here we haven't actually

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.240 
see jumping in here we haven't actually
played<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.509> game<00:01:41.599> all<00:01:41.929> that<00:01:42.140> much<00:01:42.379> but<00:01:43.039> we

great great game it's quite nice and
graphically<00:01:49.250> intensive<00:01:49.959> if<00:01:50.959> we<00:01:51.110> go<00:01:51.289> back

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
graphically intensive if we go back

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.319 
graphically intensive if we go back
upstairs<00:01:51.679> actually<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.459> can<00:01:52.640> talk<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:53.119> some

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
unlike a lot of games mouths move when

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.779 
unlike a lot of games mouths move when
you<00:01:59.840> talk<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.200> people<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:01.609> actual

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
you talk to people the actual

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.690 
you talk to people the actual
interaction<00:02:02.359> was<00:02:02.689> really<00:02:02.959> nice<00:02:03.369> still<00:02:04.369> voice

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700

bounce calls and we can all do it at a
pretty<00:02:52.250> phenomenal<00:02:52.700> frame<00:02:53.510> rate<00:02:53.980> we're<00:02:54.980> not

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
pretty phenomenal frame rate we're not

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.520 
pretty phenomenal frame rate we're not
they<00:02:56.540> go

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.380 

we're<00:03:00.070> in<00:03:00.160> support<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.640> lot<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.090> would<00:03:01.210> not

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
we're in support a lot that would not

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
slowdown really really impressive so

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.680 
slowdown really really impressive so
it's<00:03:56.049> really<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.769> menus<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:58.299> give<00:03:58.540> us

some<00:03:58.720> grief<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.440> same<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.890> be<00:03:59.920> said<00:04:00.040> of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
some grief and the same can be said of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.160

the<00:04:03.040> game<00:04:03.310> actually<00:04:03.519> suffers<00:04:04.299> as<00:04:04.450> well<00:04:04.690> and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
the game actually suffers as well and

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.839 
the game actually suffers as well and
we're<00:04:05.410> not<00:04:05.530> sure<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.160> we<00:04:06.250> can<00:04:06.370> jump<00:04:06.609> straight

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
we're not sure if we can jump straight

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.490 
we're not sure if we can jump straight
into<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.180> because<00:04:07.389> it's<00:04:07.569> actually<00:04:07.750> reset<00:04:08.349> the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
into it because it's actually reset the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.280 
into it because it's actually reset the
game<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.730> what<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.209> does<00:04:10.389> is<00:04:10.630> actually<00:04:10.840> keeps

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
game but what it does is actually keeps

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.050 
game but what it does is actually keeps
everything<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.549> center<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.430> just

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
everything in the center so it just

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.270 
everything in the center so it just
isn't<00:04:16.389> really<00:04:16.660> playable<00:04:17.200> you'll<00:04:17.680> want<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.010> try

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
isn't really playable you'll want to try

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.370 
isn't really playable you'll want to try
