00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.139
 past already past shame this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.280
 you have to wait half an hour for it to pass 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.960
 next one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 no, because I paused with those 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 practices of the director cliche that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 he had started yesterday that I had to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.609
 finish me today plus they have half an hour 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 hedgehog breaks even to do things 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.019
 holy god feel to pass the time of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 go to make child's play when 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.630
 we were waiting for the bus to go to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.930
 school we play games to pass 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.719
 time came so early 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.219
 the bus happens to play then it's ok 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.200
 at war this is what is beautiful 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.670
 you think a character not a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.250
 famous person can be a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930
 political a singer an actor and pieces 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.020
 a character and no excuse I think so 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 have arrived boss I think a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 famous political show character 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.579
 what you have five questions of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
 time to understand that the character that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.789
 you five questions can not exceed 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.129
 five questions after the 5 questions if 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.580
 you guess you lost okay ok you get it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 the game 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.430
 I think the character is never thought 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.080
 go or you understand the game 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.090
 I think the famous person you owe 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.950
 ask five questions that obviously are 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.250
 clues no I root for individuals 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 talented little I know when those 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.830
 is an Italian and foreign is who I am 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.420
 things like that and I understood five questions 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.729
 and you understand no ok but marcello 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.830
 mastroianni is not understood the game if not 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.220
 you ask me questions it's hard for you 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 can guess sorry to the bartenders is one 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.250
 chance on a billion you have to do me 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.360
 I have to give you the clues you need to do 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.550
 questions understood go kennedy john 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.940
 fitzgerald kennedy 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.940
 then 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.219
 if you don't ask me the questions how do you do a 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.020
 dominate understood by adriano celentano yes 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.549
 he's rooted he never had an ass like that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.799
 unbelievable that it never happens happens 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.140
 once up over a billion and so 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.640
 Now let's do something. I'll do it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.440
 see the game as it is now the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 we do the opposite and you think it is a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.870
 character and I try to guess 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.989
 so I'll show you how the game 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 then I thought then let's start with 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.860
 the first question is higher than one 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.569
 shoe box 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.799
 so here is just a smurf for example 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.530
 to say want then is an actor 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.530
 no he is a politician 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.079
 no it is a singer is a singer is 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.099
 Italian and Italian I throw Gianni 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.739
 morandi 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.019
 who was happy cigliano family goes well 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.819
 however in any case do not guess also 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.680
 won however like the game I made there 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.120
 I had the chance to guess but 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.910
 I couldn't do it because I did the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.410
 questions so now you understand the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 so let's play let's come back like 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.620
 was the situation before I think a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.660
 character must guess it go gimondi 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.150
 you have to ask me questions the questions is higher 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.330
 of a shoe box is an actor and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.540
 a song to the questions go is bigger 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.500
 of a nicole shoe box 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.500
