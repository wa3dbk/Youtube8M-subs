00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
shoe pop a little bit more but in my

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
shoe pop a little bit more but in my
opinion<00:02:08.040> you<00:02:09.040> know<00:02:09.130> white<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:09.970> very<00:02:10.540> hard<00:02:10.780> to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
opinion you know white is very hard to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.500 
opinion you know white is very hard to
maintain<00:02:11.640> especially<00:02:12.640> with<00:02:13.060> winter<00:02:13.360> coming

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
maintain especially with winter coming

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.300 
maintain especially with winter coming
up<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> black<00:02:14.380> probably<00:02:15.010> would<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.220> been

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
up so the black probably would have been

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.670 
up so the black probably would have been
a<00:02:15.370> better<00:02:15.900> release<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.110> know<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> lot<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.500> people

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
