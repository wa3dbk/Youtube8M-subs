00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

opposite<00:00:00.450> edge<00:00:00.890> try<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:01.979> remove<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.399> like

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
opposite edge try and remove this like

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.139 
opposite edge try and remove this like
that

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
that

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.090 
that
then<00:00:03.449> we'll<00:00:03.600> come<00:00:03.780> back<00:00:03.810> over<00:00:04.110> here<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.620> get

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
then we'll come back over here and get

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.789 
then we'll come back over here and get
that<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.109> will<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.259> first<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
that so this one will be first the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.580 
that so this one will be first the
opposite<00:00:08.189> edge<00:00:08.510> and<00:00:09.510> hopefully<00:00:09.900> it'll<00:00:10.050> go<00:00:10.469> in

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
opposite edge and hopefully it'll go in

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.490 
opposite edge and hopefully it'll go in
here<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.800> remove<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.219> high<00:00:11.400> spot<00:00:18.289> all<00:00:19.289> right

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
here and remove that high spot all right

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.260 
here and remove that high spot all right
so<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.160> don't<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.580> high<00:00:20.730> spot<00:00:21.000> over

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so now we don't have a high spot over

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.840 
so now we don't have a high spot over
here<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.289> come<00:00:22.439> back<00:00:22.590> over<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:22.980> flip<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
here we can come back over here flip it

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.100 
here we can come back over here flip it
around<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:25.460> remove<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.000> here

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.479 

now<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.380> didn't<00:00:34.680> hit<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.829> hard<00:00:35.070> enough<00:00:35.130> I'll

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
now I didn't hit it hard enough I'll

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.520 
now I didn't hit it hard enough I'll
have<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> rebuild<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> platform<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.960> take

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
have to rebuild that platform and take

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.000 
have to rebuild that platform and take
another<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.950> off<00:00:39.110> all<00:00:40.110> right<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.710> made<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
another one off all right we made the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.430 
another one off all right we made the
platform<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.730> every<00:00:42.540> time<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> screw<00:00:43.350> up

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
platform there every time I screw up

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.170 
platform there every time I screw up
like<00:00:43.590> I'd<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> remake<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> platform<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
like I'd have to remake that platform I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
like I'd have to remake that platform I
lose<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.690> bit<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> width<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.399> need<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
lose a little bit of width so I need to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.540 
lose a little bit of width so I need to
get<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> groove<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:55.340> that's<00:00:56.340> more

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
get into the groove here that's more

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.290 
get into the groove here that's more
like<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.579 

here's<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> next<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:02.180> could<00:01:03.180> travel<00:01:03.589> pretty

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
here's the next one could travel pretty

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:13.530 
here's the next one could travel pretty
close<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> opposite<00:01:05.369> edge<00:01:05.519> here

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.870 

alright<00:01:16.950> okay<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:17.980> went<00:01:18.280> ahead<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:18.490> shut<00:01:18.760> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
alright okay I went ahead and shut the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.690 
alright okay I went ahead and shut the
video<00:01:19.120> camera<00:01:19.480> off<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> little<00:01:19.900> while<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.700> went

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
video camera off a little while and went

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.850 
video camera off a little while and went
ahead<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.060> took<00:01:22.360> some<00:01:22.570> more<00:01:22.780> flakes<00:01:23.440> off<00:01:23.650> his

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
ahead and took some more flakes off his

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.590 
ahead and took some more flakes off his
face<00:01:24.040> try<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:24.850> screw<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.060> up<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.270> little<00:01:25.360> bit

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
face try and screw it up a little bit

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.780 
face try and screw it up a little bit
okay<00:01:26.260> my<00:01:26.410> pretty<00:01:26.650> good<00:01:26.860> I've<00:01:27.070> got<00:01:27.100> one<00:01:27.670> little

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
okay my pretty good I've got one little

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.730 
okay my pretty good I've got one little
problem<00:01:28.120> area<00:01:28.480> right<00:01:28.690> there<00:01:28.930> but<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.350> think<00:01:29.440> I

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
problem area right there but I think I

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.920 
problem area right there but I think I
can<00:01:29.890> get<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.250> by<00:01:31.090> driving<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> flake<00:01:31.720> off

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
can get that by driving the flake off

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.320 
can get that by driving the flake off
over<00:01:32.260> here<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:33.430> way<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.730> got<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.940> do<00:01:34.030> now<00:01:34.180> is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
over here the way I got to do now is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.470 
over here the way I got to do now is
work<00:01:34.480> on<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.750> symmetry<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:36.330> also<00:01:37.330> on

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
work on the symmetry and also on

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.480 
work on the symmetry and also on
straightening<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.170> edge<00:01:39.010> here<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> little

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
straightening out the edge here a little

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.980 
straightening out the edge here a little
bit<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:43.090> can<00:01:43.120> see<00:01:43.420> there's<00:01:43.600> definitely<00:01:43.720> a

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
bit so you can see there's definitely a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.740 
bit so you can see there's definitely a
little<00:01:44.140> bit<00:01:44.230> of<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.500> twist<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.040> right<00:01:45.220> here

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
little bit of a twist in it right here

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.000 
little bit of a twist in it right here
so<00:01:46.750> I'm<00:01:47.140> going<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.380> lose<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.590> little<00:01:47.830> bit<00:01:47.920> of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
so I'm going to lose a little bit of

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.430 
so I'm going to lose a little bit of
width<00:01:48.250> doing<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:49.090> I'll<00:01:49.780> video<00:01:50.140> some<00:01:50.410> of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
width doing that and I'll video some of

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.060 
width doing that and I'll video some of
the<00:01:50.530> latter<00:01:50.740> stages<00:01:51.070> here<00:01:51.370> when<00:01:51.490> we<00:01:51.580> get<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.910> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the latter stages here when we get to it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.560 
the latter stages here when we get to it
here<00:01:54.070> was<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.220> plate<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.760> I<00:01:54.880> needed<00:01:55.120> to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
here was that plate that I needed to

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.510 
here was that plate that I needed to
remove<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:56.590> little<00:01:56.890> problem<00:01:57.040> that<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.310> had

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
remove this little problem that I had

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.710 
remove this little problem that I had
right<00:01:57.729> over<00:01:57.910> here<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.090> drove<00:01:58.390> went<00:01:58.600> off<00:01:58.690> over

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
right over here I drove went off over

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.880 
right over here I drove went off over
here<00:02:00.660> clean<00:02:01.660> that<00:02:01.870> up<00:02:01.900> real<00:02:02.229> nice<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.500> was<00:02:02.770> going

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
here clean that up real nice I was going

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.890 
here clean that up real nice I was going
to<00:02:02.950> video<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.430> but<00:02:03.640> thought<00:02:04.630> I'd<00:02:04.750> probably

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
to video it but thought I'd probably

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.980 
to video it but thought I'd probably
choke<00:02:05.260> up<00:02:05.500> or<00:02:05.680> something<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.810> helped<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.870> lot

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
choke up or something so helped a lot

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.510 
choke up or something so helped a lot
easier<00:02:08.290> on<00:02:08.320> camera<00:02:08.830> rolling<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.920> more<00:02:12.100> set<00:02:12.370> up

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
easier on camera rolling two more set up

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:26.570 
easier on camera rolling two more set up
right<00:02:12.700> here<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.030> here

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:38.309 

it's<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.360> we'll<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.540> right<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.930> here

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.960 

I'd<00:02:39.319> like<00:02:39.530> board<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.830> go<00:02:39.950> clean<00:02:40.220> over<00:02:40.489> here<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
I'd like board to go clean over here the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:53.410 
I'd like board to go clean over here the
opposite<00:02:41.360> edge<00:02:51.160> almost<00:02:52.160> made<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.880> gotta<00:02:53.269> get

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420

thing will be done all the dangerous
parts<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.930> are<00:03:03.049> over<00:03:03.709> with<00:03:04.220> now<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> don't

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
parts of it are over with now I don't

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.339 
parts of it are over with now I don't
take<00:03:04.940> as<00:03:05.090> much<00:03:05.239> risk<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.690> breaking<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.110> at<00:03:06.200> this

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
take as much risk of breaking it at this

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.470 
take as much risk of breaking it at this
point<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:06.830> basically<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:08.000> I'm<00:03:08.120> doing<00:03:08.150> is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
point but basically what I'm doing is

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.270 
point but basically what I'm doing is
I'm<00:03:08.660> taking<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.110> really<00:03:09.440> small<00:03:10.010> little

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
I'm taking this really small little

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.000 
I'm taking this really small little
three-quarter<00:03:10.760> inch<00:03:10.880> blocker<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.799> I'm<00:03:12.799> just

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
three-quarter inch blocker and I'm just

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.520 
three-quarter inch blocker and I'm just
going<00:03:13.250> around<00:03:13.340> here<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.000> getting<00:03:14.780> any<00:03:14.930> fixed

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
going around here and getting any fixed

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.650 
going around here and getting any fixed
spots<00:03:15.739> off<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.160> edge<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.910> 'true<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.329> up<00:03:17.450> down

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
spots off the edge and 'true it up down

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:29.759 
spots off the edge and 'true it up down
here<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.930> little<00:03:18.049> bit<00:03:18.200> more<00:03:20.590> that's<00:03:21.590> about<00:03:21.829> it

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.140 

slow<00:03:30.769> boppers<00:03:31.220> good<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.610> this<00:03:31.730> edge<00:03:31.910> work

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
slow boppers good for this edge work

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.640 
slow boppers good for this edge work
because<00:03:32.569> it's<00:03:33.500> got<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:33.980> nice<00:03:34.250> tight<00:03:34.579> radius<00:03:34.849> and

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
because it's got a nice tight radius and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.470 
because it's got a nice tight radius and
there's<00:03:36.650> very<00:03:36.890> little<00:03:37.099> risk<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.579> doing<00:03:38.239> any

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
there's very little risk of doing any

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
there's very little risk of doing any
serious<00:03:38.930> damage<00:03:40.930> okay<00:03:41.930> well<00:03:42.170> here's<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
serious damage okay well here's the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.970 
serious damage okay well here's the
finished<00:03:42.829> blade<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:45.500> didn't<00:03:45.739> do<00:03:45.799> any

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
finished blade and I didn't do any

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.309 
finished blade and I didn't do any
pressure<00:03:46.579> flaking<00:03:46.880> on<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.389> just<00:03:47.450> finished

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
pressure flaking on it I just finished

00:03:48.319 --> 00:04:30.130 
pressure flaking on it I just finished
it<00:03:48.440> up<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.799> small<00:03:49.040> Bopper

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.270 

and<00:04:30.590> let's<00:04:31.520> see<00:04:31.670> we<00:04:31.820> got<00:04:32.000> four<00:04:32.180> lengths<00:04:32.390> here

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
and let's see we got four lengths here

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:44.800 
and let's see we got four lengths here
it's<00:04:34.280> about

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.720 

alright<00:04:45.560> looks<00:04:46.160> like<00:04:46.310> it's<00:04:46.460> about<00:04:46.550> 23<00:04:47.360> and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
alright looks like it's about 23 and

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.890 
alright looks like it's about 23 and
three-quarter<00:04:49.730> inch<00:04:49.880> in<00:04:50.030> Lane<00:04:50.270> so<00:04:50.540> I<00:04:50.750> only

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
three-quarter inch in Lane so I only

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.020 
three-quarter inch in Lane so I only
lost<00:04:51.170> about<00:04:51.290> 1/4<00:04:51.650> inch<00:04:51.860> it's<00:04:52.160> just<00:04:52.340> under<00:04:52.580> 24

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
lost about 1/4 inch it's just under 24

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.540 
lost about 1/4 inch it's just under 24
inches<00:04:53.360> long<00:04:53.800> it's<00:04:54.800> about<00:04:54.860> what<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.250> started

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
inches long it's about what it started

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.450 
inches long it's about what it started
out<00:04:55.730> at<00:04:56.500> hopefully<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.860> Sun<00:04:58.040> will<00:04:58.100> come<00:04:58.310> out

with<00:05:04.820> all<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.000> majors<00:05:05.960> Falls<00:05:06.230> that<00:05:06.410> came<00:05:07.190> off

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
with all the majors Falls that came off

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.090 
with all the majors Falls that came off
in<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.639> earlier<00:05:08.000> stages<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.919> thing<00:05:09.919> weighs

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
in the earlier stages and thing weighs

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.430 
in the earlier stages and thing weighs
just<00:05:10.310> over<00:05:10.490> 4<00:05:10.910> pounds<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:11.510> it's<00:05:12.200> interesting

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
just over 4 pounds so it's interesting

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.340 
just over 4 pounds so it's interesting
that<00:05:12.770> it's<00:05:12.950> about<00:05:13.130> 1%<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.300> total<00:05:15.080> mass

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
that it's about 1% of the total mass

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.900 
that it's about 1% of the total mass
that<00:05:15.380> we<00:05:15.620> started<00:05:15.919> with<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.310> 300<00:05:16.760> pound

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
that we started with on the 300 pound

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.500 
that we started with on the 300 pound
Boulder<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:21.010> took<00:05:22.010> about<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.820> little<00:05:23.240> over<00:05:23.360> 8

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
Boulder and took about a little over 8

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:43.090 
Boulder and took about a little over 8
hours<00:05:23.540> to<00:05:24.020> complete

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:06:19.659 

I<00:05:43.190> put<00:05:43.850> it<00:05:43.940> over<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.150> grass<00:05:44.360> case<00:05:44.720> I<00:05:44.840> drop<00:05:44.990> it

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.509 

that's<00:06:20.330> it
