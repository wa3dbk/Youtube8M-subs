at the agriculture one gallon tank much

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.099 
at the agriculture one gallon tank much
more<00:02:32.510> space<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.739> more<00:02:34.359> wider<00:02:35.359> than<00:02:35.840> is

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
more space it's more wider than is

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.449 
more space it's more wider than is
taller<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.450> space<00:02:39.069> there's<00:02:40.069> more<00:02:40.340> of
