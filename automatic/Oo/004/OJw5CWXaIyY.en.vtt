00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.330
 hello to all your own product today 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.090
 how do you see the custard balls 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 angels in you have asked in so many and 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.770
 so and how it can do the product test 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.859
 to find them I had some 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.570
 difficulties in the sense that they are not 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.669
 enter the first supermarket and I have it 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.220
 found immediately I found it anyway 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.349
 new supermarket close enough one 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.960
 family so I had to run not 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.050
 relatively little however not in 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.290
 large supermarkets then 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.320
 all in all we say better ease 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.810
 to find it I'll tell you I tried it 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.430
 really just for you because i am a 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.920
 skeptical especially due to the fact that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.720
 I love the result of my cream 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.390
 pastry that if you haven't yet 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.910
 tried I recommend you try 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.170
 by clicking here, go directly to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.690
 video of custard 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.610
 today let's try this here and there 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 I immediately say what my doubt is like this 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.280
 which then we will go to see if less can 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.560
 remove and that will know mine of lemon 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.090
 custard and very tasty lemon 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.369
 you know because I put the escort in 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.070
 little bits inside and I love this 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.859
 strong lemon flavor I hope it is not 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.640
 too artificial but we'll see 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.679
 after 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.179
 now I'm going to read you first 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.930
 the ingredients that are inside 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.030
 of custard 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.220
 we have starch and modified sugar 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:40.150
 calcium sulfate sodium alginate of 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:43.570
 tetra sodium phosphate anna never heard e 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.360
 core comin then the product can 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.080
 contain traces of wheat milk eggs 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.810
 ready to shell and soy venir of mixed 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.390
 shop do not find new dehydrated 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.400
 inside as it is done with 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.440
 But the eggs are more brave than me 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.800
 probably one of these big words 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.869
 it means eggs and I don't know though 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.000
 we say to feeling by reading everyone 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.100
 these names I do n't know are not me 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.640
 it looks like supernatural and how 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.970
 always to Italy to give you a vote 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.550
 to this product at the note level 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.680
 ingredients let's see a little bit for the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.440
 preparation and preparation of each other 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.530
 they snap as always is something I do 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.680
 made her happy enough because without 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.459
 cooking immediately ready indeed for 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.070
 prepare this custard just 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.260
 pour the milk pour the envelope e 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.720
 mix with a whisk for two minutes e 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.590
 then very quick preparation then 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.840
 still much we say useful from even the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.360
 dose size of an envelope e 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.320
 that is, it says that with an envelope you can 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 make us a cake with a diameter of 24 or 18 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.250
 20 cream puffs therefore contrary however 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.220
 to what I thought with an envelope yes 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.580
 should be able to garnish once 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.480
 that's enough 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.980
 great to make the point la 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.290
 custard and not to sell anything 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 to add is milk and there 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.460
 250 or 300 ml will be needed depending on 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 in fact what you have to do says that 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.100
 in case you want to make one 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.320
 cream to put inside one 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.500
 cake 300 ml better to make it more 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.360
 liquid or 250 in the event that 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.280
 you should use for a tart with 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.190
 the fruit to make it denser 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.870
 so now let's go and prepare it I go 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.970
 then to take my container 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.660
 within which I am going to pour the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.490
 compound as you see and grainy e 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:53.200
 white as a smell I loved it first 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.320
 feels a bit let's say an aftertaste of 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.950
 lemon but very very light then 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.840
 we're going to see 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.530
 I'm staring at this thing 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.330
 lemon then it goes to pour everything 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.970
 the milk in this case I made the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:13.000
 try with the 300 ml put the whips e 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.980
 I go to mix says that to mix 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.169
 it will take two minutes to try 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.600
 precisely the two minutes 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.090
 two minutes have passed and here is the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.250
 cream that should be ready 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.520
 I find it really very much 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.610
 liquid therefore in the case in which precisely 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.610
 I recommend you use 250 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.690
 ml instead of 300 because I don't know about you but me 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.400
 I prefer it certainly more compact and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.560
 the time has come to give some 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.620
 then vote for this custard 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.190
 then first of all quality price 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.790
 I paid one euro and 99 then 2 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.400
 euro in short, let's say that inside 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.780
 they succeed in two envelopes to which you owe 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.560
 add milk 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.150
 if we count the first 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.580
 I'm done at home were the same 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.450
 quantity where you have to sell flour eggs 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.389
 sugar 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.410
 in short, we say that perhaps it is almost 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.850
 save 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.730
 we are talking about a few cents 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.430
 obviously, however, in reality, yes 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.980
 is almost saving by using the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.870
 custard ready what to do 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.950
 It usually doesn't happen because the products already 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.540
 ready 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.220
 you usually know they cost more 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.669
 compared to those made at home 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.830
 so let's say in this case I would give a 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.720
 good grade I would give a 7 for quality 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.470
 price 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.919
 7 because I don't like quality 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.070
 loved the look first and foremost 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:45.710
 because as I told you I find it a little 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:49.370
 too liquid then also a bit grainy 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.350
 foster does not look like me 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.190
 liked a lot but I'm a little bit 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:06:01.539
 the custard and then I would give a 6 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:04.520
 now let's go try it so locally 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:10.310
 you know I don't like doing big 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:15.650
 mouthfuls the Dominican look goes to 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.900
 flavor and grainy and then raw like 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.050
 I suspected it tasted a little 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.650
 artificial lemon and for me it feels 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.789
 too the slightly famous aftertaste 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.800
 the expected so I didn't like giving it 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:35.060
 let's say enough because 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.190
 charity is not starting, however, like vi 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.590
 I said it tasted better than that 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:45.139
 homemade I find it more artificial 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.669
 so well a 6 for that 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.669
 for what concerns the time of 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.550
 preparation instead I would give them a good one 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.890
 vote absolutely 18 because 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.380
 which prepares very long time also 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.090
 if it has become very fast, talk at home 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.040
 I bet you too have become 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.640
 fast but the two minutes of 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.550
 assembly are unbeatable then the 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.390
 my general vote from this cream 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.970
 pastry is a sailing medium is not a 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.800
 product that I preferred a lot though 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.380
 as always I tell you 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.570
 try them anyway if you are intrigued 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.380
 because obviously this is my taste 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.390
 staff 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.880
 I hope therefore that this review will 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.530
 be useful I hope you are useful too 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.720
