00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
of what is it this nail polish is free

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.190 
of what is it this nail polish is free
of<00:05:39.470> formaldehyde<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:40.490> lean<00:05:40.730> I<00:05:41.090> don't<00:05:41.990> know<00:05:42.080> how

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
of formaldehyde to lean I don't know how

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.159 
of formaldehyde to lean I don't know how
to<00:05:42.290> say<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.470> other<00:05:42.650> thing<00:05:42.880> but<00:05:43.880> um<00:05:44.060> yeah<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:44.630> I

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
to say the other thing but um yeah so I

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.230 
to say the other thing but um yeah so I
think<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:46.070> combination<00:05:46.310> of<00:05:46.790> this<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.150> this

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
think the combination of this and this

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.460 
think the combination of this and this
causes<00:05:47.600> this<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.260> make<00:05:48.500> this<00:05:48.650> chip<00:05:49.090> but<00:05:50.090> um

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
causes this to make this chip but um

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.110 
causes this to make this chip but um
really<00:05:51.470> not<00:05:51.620> that<00:05:51.770> bad<00:05:51.980> it's<00:05:52.280> only<00:05:52.520> after<00:05:53.000> like

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
really not that bad it's only after like

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.020 
really not that bad it's only after like
a<00:05:53.150> couple<00:05:53.270> days<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:53.720> it<00:05:53.930> still<00:05:54.169> works<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:55.030> yeah

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030
