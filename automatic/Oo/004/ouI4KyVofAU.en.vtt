moving on sniper rifles shotguns etc but

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.420 
moving on sniper rifles shotguns etc but
because<00:00:22.470> I've<00:00:22.590> got<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.830> nice<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.160> game

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
because I've got this nice little game

plan here team deathmatch using the KSG
12<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.240> nice<00:00:27.359> score<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.900> here

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
12 and I get a really nice score on here

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.490 
12 and I get a really nice score on here
I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.070> gonna<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.550> four<00:00:29.849> deaths<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
I think I gonna get all four deaths and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160 
I think I gonna get all four deaths and
about<00:00:31.669> 26<00:00:32.669> kills<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.660> you'll<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.809> able<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> see

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
about 26 kills but you'll be able to see

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.420 
about 26 kills but you'll be able to see
the<00:00:34.290> outcome<00:00:34.410> without<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> end<00:00:35.040> anyways

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the outcome without at the end anyways

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.209 
the outcome without at the end anyways
but<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.360> shotgun<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.320> extremely<00:00:37.860> powerful

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
but this shotgun it's extremely powerful

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
but this shotgun it's extremely powerful
and<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.420> nice<00:00:39.719> range<00:00:40.050> on

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and it's got some really nice range on

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
and it's got some really nice range on
it<00:00:40.379> as<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.430> accuracy<00:00:41.969> on

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it as you can just see the accuracy on

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
it as you can just see the accuracy on
it<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:43.290> fantastic<00:00:43.770> obviously<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.789> i

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it is not fantastic obviously because i

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.569 
it is not fantastic obviously because i
think<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.899> uses<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> slow<00:00:46.860> ground<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
think this uses a slow ground which is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.920 
think this uses a slow ground which is
slow<00:00:47.969> ground<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> regular

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
slow ground it's not like a regular

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
slow ground it's not like a regular
shotgun<00:00:49.530> well<00:00:49.680> shoot<00:00:50.070> barrage<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.879> pellets

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
shotgun well shoot barrage of pellets

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
shotgun well shoot barrage of pellets
etc<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.410> uses<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.920> singular<00:00:53.280> bullet<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
etc it uses one singular bullet that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.569 
etc it uses one singular bullet that
travels<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.230> longer<00:00:55.530> range<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
travels a lot a lot longer range and it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.889 
travels a lot a lot longer range and it
still<00:00:57.000> holds<00:00:57.180> quite<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.719> damage

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
still holds quite a lot of damage

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
still holds quite a lot of damage
obviously<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.699> accuracy<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.210> not

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
obviously so the accuracy is not

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
obviously so the accuracy is not
fantastic<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.039> using<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.789> long

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
fantastic and when you're using the long

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
fantastic and when you're using the long
barrel<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.199> gun<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.650> absolutely

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
barrel for this gun is absolutely

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
barrel for this gun is absolutely
amazing<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.659> game<00:01:06.869> player<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.350> don't

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
actually think I had the long barrel

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
actually think I had the long barrel
unlocked<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.930> now<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.470> got<00:01:10.650> unlocked

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
would check for that for yourself but

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.210 
would check for that for yourself but
like<00:01:42.810> say<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> shotgun<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.799> absolutely

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
like say the shotgun is absolutely

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.770 
like say the shotgun is absolutely
awesome<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.640> i<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:44.850> recommend<00:01:45.090> using<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
awesome and i don't recommend using it a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
awesome and i don't recommend using it a
few<00:01:46.200> shotgun<00:01:46.590> fans<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
few shotgun fans out there this is a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.219 
few shotgun fans out there this is a
definite<00:01:47.970> must-have<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> huge<00:01:48.899> step<00:01:49.079> up

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
definite must-have it's a huge step up

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
definite must-have it's a huge step up
from<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> modern<00:01:50.399> warfare<00:01:50.549> 3<00:01:50.759> shotguns<00:01:51.329> as

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
from the modern warfare 3 shotguns as

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359 
from the modern warfare 3 shotguns as
they<00:01:51.570> already<00:01:51.750> said<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> lot<00:01:53.220> better

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
they already said and it is a lot better

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
they already said and it is a lot better
than<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> shotguns<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.329> previously<00:01:54.960> unlock

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
than the shotguns you previously unlock

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
than the shotguns you previously unlock
and<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> couple<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.880> issues<00:01:57.000> with

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
wanted to talk about in this commentary

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
different from the modern warfare 3

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.530 
different from the modern warfare 3
counterparts<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.730> are<00:02:11.819> extremely<00:02:12.090> powerful

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
accurate which is something that should

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.059 
accurate which is something that should
definitely<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.970> neft<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.720> mp7<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> fast

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069
