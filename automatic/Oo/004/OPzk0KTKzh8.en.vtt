to each and every click that's what a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.780 
to each and every click that's what a
good<00:01:21.689> servo<00:01:22.080> does<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.009> doesn't<00:01:23.369> respond<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
good servo does if it doesn't respond to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969

each<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> every<00:01:24.509> click<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.900> give<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
each and every click you give or if it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
each and every click you give or if it
starts<00:01:26.280> vibrating<00:01:26.820> around<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> middle

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
starts vibrating around in the middle

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
starts vibrating around in the middle
that<00:01:28.860> means<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.310> servo<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.329> good

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that means your servo is not very good

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.440 
that means your servo is not very good
on<00:01:30.600> resolution<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.820> possibly<00:01:32.820> has<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> problem

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
on resolution and possibly has a problem

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.730 
on resolution and possibly has a problem
at<00:01:33.540> center<00:01:36.110> some<00:01:37.110> servos<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
at center some servos have a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
at center some servos have a
programmable<00:01:38.220> dead-bang<00:01:38.640> capability<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
programmable dead-bang capability and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
programmable dead-bang capability and
this<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.020> adjusted<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> increase<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
this can be adjusted to increase the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609 
this can be adjusted to increase the
resolution<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> servo<00:01:42.259> doing<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.380> test

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
resolution of the servo doing this test

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109 
resolution of the servo doing this test
is<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> great<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> determine<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.939> how

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is a great way to determine just how

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.590 
is a great way to determine just how
good<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.479> servo<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.960> perform<00:01:47.420> if<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
good your servo can perform if you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
good your servo can perform if you
demand<00:01:48.780> performance<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.770> quality<00:01:50.100> from<00:01:50.250> your

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
demand performance and quality from your

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
demand performance and quality from your
servos<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.270> owe<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> yourself<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
servos then you owe it to yourself to

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
servos then you owe it to yourself to
know<00:01:52.259> how<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> test<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.100> servos<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.670> quality

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
know how to test your servos for quality

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.880 
know how to test your servos for quality
and<00:01:54.479> performance<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> those

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and performance this is one of those

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.160 
and performance this is one of those
tests<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> quick<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.909> easy<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.390> 14:1
