00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.400
 to make a good bread is a mixture of art 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.400
 and science 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.380
 in fact a bread is a very product 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.020
 5-4-1 basic Greek flour flour water 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.550
 salt and yeast or an agent 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.020
 fermentation other than yeast 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.360
 flour is a very important element 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.869
 in the manufacture of a payne especially 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.329
 for troubles the first harvests have 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.040
 makes wheat blends 1 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.050
 which can vary according to the harvests 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.550
 from year to year for us 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.020
 allow to have our criteria that we 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 Christians are respected and we 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.230
 make it possible to evolve 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.059
 in the aroma in the sewer in the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.370
 year old dung and jean meyer in 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.699
 year and the fact that the flours are not 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.379
 not chemically enriched asks us 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.390
 to have bakers who can 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 adapt to different interactions 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 or external variant to flour 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.439
 96% of the flours used are 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.470
 wheat flours that come from Quebec 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.940
 Wheat grown in Quebec and 10% are 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.500
 flour from elsewhere in the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.500
 Quebec because we are not cultivated here 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.700
 the blick we use these first 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.770
 harvests and the words read by the mills 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.409
 of relieves to saint-polycarp more so 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.750
 we have a relationship with the miller with 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.490
 the farmer and we baker him so 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.439
 it's a great work of the feet and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 mills of relieves make their wheat 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.430
 their flour available to several 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.020
 bakers and we appreciate without 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.850
 a lot because it's a product 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.799
 which is of very high quality 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.720
 while some other bakeries 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.950
 who do not use the v'lille du quÃ©bec to 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.950
 the great favor of Quebecers 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.490
 in addition to flour that gives taste 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.759
 can there is also an agent of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.340
 fermentation which is leaven then 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.259
 behind each country comes the secret of 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.549
 baker in the art that has him 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:06.310
 master his wine lift this is the side 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.230
 a bit mystical baker is 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.330
 both complex and fragile living 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.120
 leaven is flour and water 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.560
 which naturally fermented the leaven 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.569
 mayor who fermented 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.400
 we call it a chief there is this leader to 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.540
 strength of refreshed every day is going 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.540
 naturally pushed 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 the principle of refreshing the wine is 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.939
 quite simple we get a piece of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 chief 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.090
 in general we get 30 % and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.390
 then we'll add water and 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.390
 flour 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.010
 so I left it 4 to 5 hours to 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.330
 room temperature and then I'm going 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.360
 put it in my room 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.160
 refrigeration until tomorrow so I 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.690
 will evaluate the leaven that has slept all 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.530
 there all night in the fridge 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.530
 so it really has a nice texture 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.590
 lacks a little bit of acidity but 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.590
 I will play the game adapt to that 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.860
 the first harvest has 22 branches 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.630
 we started from the same strain and the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.760
 first the wine so been started at 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.170
 vaudreuil dorion and first 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.780
 harvest was opening a new 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.630
 bakery we imported a leaven and we 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.000
 entrusted to the baker who opened 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.400
 the first night and and we composed 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.990
 like that for 20 years 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.090
 and here I let grow for 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.400
 three hours for a baker the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.800
 Leavening is more complex than 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.900
 through the industrial yeast why 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.520
 because wine is both alive 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.140
 it's both complex and both 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.440
 majine on which to wear a 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.019
 daily attention then the 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.550
 fermentation is slower with a loaf 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.070
 leavened because we do not have yeast 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.540
 industrial inside so ours 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.580
 in fermentation evening it's variable 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 in general the score is okay 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.640
 last three to four hours 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.350
 this is the first fermentation after 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.019
 kneading and the second fermentation 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.660
 will last from two to four hours per 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.060
 compared to a product with yeast the bread 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.100
 leavened will have 7 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.220
 this characteristic of crusts 7 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.660
 particular crispness at the level of 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.910
 Mid nights was a little more 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.760
 elastic we took off a little bit more 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.430
 compact it will also bring a taste and 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.690
 an acidity that we come to 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.220
 recognize us bakers at each 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.100
 once we are dedicated to the consumer 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.139
 this acidity that is developed to 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.430
 through this fermentation there is going 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.860
 allow finally account to maintain 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.410
 bread to freshness at times of 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.490
 more important freshness is what it 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.840
 must be French to do the double 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.200
 take to Quebec because I have the accent 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.200
 French 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.139
 we do not need to be French to 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.639
 make some sourdough bread here at 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.190
 Quebec there are more and more who have 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.650
 favored all that and then by the end of 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.850
 account we have a lot of exchange is in 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.700
 well accounts the French baker 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.830
 who arrives in quebec will listen beautiful 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.180
 the Quebec baker will listen to the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.490
 Italian baker will listen to the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.300
 baker from all walks of life and then 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.830
 with that he will improve his skill 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.540
 in each of our bakeries 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.460
 we are bakers who do not melt 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.260
 all day then stop all 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.479
 weapons and products that come out 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.479
 and that gives it exceptional aromas
