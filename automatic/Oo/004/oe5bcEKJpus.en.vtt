I'm just going to put it back on the
fender<00:00:01.709> pre-sale<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.340> black<00:00:02.550> panel<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.110> show

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
fender pre-sale the black panel and show

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.780 
fender pre-sale the black panel and show
you<00:00:04.170> what<00:00:04.259> all<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.380> built-in<00:00:05.190> effects<00:00:05.460> sound

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
you what all the built-in effects sound

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.830 
you what all the built-in effects sound
like<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.210> start<00:00:06.509> off<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.080> chorus<00:00:08.690> and<00:00:09.690> it

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
like so start off with the chorus and it

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:21.359 
like so start off with the chorus and it
sounds<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.200> this

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.320 

three<00:00:22.369> notes<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:22.910> then<00:00:23.270> move<00:00:23.630> on<00:00:23.779> to<00:00:23.810> flange

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
three notes and then move on to flange

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:39.250 
three notes and then move on to flange
great<00:00:26.330> word<00:00:26.539> flange<00:00:37.360> nice<00:00:38.360> even<00:00:38.780> sweet<00:00:39.019> to<00:00:39.230> a

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
great word flange nice even sweet to a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.040 
great word flange nice even sweet to a
good<00:00:39.650> flange<00:00:39.920> sound<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.640> then<00:00:40.820> phaser<00:00:41.510> which

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
good flange sound and then phaser which

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.810 
good flange sound and then phaser which
you've<00:00:42.290> heard<00:00:42.320> previously<00:00:42.710> sounds<00:00:43.640> really

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
you've heard previously sounds really

00:00:43.820 --> 00:01:12.130 
you've heard previously sounds really
nice<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.180> clean<00:00:44.269> as<00:00:44.540> well<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:11.750> finally

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
nice and clean as well and then finally

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.950 
nice and clean as well and then finally
tremolo<00:01:12.619> can<00:01:13.310> get<00:01:13.520> nice<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.330> subtle<00:01:14.509> whoo

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
tremolo can get nice and subtle whoo

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:26.180 
tremolo can get nice and subtle whoo
insane

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:47.500 

Wow

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.910 

which<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.840> intense<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.470> sounds<00:01:49.740> quite

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
which is a bit intense but sounds quite

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.320 
which is a bit intense but sounds quite
cool<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.550> get<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> realms<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
cool but then you get into the realms of

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.740 
cool but then you get into the realms of
slightly<00:01:51.920> slightly<00:01:52.920> detuned<00:01:53.430> sound<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
slightly slightly detuned sound and that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.020 
slightly slightly detuned sound and that
all<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.440> with<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.850> bit<00:01:56.970> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
all of that was with a little bit of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
all of that was with a little bit of
reverb<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.780> I'll<00:01:57.900> show<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.080> how<00:01:58.260> much

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
reverb on it and I'll show you how much

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.370 
reverb on it and I'll show you how much
reverb<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.780> take<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> effects

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
reverb there is on this take the effects

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.070 
reverb there is on this take the effects
so<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.580> this<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:03.420> I've<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.750> set<00:02:03.930> out

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
so and so this what I've got it set out

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.690 
so and so this what I've got it set out
at<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> moment<00:02:04.500> quite<00:02:04.560> subtle<00:02:07.700> that's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
at the moment quite subtle that's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.499 
at the moment quite subtle that's
awesome

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
awesome

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
awesome
they<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.200> pretty<00:02:10.470> crazy<00:02:11.160> when<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.580> put

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they can get pretty crazy when you put

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.810 
they can get pretty crazy when you put
it<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.910> way<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:17.340> you're<00:02:17.459> playing<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
it all the way up like you're playing in

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
it all the way up like you're playing in
a<00:02:17.880> cave<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.650> same<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> delay<00:02:20.190> can

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
a cave and then the same a delay can

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.699 
a cave and then the same a delay can
start<00:02:20.700> from<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.090> quite<00:02:21.390> sort<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.230> slap<00:02:22.500> back

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
start from like quite sort of slap back

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:33.500 
start from like quite sort of slap back
sort<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.070> sound<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.640> then<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.820> will<00:02:33.360> either

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
sort of sound and then you will either

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:48.869 
sort of sound and then you will either
delay

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.539 

which<00:02:49.879> is<00:02:50.030> really<00:02:50.209> nice<00:02:50.390> out<00:02:50.659> so<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.769> for<00:02:52.400> an

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
which is really nice out so and for an

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.240 
which is really nice out so and for an
amplifier<00:02:52.790> costs<00:02:53.689> under<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.530> hundred<00:02:54.739> pounds

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
amplifier costs under a hundred pounds

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.850 
amplifier costs under a hundred pounds
you<00:02:56.030> can't<00:02:56.510> go<00:02:56.659> wrong<00:02:56.810> with<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:57.290> got<00:02:57.530> so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
you can't go wrong with it it's got so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.940 
you can't go wrong with it it's got so
many<00:02:58.010> features<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.870> Kazem<00:02:59.870> amp<00:03:00.530> models

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
many features in the Kazem amp models

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.100 
many features in the Kazem amp models
sound<00:03:01.220> great<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:02.090> effects<00:03:02.450> sound<00:03:02.780> really

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
sound great the effects sound really

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.710 
sound great the effects sound really
good<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.940> just<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.209> really<00:03:05.390> great<00:03:05.599> little

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
good and it's just a really great little

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.059 
good and it's just a really great little
app<00:03:05.930> but<00:03:06.200> I've<00:03:06.290> had<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.560> for<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> number<00:03:06.860> of

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
app but I've had it for a number of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.890 
app but I've had it for a number of
years<00:03:07.310> now<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.790> it's<00:03:08.420> great<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.690> practice

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
years now and it's great to practice

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.860 
years now and it's great to practice
when<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.349> can't<00:03:09.760> turn<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.940> igniter<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.510> because

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
when I can't turn the igniter on because

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.030 
when I can't turn the igniter on because
it<00:03:12.470> makes<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.190> ground<00:03:13.489> shake<00:03:13.879> but<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.950> a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
it makes the ground shake but it's a

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.649 
it makes the ground shake but it's a
really<00:03:16.220> cool<00:03:16.310> little<00:03:16.489> amplifier<00:03:16.909> as<00:03:17.359> I<00:03:17.390> said

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
really cool little amplifier as I said

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.170 
really cool little amplifier as I said
under<00:03:17.810> 100<00:03:18.349> quid<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.769> they've<00:03:19.459> got<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> various

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
under 100 quid and they've got a various

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.449 
under 100 quid and they've got a various
range<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:21.140> amplifiers<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.890> cube<00:03:22.190> range

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
range of amplifiers in the cube range

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.699 
range of amplifiers in the cube range
which<00:03:22.909> have<00:03:23.150> more<00:03:23.420> speakers<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.349> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
which have more speakers so that the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.309 
which have more speakers so that the
speech<00:03:25.159> doesn't<00:03:25.370> break<00:03:25.609> up<00:03:25.849> as<00:03:25.970> much<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.450> I

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
speech doesn't break up as much and I

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.500 
speech doesn't break up as much and I
have<00:03:27.530> more<00:03:27.769> features<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.579> can<00:03:28.909> being<00:03:29.239> able<00:03:29.389> to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
have more features I can being able to

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.509 
have more features I can being able to
