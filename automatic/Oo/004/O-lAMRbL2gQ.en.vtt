00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 very good guys welcome a new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.819
 video in excavations of the solution to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.950
 problem of the button and the playstation 4 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.970
 that expels us the you to me has 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.160
 last the truth that scared me enough 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.200
 and the solution is the following you remove the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.150
 rubber that behind that under the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 eject the discs button as is a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.789
 brush small brush that is already 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 used and there is not no need for it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 cleanliness and well give it strong you have to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.330
 clean the eject button correctly 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 discs and the power button then 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.619
 country a cloth likewise the ibis 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 cleaning below by the button by 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 inside everything as much as they can clean 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.380
 that button that surely is for the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
 dirt for what happens now we keep 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.670
 a while the button the finger on the button 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 so that it expels the energy that it contains 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.649
 the button we keep there the finger as 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 You see in the video how I am 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 maintaining and once maintained then what 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 that we have to catch tape tape 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.430
 black valcke rubber insulation nice 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.500
 because if you take an insulating tape 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 white and your console has reached 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.980
 to fall a little uglier and if we do not go and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 our console is white so put 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.000
 interesting white is worth it there we go 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 to put a little piece of tape in the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.179
 console cost me a little bit to take out 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.100
 this little thing there we see how she cut a 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:13.399
 typical one strip of insulating tape 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 black and the problem with this is 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.000
 practically for society and with this 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.479
 is going to solve the problem 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.399
 definitive and good if you have when 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 when you expose that problem if you have 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.849
 pulled the cord and not straight in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.039
 the cable as it could damage your 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.780
 good console if we put on the tape 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.969
 insulator and would already be practically already 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 everything would be perfect only now 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.060
 keep 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 let's go how it looks is not noticeable almost 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 from the tape 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.330
 and it's pretty soft now 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.280
 we keep the button finger on 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.320
 all this is with the console disconnected 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.400
 ok we keep it in a little bit 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.920
 so that the dirt is removed and good that 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.270
 it's okay it likes to comment 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 and to other areas
