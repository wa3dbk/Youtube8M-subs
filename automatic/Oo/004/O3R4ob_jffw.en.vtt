00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
pressure on edge was that's going to do

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.630 
pressure on edge was that's going to do
is<00:02:59.780> collapse<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.320> pocket<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.860> kind<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.400> box

is collapse the pocket and kind of box

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.040 
is collapse the pocket and kind of box
