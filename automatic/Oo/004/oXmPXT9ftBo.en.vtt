or two people have asked me how I keep

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.210 
or two people have asked me how I keep
the<00:02:34.540> figure<00:02:34.900> standing<00:02:36.630> well<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.950> want<00:02:39.130> to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
the figure standing well you want to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.600 
the figure standing well you want to
know<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.459> secret<00:02:41.160> nothing<00:02:42.160> there's<00:02:42.520> nothing

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
know the secret nothing there's nothing

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.360 
know the secret nothing there's nothing
around<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.480> nothing<00:02:44.020> above<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.530> nothing<00:02:45.220> to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
around it nothing above it nothing to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.420 
around it nothing above it nothing to
the<00:02:45.489> side<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.320> what's<00:02:47.320> on<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.530> bottom<00:02:48.570> shoe

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.229 

therefore<00:02:54.469> there<00:02:55.469> is<00:02:55.650> nothing<00:02:56.120> helping<00:02:57.120> these

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
therefore there is nothing helping these

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:05.210 
therefore there is nothing helping these
figures<00:02:57.599> stand<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:58.219> same<00:02:59.219> with<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.549> one

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.040 

yeah<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.980> real<00:03:08.190> reason<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.050> most

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
yeah so the real reason is because most

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.200 
yeah so the real reason is because most
sonics<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.130> buy<00:03:11.340> their<00:03:11.730> three<00:03:12.090> inch

sonics that you buy their three inch

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.990 
sonics that you buy their three inch
