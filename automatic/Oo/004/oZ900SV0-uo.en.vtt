fastest and easiest way to gain dark

elixir<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> clash<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> clans<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
elixir in all of clash of clans and I

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.019 
elixir in all of clash of clans and I
definitely<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.860> this<00:00:26.100> method<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.790> think

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
definitely back up this method and think

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
definitely back up this method and think
it<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> best<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.290> am<00:00:28.500> currently

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it is the best because I am currently

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.310 
it is the best because I am currently
upgrading<00:00:29.220> my<00:00:29.610> art<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> Queens<00:00:30.480> level<00:00:30.570> 4<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
upgrading my art to Queens level 4 and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.979 
upgrading my art to Queens level 4 and
that<00:00:31.890> cost<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.310> about<00:00:32.660> 27,000<00:00:33.660> dark<00:00:33.810> elixir

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that cost me about 27,000 dark elixir

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
that cost me about 27,000 dark elixir
now<00:00:34.590> keep<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.890> mind<00:00:34.950> before<00:00:35.400> I<00:00:35.670> started<00:00:36.120> this

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
now keep in mind before I started this

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.450 
now keep in mind before I started this
upgrade<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> had<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.079> 3,000<00:00:37.800> dark<00:00:37.950> elixir<00:00:38.100> in

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
upgrade I had about 3,000 dark elixir in

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.240 
upgrade I had about 3,000 dark elixir in
my<00:00:38.670> storage<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> whole<00:00:40.410> day<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:41.100> able

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
my storage and in a whole day I was able

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.979 
my storage and in a whole day I was able
to<00:00:41.489> gain<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.540> bit<00:00:42.720> more

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to gain all that and a little bit more

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.050 
to gain all that and a little bit more
just<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> method<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.730> super

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
just off of this method and it's super

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.060 
just off of this method and it's super
easy<00:00:45.090> super<00:00:45.480> fast<00:00:45.899> doesn't<00:00:46.470> cost<00:00:46.710> really

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
easy super fast doesn't cost really

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
easy super fast doesn't cost really
anything<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.570> overall<00:00:49.050> awesome

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
anything and it's just overall awesome

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.979 
anything and it's just overall awesome
so<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.730> method<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.449> about<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so what this method is all about is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.080 
so what this method is all about is
you're<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.620> looking<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.129> bases<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you're really looking for bases on the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.869 
you're really looking for bases on the
outside<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.809> their<00:00:54.960> dark<00:00:55.140> elixir<00:00:55.320> drills

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
outside with their dark elixir drills

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.220 
outside with their dark elixir drills
most<00:00:56.879> bases<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:58.019> on<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
most bases are going to have them on the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
most bases are going to have them on the
outside<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.769> that<00:00:58.800> makes<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.280> easy<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
outside so that makes it really easy to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.759 
outside so that makes it really easy to
get<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> D<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.589> like

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
get the D because you know we all like

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.619 
get the D because you know we all like
getting<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> D<00:01:02.339> uh-huh<00:01:02.850> uh-huh<00:01:03.269> no<00:01:03.539> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
getting the D uh-huh uh-huh no I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
getting the D uh-huh uh-huh no I'm
saying<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.140> same<00:01:04.410> guys<00:01:04.620> uh-huh<00:01:05.040> but

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
saying you know same guys uh-huh but

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
saying you know same guys uh-huh but
yeah<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.850> basically<00:01:06.480> what<00:01:06.870> army<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.320> have

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
yeah so basically what army we have

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
yeah so basically what army we have
trained<00:01:07.800> up<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.340> method<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.450> are

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
trained up for this method is we are

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
trained up for this method is we are
going<00:01:09.660> to<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.870> using<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.620> goblins<00:01:11.250> as

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
going to be using a lot of goblins as

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730 
going to be using a lot of goblins as
well<00:01:11.730> as<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> giants<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.440> too<00:01:13.620> many

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
well as a lot of giants not too many

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
well as a lot of giants not too many
Giants<00:01:14.190> they're<00:01:14.340> basically<00:01:14.640> they're<00:01:14.909> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
Giants they're basically they're just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510 
Giants they're basically they're just
for<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.390> distraction<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> set<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.490> my

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
for the distraction so how I set up my

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
for the distraction so how I set up my
barracks<00:01:18.210> training<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> did<00:01:19.380> Giants

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
barracks training is I did Giants

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.610

to be training with goblins I also threw
in<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:27.060> heal<00:01:27.270> spells<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.020> obviously

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in some heal spells because obviously

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.840 
in some heal spells because obviously
when<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.980> up<00:01:29.160> against<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.580> kind<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
when you go up against these kind of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
when you go up against these kind of
bases<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.510> going<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.780> wizard

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
bases there are going to be wizard

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.990 
bases there are going to be wizard
towers<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> mortars<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:32.850> want

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
towers and mortars and you don't want

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520 
towers and mortars and you don't want
your<00:01:33.090> gob<00:01:33.300> is<00:01:33.480> dying<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.320> kind<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
your gob is dying out so it's kind of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.320 
your gob is dying out so it's kind of
nice<00:01:34.650> sometimes<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.370> clutch<00:01:35.610> situation<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
nice sometimes in a clutch situation to

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.670 
nice sometimes in a clutch situation to
have<00:01:36.450> those<00:01:36.630> heal<00:01:36.810> spells<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.230> help<00:01:37.410> you<00:01:37.500> out

now<00:01:57.330> obviously<00:01:57.720> what<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.770> method<00:01:58.980> is<00:01:59.280> all

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
now obviously what this method is all

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.340 
now obviously what this method is all
about<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.720> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.900> do<00:02:01.110> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350

you're going to gain a lot of trophies

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.910 
you're going to gain a lot of trophies
so<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> gain<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.620> of<00:02:04.740> trophies

and that is either through town hall

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.080 
and that is either through town hall
sniping<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.710> whatever<00:02:08.099> method<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.550> find<00:02:08.849> best

sniping or whatever method you find best
and<00:02:09.390> you're<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.560> ahead<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and you're going to go ahead and just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.089 
and you're going to go ahead and just
lose<00:02:11.459> every<00:02:11.910> single<00:02:12.030> battle<00:02:12.510> um<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.980> that

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
lose every single battle um I know that

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.860 
lose every single battle um I know that
sounds<00:02:14.489> kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> stupid<00:02:14.910> obviously<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
sounds kind of stupid obviously you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
sounds kind of stupid obviously you
don't<00:02:16.019> have<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.410> lose<00:02:16.530> every<00:02:16.739> single<00:02:16.890> battle

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
don't have to lose every single battle

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.220 
don't have to lose every single battle
but<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.730> fastest<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.780> way<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.959> can

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
but it is fastest and the way you can

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
but it is fastest and the way you can
train<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.530> army<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.890> fastest<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.209> what<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.420> go

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
train your army the fastest so what I go

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.970 
train your army the fastest so what I go
ahead<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.379> look<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.560> these<00:02:22.740> spaces

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
ahead and do is look for these spaces

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.530 
ahead and do is look for these spaces
that<00:02:23.280> are<00:02:23.340> pretty<00:02:23.490> much<00:02:23.670> abandoned

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
that are pretty much abandoned

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.630 
that are pretty much abandoned
and<00:02:24.659> they<00:02:25.319> become<00:02:25.739> really<00:02:26.069> easy<00:02:26.219> to<00:02:26.430> find

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and they become really easy to find

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
and they become really easy to find
because<00:02:26.879> if<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.390> guys<00:02:27.540> didn't<00:02:27.900> already<00:02:28.049> know

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
because if you guys didn't already know

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.709 
because if you guys didn't already know
the<00:02:29.069> more<00:02:29.250> battles<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.760> lose<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.359> more<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
the more battles you lose the more it

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.720 
the more battles you lose the more it
matches<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.260> against<00:02:31.650> basis<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.459> lost

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
matches you against basis that have lost

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.819 
matches you against basis that have lost
previously<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:33.569> obviously<00:02:34.200> bases<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.799> are

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
previously and obviously bases that are

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.559 
previously and obviously bases that are
abandoned<00:02:35.459> are<00:02:35.609> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.849> have<00:02:35.969> a<00:02:36.000> huge<00:02:36.329> loss

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
abandoned are going to have a huge loss

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.420 
abandoned are going to have a huge loss
ratio<00:02:37.109> and<00:02:37.379> it's<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.099> be<00:02:38.189> really<00:02:38.340> easy

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
ratio and it's going to be really easy

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.610 
ratio and it's going to be really easy
to<00:02:38.730> find<00:02:38.909> these<00:02:39.090> resources<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.379> I<00:02:40.409> go

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
to find these resources so what I go

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.380 
to find these resources so what I go
ahead<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.609> this<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:41.909> is<00:02:42.060> dropped<00:02:42.299> on

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
ahead and do and this one is dropped on

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.179 
ahead and do and this one is dropped on
my<00:02:42.510> Giants<00:02:42.840> first<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:43.709> followed<00:02:44.069> up

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
my Giants first and then followed up

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.440 
my Giants first and then followed up

right now all right there you go got 400
dark<00:04:51.139> elixir<00:04:51.380> now<00:04:51.710> wasn't<00:04:51.949> that<00:04:52.069> much<00:04:52.370> but

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
dark elixir now wasn't that much but

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.279 
dark elixir now wasn't that much but
obviously<00:04:53.030> once<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.750> get<00:04:53.900> up<00:04:54.020> into<00:04:54.169> the

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
obviously once you get up into the

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.960 
obviously once you get up into the
higher<00:04:54.470> leagues<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.949> does<00:04:55.130> get<00:04:55.430> better<00:04:55.639> and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
higher leagues it does get better and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.089 
higher leagues it does get better and
better<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.750> higher<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.169> push<00:04:57.410> up<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.949> the

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
better so the higher you push up and the

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.770 
better so the higher you push up and the
faster<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.639> drop<00:04:58.880> down<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.270> more<00:04:59.449> you<00:04:59.630> will

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
faster you drop down the more you will

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.200 
faster you drop down the more you will

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
about 500 dark elixir now that would

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.689 
about 500 dark elixir now that would
take<00:05:09.259> actually<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.740> couple<00:05:09.979> of<00:05:10.039> hours<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.520> gain
