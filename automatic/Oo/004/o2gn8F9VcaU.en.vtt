00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:21.529
 my name is riccardo brigna I am 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.680
 winemaker and I'm in charge of supervision 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.980
 wine cellar technique tollo from 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.509
 2003 harvest here for almost ten years 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.330
 precisely the cellar where we are at 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.440
 tollo in the province of chieti 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.449
 among the controls the massif of the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.790
 majella and the qom adriana in an area 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:50.870
 particularly suited from the point of 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:53.660
 viticultural and oenological view of the cellar 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.100
 tollo is therefore a cooperative 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.559
 social cellar brings together about 850 members 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.539
 a little throughout the abruzzo and also in 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.550
 small part even a little outside the region 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:10.399
 in the Molise and in Puglia and produces precisely 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.830
 wine from the early sixties from 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.550
 when it was founded and then it was one 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.189
 continuous growth of success volumes 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.380
 both from a commercial point of view and 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.970
 of grateful sight 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.810
 of criticism and national competitions 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.810
 and international 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.579
 from the 2008 harvest the ministry of 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.399
 culture recognized us as an ad hoc 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.810
 precisely for the municipality of tollo for i 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.750
 vineyards starting from the communities 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.280
 clearly an exceptional factor you can 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.770
 well understand that the recognition of a 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 dock is given to zones only 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.840
 particularly suited 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.560
 what I want to emphasize is 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.500
 just the project together that the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.330
 project that the Italian cup makes in 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.729
 different Italian regions to select 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.890
 the best of wine production a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.470
 national level for several reasons 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.840
 we are really proud of Abruzzo 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.060
 knowing in short, in standards that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.490
 cooked wants to guarantee its customers 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.280
 having been selected to produce it 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.100
 one of the two wines is strictly indigenous 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.709
 and also original in the composition which 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.530
 is a wine made from a blend between 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.030
 pecorino then a white wine removed 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.510
 owns it and in the same way the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.840
 cococciola that another vine 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.870
 strictly strictly Abruzzo white of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.409
 this is another the other wine is a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.750
 rosato is a cherry 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.060
 both are clearly guaranteed both 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.090
 from the traceability and to the systems of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.310
 quality that in the cellar I close to the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.069
 more advanced certifications that are there 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.609
 national level and more clearly 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.549
 all the supply chain checks are added 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.500
 and the traceability that there is too much 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.909
 requires to guarantee the maximum to the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.230
 quality to its consumers on 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.230
 branded products
