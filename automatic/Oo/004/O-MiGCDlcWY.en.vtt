does well and when it doesn't it doesn't
so<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.469> guess<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.059> Newton<00:00:39.059> didn't

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so you know guess what Newton didn't

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.619 
so you know guess what Newton didn't
succeed<00:00:39.930> Apple<00:00:40.829> 3<00:00:41.100> did<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> succeed<00:00:41.879> Lisa

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
succeed Apple 3 did it succeed Lisa

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.380 
succeed Apple 3 did it succeed Lisa
didn't<00:00:43.230> succeed<00:00:44.059> Macintosh<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
didn't succeed Macintosh was the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.470 
didn't succeed Macintosh was the
mega-hit<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.700> what<00:00:47.700> was<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.910> first<00:00:48.270> company

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
mega-hit but what was the first company

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.410 
mega-hit but what was the first company
that<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.140> made<00:00:49.620> cd-rom<00:00:50.460> drives<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.120> every

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that really made cd-rom drives on every

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
that really made cd-rom drives on every
computer<00:00:51.860> guess<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.850> Apple

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
computer guess what it was Apple

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.770 
computer guess what it was Apple
guess<00:00:56.129> who<00:00:56.399> democratized<00:00:57.289> 802<00:00:58.289> 11<00:00:59.780> airport

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
guess who democratized 802 11 airport

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
guess who democratized 802 11 airport
and<00:01:00.989> half<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.839> so<00:01:04.769> how<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.400> firewire

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and half right and so how about firewire

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.580 
and half right and so how about firewire
who<00:01:06.509> made<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.020> standard<00:01:07.440> how<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.340> USB

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
who made that a standard how about USB

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
who made that a standard how about USB
so<00:01:10.590> after<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> while<00:01:11.190> it's<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.149> bigot

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
revolutions were caused by little

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.060 
revolutions were caused by little
uprisings<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.210> Apple's<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.200> made<00:01:19.680> me

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
but you know what part didn't make it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
but you know what part didn't make it
commercial<00:01:28.890> success<00:01:29.340> after<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.360> doesn't<00:01:31.280> one

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
commercial success after it doesn't one

thing you always have to say is how come
nobody<00:01:35.009> else<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.429> this<00:01:35.610> before<00:01:35.819> right

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
nobody else did this before right

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410 
nobody else did this before right
there's<00:01:37.380> nothing<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.920> mythical<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:39.149> the

there's nothing like mythical about the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.279 
there's nothing like mythical about the
ipod<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.280> wheel<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.479> anybody<00:01:43.080> could

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
ipod and the wheel right anybody could

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.520 
ipod and the wheel right anybody could
have<00:01:43.319> done<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.340> once<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.569> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have done that so once you think that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.020 
have done that so once you think that
some<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.009> computer<00:01:47.460> companies<00:01:47.880> would

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
some of these computer companies would

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.660 
some of these computer companies would
say<00:01:48.240> AHA<00:01:48.690> Apple<00:01:49.590> does<00:01:49.800> well<00:01:50.039> because<00:01:50.429> it<00:01:50.550> is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
say AHA Apple does well because it is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.720 
say AHA Apple does well because it is
beautiful<00:01:51.240> products

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
beautiful products

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.300

so<00:01:53.270> how<00:01:53.480> much<00:01:53.510> could<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.140> most<00:01:54.650> expensive

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
so how much could the most expensive

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.570 
so how much could the most expensive
industrial<00:01:56.210> designer<00:01:56.600> in<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.870> world<00:01:56.960> costs<00:01:59.290> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
industrial designer in the world costs a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.220 
industrial designer in the world costs a
million<00:02:01.580> dollars<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.030> year<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:02.390> our<00:02:02.630> two

that I guess in a sense it proves the
point<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.920> these<00:02:22.460> people<00:02:22.790> don't<00:02:23.000> know<00:02:23.150> what

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
point that these people don't know what

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.510 
point that these people don't know what
to<00:02:23.630> steal<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:25.310> don't<00:02:25.640> know<00:02:25.790> what<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.120> steal

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:39.920 

I<00:02:36.860> cannot<00:02:37.860> explain<00:02:38.250> how<00:02:38.490> Steve<00:02:39.270> comes<00:02:39.570> up<00:02:39.750> with

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
I cannot explain how Steve comes up with

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.270 
I cannot explain how Steve comes up with
these<00:02:40.050> things<00:02:40.110> because<00:02:40.470> he<00:02:40.710> has<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> different

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
these things because he has a different

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.940 
these things because he has a different
operating<00:02:41.580> system<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.930> mere<00:02:43.290> mortals<00:02:43.680> cannot

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
operating system so mere mortals cannot

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.070 
operating system so mere mortals cannot
understand<00:02:44.520> him<00:02:44.750> that's<00:02:45.750> why<00:02:45.870> when<00:02:46.050> people

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
understand him that's why when people

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.720 
understand him that's why when people
try<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.440> understand<00:02:46.950> him<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.460> know<00:02:47.580> his

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
try to understand him and you know his

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.310 
try to understand him and you know his
quirks<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.300> all<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:49.020> get<00:02:49.110> very

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
quirks and all that you get very

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.890 
quirks and all that you get very
frustrated<00:02:49.590> because<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.790> can't<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.720> be

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
frustrated because you can't it would be

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.820 
frustrated because you can't it would be
like<00:02:52.080> telling<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:53.010> fish<00:02:53.780> how<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:55.230> understand

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
like telling a fish how to understand
