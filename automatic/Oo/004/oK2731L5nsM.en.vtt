00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.620

 completely without him and I want to tell you 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.400

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.520
 disease there is a solution that I want 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.760
 Tell her two little friends of mine 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.850
 little they came out with well breast cancer 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.979
 lamentable sad in my heart I 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.340
 It is small where the weight hurt 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.229
 when I found out because then the cancer 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.840

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.330
 so many lives and we would like it to appear 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.730

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.590
 thanks to god a little bit ago 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.390
 I found the note and 6 gives the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.150
 coincidence that both in the same week 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.490

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.950

 since he was already laughing, you know why 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.120
