iris<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.660> which<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.809> cool<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.170> we

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
iris and in which was cool because we

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
iris and in which was cool because we
got<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> lot<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> scenes<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.280> animating

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
got to see a lot of scenes for animating

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.040 
got to see a lot of scenes for animating
but<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.899> terms

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
but there's really not too much in terms

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
but there's really not too much in terms
I<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> memorization<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
I like I like the memorization and I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
I like I like the memorization and I
like<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.809> much<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> references<00:01:02.129> almost<00:01:02.460> every

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
like how much it references almost every

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.810 
like how much it references almost every
region<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.420> Pokemon<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.979> every<00:01:05.430> region<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
region of Pokemon like every region it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.920 
region of Pokemon like every region it
goes<00:01:05.939> through<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.570> their<00:01:06.689> entire

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
goes through all that their entire

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
goes through all that their entire
history<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.280> cool<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
history which was cool because the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.760 
history which was cool because the
Pokemon<00:01:09.450> doesn't<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.810> reanimate<00:01:10.439> scenes

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
Pokemon doesn't really reanimate scenes

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010 
Pokemon doesn't really reanimate scenes
so<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> fact<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> reanimated<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> was

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so the fact that it reanimated that was

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
so the fact that it reanimated that was
awesome<00:01:13.380> even<00:01:13.619> reanimated<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> douchebag

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
awesome even reanimated the douchebag

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.020 
awesome even reanimated the douchebag

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that was named Damian or something who

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
that was named Damian or something who
originally<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.110> original<00:01:19.590> charmander's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
originally was original charmander's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
originally was original charmander's
trainer<00:01:20.820> even<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> stuff<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.290> or

dactyl<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
dactyl all that kind it's kind of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.749 
dactyl all that kind it's kind of
nostalgic<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.380> us<00:01:25.530> fans<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.369> grew<00:01:26.640> up

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
nostalgic for us fans because we grew up

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.060 
nostalgic for us fans because we grew up
watching<00:01:26.970> those<00:01:27.299> seasons<00:01:27.840> any<00:01:28.110> any<00:01:28.619> Pokemon

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
watching those seasons any any Pokemon

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
watching those seasons any any Pokemon
fan<00:01:29.280> recognizes<00:01:29.970> those<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.420> least<00:01:30.570> those<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
fan recognizes those at least those the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410 
fan recognizes those at least those the
first<00:01:31.320> half<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> those<00:01:31.770> flashbacks<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.700> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
first half of those flashbacks and it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
first half of those flashbacks and it's
just<00:01:33.600> cool<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.200> revisit<00:01:34.560> them<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
just cool to kind of revisit them and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.179 
just cool to kind of revisit them and
then<00:01:35.640> obviously<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.119> second<00:01:36.450> half<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:37.189> them

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
then obviously the second half is them

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.039 
then obviously the second half is them
transferring<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.360> way<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.720> did<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
transferring over the way they did it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
transferring over the way they did it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
Bucky it was just like it's like is not

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
Bucky it was just like it's like is not
even<00:01:46.530> necessarily<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.270> also<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> way

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
even necessarily that also with the way

the<00:01:48.750> Japanese<00:01:48.990> when<00:01:49.860> he<00:01:49.979> left<00:01:50.159> Charles<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the Japanese when he left Charles and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
the Japanese when he left Charles and
apparently<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.479> wanted<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> strong

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
apparently was like I wanted a strong

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
apparently was like I wanted a strong
Charles<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> weak<00:01:53.759> Charizard

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
Charles I don't want a weak Charizard

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
Charles I don't want a weak Charizard
which<00:01:54.390> makes<00:01:54.600> ash<00:01:54.780> seem<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.259> dick<00:01:55.470> even

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
which makes ash seem like a dick even

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
which makes ash seem like a dick even
though<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.100> he's<00:01:56.280> doing<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.969> make

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
though you know he's doing that to make

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.139 
though you know he's doing that to make
it<00:01:57.750> easier<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> Charizard<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.399> let<00:01:59.579> him<00:01:59.670> go

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it easier for a Charizard to let him go

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.819
