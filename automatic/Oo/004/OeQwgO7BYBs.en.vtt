00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.870

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.660
 before embarking on her cap we 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.489
 work with hair 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.250
 you will need a foam to fix 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.760
 apply the product at the roots and dry 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.190
 hair with a comb for a fleece 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.940
 separate the front strands from the rest 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 hair 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.070
 secure them with hairpins and then with 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.160

 donut for hair 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.780
 distribute hair so that it is not 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.940
 it was visible the second gum stretch 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.190
 over donut remaining hair we 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.320
 twist around the beam and fasten 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.330
 invisible 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.560
 now we release the two front strands 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.560
 and do a pile at the roots 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.830
 after which we fix 5 on the back of our head 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.119
