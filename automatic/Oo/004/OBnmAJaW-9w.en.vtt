00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
would completely cut away from him but I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.160 
would completely cut away from him but I
knew<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.730> wouldn't<00:00:21.180> show<00:00:21.359> too<00:00:21.420> much<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.080> it

knew it wouldn't show too much and it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
knew it wouldn't show too much and it
didn't<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.039> did<00:00:23.250> actually<00:00:23.430> find<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:24.029> the

like no attack them and that's exactly

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
like no attack them and that's exactly

what can Bochy did he's like shut up its

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469 
what can Bochy did he's like shut up its
rips<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.220> throw<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
rips or throw it out but what do you

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.289 
rips or throw it out but what do you
think<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.049> question<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.939> like<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.149> could

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
think the question was like what could

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330 
think the question was like what could
that<00:01:45.360> power<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.159> only

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that power be I don't know the only

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.530 
that power be I don't know the only
thing<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> could<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> makes<00:01:48.360> them

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
thing I could think of was it makes them

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
thing I could think of was it makes them
question<00:01:49.079> everything<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.710> should<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> swing

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
question everything like should I swing

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
question everything like should I swing
my<00:01:50.820> sword<00:01:50.970> should<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> step<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.500> that's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
my sword should I take a step but that's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.710 
my sword should I take a step but that's
too<00:01:52.860> similar<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.520> fear<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> don't<00:01:54.509> know

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
too similar to the fear so I don't know

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.280 
too similar to the fear so I don't know
and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.130> yourself<00:01:56.640> Lloyd<00:01:57.210> Lloyd<00:01:57.630> could

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and then the yourself Lloyd Lloyd could

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
and then the yourself Lloyd Lloyd could
transform<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.310> whoever<00:01:59.579> he<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.820> fighting<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
transform and whoever he was fighting so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.870 
transform and whoever he was fighting so
he<00:02:00.360> transformed<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.960> kampachi<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.880> that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
he transformed in kampachi and that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 
he transformed in kampachi and that
wasn't<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.270> problem<00:02:03.509> he<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.049> cut<00:02:04.740> himself

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
wasn't a problem he just cut himself

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.459 
wasn't a problem he just cut himself
down<00:02:05.250> he<00:02:05.909> gets<00:02:06.450> injured<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.960> he<00:02:07.110> probably

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
down he gets injured all he probably

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.550 
down he gets injured all he probably
cuts<00:02:07.829> himself<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.310> his<00:02:08.429> spare<00:02:08.670> time<00:02:08.729> obviously

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
cuts himself in his spare time obviously

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.650 
cuts himself in his spare time obviously
not<00:02:10.560> obviously<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.280> probably<00:02:12.239> does<00:02:12.450> I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
not obviously but probably does I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.790 
not obviously but probably does I
wouldn't<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.989> surprised

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
wouldn't be surprised

wouldn't be surprised
so<00:02:13.980> yeah<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.490> beat<00:02:14.820> him<00:02:14.850> easily<00:02:15.210> so

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
so yeah he just beat him easily so

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.680 
so yeah he just beat him easily so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
have time to let them decide he's going

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.400 
have time to let them decide he's going
to<00:02:27.210> fight<00:02:27.330> him<00:02:27.360> he<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.750> goes<00:02:27.870> straight<00:02:28.050> for

explosion or a big rubble dust explosion
or<00:02:36.420> something<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.290> Kenpachi<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.310> gonna

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
or something but Kenpachi is not gonna
be<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.760> guy<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.390> obvious<00:02:39.780> he's<00:02:39.930> probably

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
be this guy it's obvious he's probably

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.510 
be this guy it's obvious he's probably
not<00:02:40.290> really<00:02:40.530> gonna<00:02:40.650> stand<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.040> chance<00:02:41.070> he<00:02:41.490> might

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
not really gonna stand a chance he might

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.030 
not really gonna stand a chance he might
do<00:02:41.820> okay<00:02:42.390> ish<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.020> while<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:43.530> he's

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
do okay ish for a little while but he's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.320 
do okay ish for a little while but he's
not<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.340> able<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.610> beat<00:02:44.730> him<00:02:44.880> he<00:02:45.000> did

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
not gonna be able to beat him he did

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.640 
not gonna be able to beat him he did
block<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.750> with<00:02:45.810> his<00:02:45.930> arm<00:02:46.080> after<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.470> don't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
block it with his arm after I don't

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.870 
block it with his arm after I don't
think<00:02:46.770> he's<00:02:46.860> gonna<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.100> his<00:02:47.220> arm<00:02:47.310> cut<00:02:47.490> off<00:02:47.520> he

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
think he's gonna get his arm cut off he

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.670 
think he's gonna get his arm cut off he
probably<00:02:48.120> will<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.450> mean<00:02:48.750> obviously<00:02:49.260> he's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
probably will I mean obviously he's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080 
probably will I mean obviously he's
going<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> get<00:02:50.070> his<00:02:50.190> arm<00:02:50.310> cut<00:02:50.490> off<00:02:50.520> at<00:02:50.820> some

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
going to get his arm cut off at some

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.490 
going to get his arm cut off at some
point<00:02:51.360> or<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> series<00:02:52.020> might<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.260> well<00:02:52.410> get

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
point or in the series might as well get

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.750 
point or in the series might as well get
it<00:02:52.560> over<00:02:52.770> with<00:02:53.430> right<00:02:53.730> now<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:55.100> anyway<00:02:56.100> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it over with right now so anyway that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.150 
it over with right now so anyway that
guy<00:02:56.940> he<00:02:57.330> wasn't<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.810> bear<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:58.380> anything<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.980> ape

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
guy he wasn't a bear or anything the ape

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.440 
guy he wasn't a bear or anything the ape
was<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.610> part<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.820> his<00:02:59.940> power<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.360> if

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
was just part of his power and if

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.550 
was just part of his power and if
someone<00:03:00.630> said<00:03:00.900> they<00:03:01.050> thought<00:03:01.080> he<00:03:01.320> might<00:03:01.470> have

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
someone said they thought he might have

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.470 
someone said they thought he might have
been<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.250> same<00:03:02.430> race<00:03:02.700> as<00:03:02.730> kuma<00:03:03.270> murah

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
been like the same race as kuma murah

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.910 
been like the same race as kuma murah
komamura<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:04.920> no<00:03:05.130> he<00:03:05.580> could<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.030> roar<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
komamura but no he could just roar and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.950 
komamura but no he could just roar and
then<00:03:08.250> Ichigo<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.850> sense<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> Ray<00:03:09.420> OPSEU<00:03:09.780> from

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960

stronger<00:04:40.430> that's<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.610> would<00:04:41.760> do<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.210> mean

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
stronger that's what I would do I mean

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.500 
stronger that's what I would do I mean
it's<00:04:43.050> not<00:04:43.169> very<00:04:43.260> nice<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.710> hands<00:04:44.040> but<00:04:44.220> hey

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
it's not very nice to the hands but hey

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.850 
it's not very nice to the hands but hey
make<00:04:45.510> sense<00:04:45.720> I<00:04:46.050> don't<00:04:46.350> know<00:04:46.410> does<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.710> work

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
make sense I don't know does it work

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.260 
make sense I don't know does it work
with<00:04:47.040> insects<00:04:47.460> because<00:04:47.610> I'd<00:04:47.820> be<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> perfect

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
with insects because I'd be the perfect

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.030 
with insects because I'd be the perfect
way<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.540> do<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.900> apparently<00:04:49.590> he<00:04:49.680> didn't<00:04:49.919> think

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
way to do it apparently he didn't think

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.560 
way to do it apparently he didn't think
about<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.340> but<00:04:50.730> yeah<00:04:50.880> he's<00:04:51.030> pretty<00:04:51.360> much

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
about that but yeah he's pretty much

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.680 
about that but yeah he's pretty much
kicking<00:04:51.810> shoe<00:04:52.020> Hayes<00:04:52.230> ass<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:53.210> he<00:04:54.210> throws

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
kicking shoe Hayes ass and he throws

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.560 
kicking shoe Hayes ass and he throws
this<00:04:55.169> spear<00:04:56.040> Lance<00:04:56.400> thing<00:04:56.820> which<00:04:57.120> is<00:04:57.150> clearly

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
this spear Lance thing which is clearly

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.620 
this spear Lance thing which is clearly
the<00:04:57.750> same<00:04:58.080> thing<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.500> impaled<00:04:59.220> shojiro<00:04:59.760> so<00:05:00.600> I

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
the same thing that impaled shojiro so I

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.540 
the same thing that impaled shojiro so I
got<00:05:01.080> excited<00:05:01.410> right<00:05:01.710> there<00:05:01.860> something<00:05:02.280> okay

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550

got excited right there something okay
this<00:05:02.730> is<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.910> guy<00:05:03.030> who<00:05:03.060> killed<00:05:03.360> 20<00:05:03.810> he<00:05:03.960> might

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
this is a guy who killed 20 he might

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.560 
this is a guy who killed 20 he might
have<00:05:04.260> his<00:05:04.440> bankai<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:05.190> then<00:05:06.030> someone<00:05:06.390> comes

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.970 
have his bankai and then someone comes
in<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:06.810> just<00:05:06.990> blocks<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.410> with<00:05:07.500> their<00:05:07.620> hand<00:05:07.830> he

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
in and just blocks it with their hand he

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.530 
in and just blocks it with their hand he
just<00:05:08.160> shoves<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.669> side<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.210> was

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
just shoves it to the side and I was

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.120 
just shoves it to the side and I was
thinking<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.870> was<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.080> captain<00:05:10.290> but<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.740> was<00:05:10.980> not

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
thinking it was a captain but I was not

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.330 
thinking it was a captain but I was not
expecting<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.760> be<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:12.540> captain<00:05:13.440> commander

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
expecting it to be the captain commander

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.520 
expecting it to be the captain commander
yamamoto<00:05:15.210> but<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.900> yeah<00:05:16.080> I'm<00:05:16.140> emoto's

there<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:17.250> that<00:05:17.280> kills<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.090> theory<00:05:18.450> that<00:05:18.479> he's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
there so that kills the theory that he's

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.659 
there so that kills the theory that he's
the<00:05:18.900> one<00:05:19.020> who<00:05:19.140> appeared<00:05:19.440> in<00:05:19.470> weka<00:05:19.710> mundo<00:05:20.100> but<00:05:20.460> I

actually<00:06:03.600> like<00:06:04.020> I<00:06:04.080> said<00:06:04.229> if<00:06:04.320> it<00:06:04.410> works<00:06:04.560> with

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
actually like I said if it works with

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.930 
actually like I said if it works with
bugs<00:06:04.950> that'd<00:06:05.160> be<00:06:05.250> really<00:06:05.400> useful<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:05.820> he's

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
bugs that'd be really useful but he's

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.400 
bugs that'd be really useful but he's
probably<00:06:06.030> gonna<00:06:06.270> die<00:06:06.510> right<00:06:06.539> here<00:06:06.780> and<00:06:07.110> we're

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
probably gonna die right here and we're
