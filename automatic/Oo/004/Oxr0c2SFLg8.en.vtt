00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello valley today there are like 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
 promised a review two foundations 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.069
 namely to the two men the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.570
 fitness foundations I have the pros 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 bought a few weeks and indeed 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
 actually only because I'm up 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.639
 youtube scary a lot of good about it 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 I heard about both of them 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.949
 I wanted to get a first there was 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.320
 somehow I could not then 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.270
 decide and so the end has come 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.769
 that I now own both I think 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.449
 the two foundations are quite complete 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.070
 face well because they really are 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.400
 intended for two different skin types 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.930
 are 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 how it is not really so before 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.349
 been aware but as soon as you stop 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 both times you have noticed 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 properly the liquid variant is on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.469
 Every case for dry skin thought and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.530
 the stick version he is for so oeliger 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.120
 or mixed skin or so thought and you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 Both of them have theirs before you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.270
 and disadvantages for me and i think of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.950
 the end it comes very much for you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.260
 evaluate what kind of skin type 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 before you go and hold you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 any of the two purchases are 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.750
 theme price both foundations cost so 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 between eight and ten euros depending on 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.379
 where she just bought i make today 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.789
 on with the liquid variant i believe 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 which was also the first came out 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.140
 I do this all over me and I pitt 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 the packaging is very attractive so 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.369
 she is really pretty solid packed 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.350
 I think they had pump dispensers 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
 relatively noble for keeping it that way 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 Drug product is and I am 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.729
 happy with it yet has to the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.680
 foundation really strong 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.540
 cushion because they are otherwise in the course of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.979
 totally on my face today 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 The desire is the consistency 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.049
 little bit gel-like so she is 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.880
 Although very fluid they are also hand 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.250
 push down a little bit though 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 they are just so involved but it is there 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.850
 not quite messy she has liquid 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 a very rich consistency and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 On the one hand, that's good when you go to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.200
 example has dry skin and so on 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 a bit more moisturizing 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.970
 On the other hand, it needs bad though 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.590
 her to shaved skin for example tends and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 Foundation with you anyway not so 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.970
 the ferry is particularly good at what it does 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 positive on the foundation they notice 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.119
 can blend extremely easily so 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.130
 I can only mine, for example 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 Use your fingers and through the heat of the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 she just gets fantastic in her finger 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 the skin is so incorporated and you 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.969
 gets real nice without much effort 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 Result 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.360
 if you at least find a color in the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.759
 assortment to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.710
 fits and that is with the color namely 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.750
 such a thing so it gives me that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.610
 small and the big assortment ever 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.070
 after what a drug store just around 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 have the corner and in the small assortment 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.950
 I think the color selection pretty much 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.110
 For example, I have so puny things 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.730
 No color found for me in the big one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.160
 There is now a new range 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.440
 color that is relatively suitable for me 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.390
 namely the color 105 it opens 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.640
 any case you enjoy using them and me 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.350
 think for those of you who he is 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.940
 Tending to dry skin is one thing 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.930
 great everyday foundation you look at yourself 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.120
 let's see 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.810
 the opacity is strong means the skin 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.390
 he still sees a bit 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.100
 made up of already but they are confined 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 not really and naturally and 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.650
 somehow pasted out for me 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.420
 the foundations are not optimal I have 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.890
 just yourself in the receipt of agence 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.320
 I have found much rather 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 i like for example this l'orÃ©al or 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.680
 Do not even think about them then 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.420
 baby cream i like the country soul with 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.030
 plus foundation scary happy 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.610
 and you just do not mean it 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.980
 top 3 in it but I definitely see 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.330
 what people think about it and me 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.769
 understand why there are people 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.459
 They just loved it 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.989
 product are 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.450
 it just comes on yours 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.650
 types of skin on what then the stick 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.180
 As for foundation 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.040
 I like that one, I think so 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.900
 just a little bit more because I'm in 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.060
 moment such a little bit oily 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.970
 At least that's how I got it 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.410
 feeling and that can be extreme again 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.440
 easy to apply and I was very 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.910
 skeptical because only the second time 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.820
 That was such a stick foundation 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.750
 used and that looks like that 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.000
 I have such a core here and around this 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.230
 around is a slightly darker color 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.940
 and you just really wear them 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.620
 out of the tube so i have it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.600
 at least always done and that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.390
 works well the consistency 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.090
 is very creamy she is it at all 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.410
 not as solid and as rich as me 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.730
 it had actually imagined so 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.260
 it's not that difficult somehow 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.030
 foundation she glides 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.500
 really over the skin you can then 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.209
 just take your fingers all over 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.190
 Nice to work in the skin works 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.970
 I would not have really good in life 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.950
 expected 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.680
 but the covering power is also over 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.760
 I find a little lower than the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.410
 pi foundation holds in liquid for it 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.790
 this foundation with me also without 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.290
 brother so i can 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.400
 really just wear it that way 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.160
 go out of the house and I can 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.560
 usually less because otherwise 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.270
 keeps nothing and starts right 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.730
 to learn shine the holding has therefore 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.660
 better because they are a bit calmer 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.550
 That's why I find consistency 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.170
 By the way, also that the finish in the first 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.240
 moment after the application is not quite so 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.920
 beautiful and as bright as it is fresh 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.690
 but with the liquid variant after 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.170
 That's about 20 minutes later 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.820
 laid and the foundation is right 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.460
 beautiful with the skin and becomes practical 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.870
 only one with the skin and shines so 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.640
 a little bit more than on 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.290
 Beginning 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.880
 I would say but if you rather too 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.440
 Dry skin tends to leave your fingers 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.450
 of which I could be very good 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.040
 imagine the foundation in 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.540
 so dry sort of like that 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.400
 bit off sets this dry 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.720
 just stop before I stress the video 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.190
 I started to shoot 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.630
 actually want to inform about it 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.160
 like that now with the color selection exactly 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.930
 Somehow I look at the 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.000
 mayday homepage no information 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.380
 Customers are allowed to me but it's just that way 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.330
 the drogerien it so in my 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.460
 environment there are noticed there are 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.680
 annoying variant much less colors 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.270
 as of the liquid can be that it 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.780
 this is because the liquid variant 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.830
 in the end it covers more and me 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.720
 I think you have to be special 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.730
 be careful that you ask the right question 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.710
 get caught or it's just because of it 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.640
 that gestik variant is new now and 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.770
 maybe not quite as popular 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.510
 or no idea i would be very happy 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.620
 happy if could write what you 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.360
 for experiences with the two 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.550
 foundations if you have 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.310
 I'm really pleased to have tested 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.590
 very much on your comments and your thumbs 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.060
 high course and so on, it does 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.840
 good my dear and see you next 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.840
 Video
