lot of comments from a lot of people

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.200 
lot of comments from a lot of people
saying<00:00:39.140> how<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.469> fix<00:00:39.769> it<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:40.249> know<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:40.940> did<00:00:41.149> a

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
saying how to fix it you know so I did a

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.150 
saying how to fix it you know so I did a
little<00:00:41.359> research<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:41.989> what<00:00:42.410> I<00:00:42.440> found<00:00:42.710> out<00:00:42.920> is

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
little research and what I found out is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.430 
little research and what I found out is
that<00:00:43.370> Apple<00:00:43.999> when<00:00:44.149> they<00:00:44.269> went<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.629> 4.2.1

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
that Apple when they went to the 4.2.1

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.910 
that Apple when they went to the 4.2.1
firmware<00:00:46.210> they<00:00:47.210> changed<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.140> locations<00:00:48.739> of

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
firmware they changed the locations of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.340 
firmware they changed the locations of
the<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:49.940> themes<00:00:50.179> folder<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.019> then<00:00:51.170> it

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
the of the themes folder so then it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.439 
the of the themes folder so then it
would<00:00:51.440> be<00:00:51.559> even<00:00:51.859> harder<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.460> get<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.879> to

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
would be even harder to get to the to

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.090 
would be even harder to get to the to
the<00:00:53.600> icons<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> wallpaper<00:00:54.769> and<00:00:55.039> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
the icons and the wallpaper and the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.719 
the icons and the wallpaper and the
folders<00:00:55.550> are<00:00:55.999> I'm<00:00:56.179> sorry<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.690> lockscreen

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
folders are I'm sorry in the lockscreen

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.939 
folders are I'm sorry in the lockscreen
basically<00:00:58.729> so<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.120> means<00:00:59.649> it<00:01:00.649> would<00:01:00.829> be

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
basically so that means it would be

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.680 
basically so that means it would be
harder<00:01:01.249> for<00:01:01.280> city<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:01.850> winter<00:01:02.089> board<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.420> find

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
harder for city and winter board to find

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.119 
harder for city and winter board to find
them<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.079> actually<00:01:03.229> put<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.649> themes<00:01:03.920> up

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
them and actually put the themes up

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.980 
them and actually put the themes up
there<00:01:04.309> for<00:01:04.850> some<00:01:04.970> reason<00:01:05.269> my<00:01:05.449> themes<00:01:05.780> have

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
there for some reason my themes have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.480 
there for some reason my themes have
been<00:01:06.020> working<00:01:06.380> fine<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:06.979> might<00:01:07.130> be<00:01:07.159> just

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
been working fine so this might be just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.270 
been working fine so this might be just
for<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> few<00:01:08.180> of<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.390> guys<00:01:08.650> such<00:01:09.650> as<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:10.190> the

little bit while this is loading up I'm

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.569 
little bit while this is loading up I'm
going<00:01:59.899> to<00:01:59.960> be<00:02:00.049> doing<00:02:00.229> about<00:02:00.530> two<00:02:00.770> parts<00:02:01.159> this

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
going to be doing about two parts this

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.910 
going to be doing about two parts this
is<00:02:01.759> for<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.119> lockscreen<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.679> wallpaper

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
is for the lockscreen and the wallpaper

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.980 
is for the lockscreen and the wallpaper
this<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.579> just<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.939> loophole<00:02:05.359> of<00:02:05.390> how<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.749> get

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
this is just the loophole of how to get

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.590 
this is just the loophole of how to get
around<00:02:06.079> it<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.649> how<00:02:07.249> to<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:08.270> know<00:02:08.360> almost

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
around it and how to you know almost

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.749 
around it and how to you know almost
cope<00:02:08.990> with<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.350> because<00:02:09.649> there<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.460> going<00:02:10.700> to

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
cope with it because there is going to

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.690 
cope with it because there is going to
be<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:10.940> new<00:02:11.650> new<00:02:12.650> update<00:02:13.010> coming<00:02:13.310> out<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> new

most likely iPod users its firmware for
point

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
point

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.320 
point
three<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.350> think<00:02:21.530> 4.3<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.700> beta<00:02:22.970> as<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
three I think 4.3 it's on beta as of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.840 
three I think 4.3 it's on beta as of
right<00:02:23.450> now<00:02:23.510> only<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.890> programmers<00:02:25.490> get<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
right now only like programmers get it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.440 
right now only like programmers get it
but<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:27.110> will<00:02:27.380> be<00:02:27.440> coming<00:02:27.650> out<00:02:27.830> soon<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:29.210> that's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
but it will be coming out soon so that's

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.050 
but it will be coming out soon so that's
good<00:02:29.690> but<00:02:30.380> like<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.890> said<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.760> just

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
good but like I said this is just

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.790 
good but like I said this is just
something<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.390> cope<00:02:32.660> with<00:02:32.840> it's<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.680> not

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
something to cope with it's not it's not

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.410 
something to cope with it's not it's not
like<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> hundred<00:02:34.310> percent<00:02:34.400> fix<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.120> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
like a hundred percent fix it is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.990 
like a hundred percent fix it is
something<00:02:36.260> -<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> can<00:02:37.400> at<00:02:37.490> least<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.940> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
something - so you can at least have a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.170 
something - so you can at least have a
theme<00:02:38.300> for<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.570> while<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.820> I'm<00:02:40.820> gonna<00:02:41.000> actually
