00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.780
 I am very happy to participate in this event. Please advise me today. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 The game is over. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.200
 1 lap full length 4 kilometers, this track is very fast 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.670
 Quite difficult to grab a good seat 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.670
 Oh, it seems that there has been a slight collision. 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.910
 Followed up again. Haven't given up yet! 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.920
 Competing for the second place, the river squad is juxtaposed ahead from the outside! 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.090
 The river cricket player is ahead of the game, and the RAMA players have not given up yet! 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.020
 Yamada player's first arrival end point 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.460
 The river runners behind are also getting rid of their opponents! 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.910
 Start off 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.080
 What kind of running method does the CHOI player show after departure? 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.210
 Just after the rear seems to have collided 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.420
 It seems that the leading drivers have collided. 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.420
 CHOI still clings to the 1st throne in the chaos 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.920
 The river cricket player rushed forward 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.990
 The river player chased the Takahashi player in the first corner. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.960
 Currently ranked 2 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 The river å°» player gradually approached the Yoshida player in front 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.140

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.440
 Finally arrived on the 8th lap, the last lap 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.920
 The Yoshida player in front is half-slip! The first one is handing people! 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 Can the river squatter stay in the first place, can this throne hold on to the end? 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.790
 a slight sway in the vehicle 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.300
 Approaching the close line of the finish line! 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.870
 Who's winning? ! 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.470
 Yamada player! 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.570
 No, it is a river player! 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.850
 The river player is the first place. Actually only a gap of 0.012 seconds! ! 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.960
 The first is that Korean CHOI players start from pole position. 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.060
 But there are Yamada players gradually paralleling 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.940
 Indonesia's RAMA player temporarily stays in the first place 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.610
 Just started the first lap of each car, it has already started the first fierce battle. 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.050
 Yamada and Kagawa players closest to the championship 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.810
 Gradually increase the ranking 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.150
 2 cars are juxtaposed. Yamada player is one step ahead 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.820
 At this time, Takahashi players cut into the inside of the Yamada player's body. 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.420
 But still can't stop him 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.130

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.740
 The willpower that never gives up is admirable 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.610
 44 seconds 6! 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.140
 Yamada player's lap record is 1 second faster 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.110
 Ah, he looks at it here. Yamada player rushed into the inside! 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.520
 Parallel. Now ahead! 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.050
 But the RAMA player has not given up whether he is looking for an opportunity to rush into the inside. 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.550
 Parallel! Now juxtaposed! 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.990
