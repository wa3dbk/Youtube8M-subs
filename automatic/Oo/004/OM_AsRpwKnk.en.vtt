here so we'll talk about that basically
you're<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.110> double<00:02:01.920> click<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you're just going to double click on the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.789 
you're just going to double click on the
file<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> open<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> GarageBand

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
file it's going to open in GarageBand

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
file it's going to open in GarageBand
and<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.640> pretty<00:02:06.000> much<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.229> not

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and that's pretty much it that is not

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
and that's pretty much it that is not
that's<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.160> one-man<00:02:08.640> operation<00:02:08.819> right<00:02:09.509> there

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that's a one-man operation right there

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.619 
that's a one-man operation right there
you<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.229> need<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.849> have<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> manual<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
you don't need to have a manual for that

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.190 
you don't need to have a manual for that
so<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.080> very<00:02:13.349> very<00:02:13.680> simple

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so it's very very simple

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.000

so what we're going to do now is like
open<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.570> little<00:03:55.780> menu<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.380> you'll<00:03:56.859> see<00:03:57.160> a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
open that little menu and you'll see a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.610 
open that little menu and you'll see a
metronome<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.630> can<00:03:58.780> change<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.230> tempo

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
metronome and you can change the tempo

metronome and you can change the tempo
let's<00:04:00.370> try<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.700> let's<00:04:01.269> see<00:04:01.480> what<00:04:01.600> happens

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
let's try it let's see what happens

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.599 
let's try it let's see what happens
let's<00:04:04.200> loop<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.440> cut<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.799> drum<00:04:06.160> loop<00:04:06.370> going

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
let's loop this cut this drum loop going

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.220 
let's loop this cut this drum loop going
and<00:04:06.850> we'll<00:04:06.970> fool<00:04:07.209> around<00:04:07.329> with<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.630> tempo

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.450 

here<00:04:11.230> we<00:04:11.319> go

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.590 

obviously<00:04:19.460> if<00:04:19.550> you<00:04:19.640> slow<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.910> down<00:04:20.030> too<00:04:20.390> much

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
obviously if you slow it down too much

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.130 
obviously if you slow it down too much
it's<00:04:21.350> not<00:04:21.590> going<00:04:21.770> to<00:04:21.830> sound<00:04:22.010> great<00:04:22.990> this<00:04:23.990> is

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
it's not going to sound great this is

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.080 
it's not going to sound great this is
down

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
down

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:35.440 
down
there's<00:04:26.090> 86<00:04:30.970> not<00:04:31.970> bad<00:04:32.270> pretty<00:04:33.200> good<00:04:34.450> these

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
there's 86 not bad pretty good these

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.270 
there's 86 not bad pretty good these

oh<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:38.200> fantastic<00:04:39.200> drummer<00:04:39.470> programmer<00:04:40.210> he

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
oh so fantastic drummer programmer he

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.790 
oh so fantastic drummer programmer he
did<00:04:41.390> a<00:04:41.420> fabulous<00:04:41.750> job<00:04:42.020> with<00:04:42.290> this

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
did a fabulous job with this

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.430 
did a fabulous job with this
okay<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.280> there's<00:04:43.550> 86<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.750> basically<00:04:45.170> here's

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
okay so there's 86 so basically here's

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.740 
okay so there's 86 so basically here's
191<00:04:46.160> let<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.460> sound<00:04:46.700> like<00:04:49.270> Jojo<00:04:50.270> Mayer<00:04:50.480> eat

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
191 let that sound like Jojo Mayer eat

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.670 
191 let that sound like Jojo Mayer eat
your<00:04:50.960> heart<00:04:51.200> out<00:04:55.330> pretty<00:04:56.330> good<00:04:56.510> alright<00:04:57.500> so

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
your heart out pretty good alright so

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.550 
your heart out pretty good alright so
you<00:04:57.770> see<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:59.480> quality<00:04:59.810> of<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.380> of

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
you see that the the quality of the of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.650 
you see that the the quality of the of
the<00:05:01.040> loop<00:05:01.280> doesn't<00:05:01.580> degenerate<00:05:02.210> too<00:05:02.450> much

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
the loop doesn't degenerate too much

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.390 
the loop doesn't degenerate too much
when<00:05:02.900> it's<00:05:03.050> too<00:05:03.200> fast<00:05:03.500> or<00:05:03.740> too<00:05:03.770> slow<00:05:03.920> and

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
when it's too fast or too slow and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.510 
when it's too fast or too slow and
that's<00:05:04.910> basically<00:05:05.390> it

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
that's basically it

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.150 
that's basically it
years<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.760> years<00:05:07.820> ago<00:05:08.570> when<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.320> started<00:05:10.010> doing

years and years ago when I started doing

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.340 
years and years ago when I started doing
these<00:05:10.460> videos<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.630> things<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:12.020> was<00:05:12.170> always

these videos and things I was always
interested<00:05:12.800> in<00:05:13.160> doing<00:05:13.790> a<00:05:13.880> project<00:05:14.150> like<00:05:14.510> this

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
interested in doing a project like this

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.320 
interested in doing a project like this
where<00:05:15.020> you<00:05:15.110> could<00:05:15.260> play<00:05:15.500> along<00:05:15.890> with<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.790> band

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.130 
into the tower power I wanted to be a
lat<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:21.920> even<00:05:22.130> before<00:05:22.250> I<00:05:22.490> came<00:05:22.610> back<00:05:22.970> in<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:23.390> 98

lat and even before I came back in in 98
I<00:05:24.320> wanted<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.890> do<00:05:25.040> some<00:05:25.310> kind<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.550> project

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
I wanted to do some kind of project

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.830 
I wanted to do some kind of project
where<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.600> was<00:05:27.350> tower<00:05:27.620> power<00:05:28.010> music<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.970> this

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
where it was tower power music and this

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.810 
where it was tower power music and this
was<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.140> perfect<00:05:30.350> vehicle<00:05:30.740> for<00:05:31.160> it

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
was the perfect vehicle for it

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.860 
was the perfect vehicle for it
excellently<00:05:32.510> produced<00:05:34.060> studio<00:05:35.060> tracks<00:05:35.540> and

very<00:05:36.650> easy<00:05:36.950> to<00:05:37.160> play<00:05:37.310> along<00:05:37.700> with<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.480> sound

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
very easy to play along with the sound

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.380 
very easy to play along with the sound
is<00:05:39.080> fabulous<00:05:39.710> everything's<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:41.000> know<00:05:41.090> been

is fabulous everything's you know been
remixed<00:05:42.200> so<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.890> works<00:05:43.160> perfectly<00:05:43.730> if

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
remixed so that it works perfectly if

remixed so that it works perfectly if
you<00:05:44.090> want<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.330> play<00:05:44.510> along<00:05:44.660> with<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:45.050> loops

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
you want to play along with the loops

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.730 
you want to play along with the loops
every<00:05:46.400> song<00:05:46.670> has<00:05:47.030> two<00:05:47.330> or<00:05:47.480> three<00:05:47.510> loops<00:05:48.470> that

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
every song has two or three loops that

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.980 
every song has two or three loops that
are<00:05:48.860> associated<00:05:49.160> with<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.420> have<00:05:50.690> verse

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
are associated with it so you have verse

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.520 
are associated with it so you have verse
chorus<00:05:51.530> maybe<00:05:52.280> an<00:05:52.430> out<00:05:52.640> chorus<00:05:53.600> but<00:05:54.080> all<00:05:54.320> of

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
chorus maybe an out chorus but all of

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.320 
chorus maybe an out chorus but all of
the<00:05:54.620> important<00:05:55.190> parts<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.610> song<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.180> that

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
the important parts of the song so that

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.300 
the important parts of the song so that
you<00:05:56.450> can<00:05:56.600> practice<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.620> know<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.770> the

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
you can practice you know the the

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.210 
you can practice you know the the
component<00:05:58.970> loops<00:05:59.350> that<00:06:00.350> go<00:06:00.560> with<00:06:00.860> the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
component loops that go with the

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
component loops that go with the
particular<00:06:01.790> songs<00:06:02.150> or<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:03.530> can<00:06:04.030> use<00:06:05.030> any

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
particular songs or you can use any

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.760 
particular songs or you can use any
other<00:06:05.330> materials<00:06:06.140> I<00:06:06.260> have<00:06:06.380> like<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.620> know

other materials I have like you know
future<00:06:07.160> sounds<00:06:07.520> we<00:06:07.640> worked<00:06:07.850> on<00:06:08.060> some<00:06:08.570> of<00:06:08.690> those

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
future sounds we worked on some of those

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.260 
future sounds we worked on some of those
things<00:06:09.110> in<00:06:10.010> some<00:06:10.340> of<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.520> lessons<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.000> we

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
things in some of the lessons that we

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.590 
things in some of the lessons that we
filmed<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.310> so<00:06:13.310> all<00:06:13.580> of<00:06:13.790> that<00:06:13.820> stuff<00:06:14.060> works<00:06:14.390> in

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
filmed and so all of that stuff works in

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.910 
filmed and so all of that stuff works in
there<00:06:14.720> there's<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.110> funky<00:06:15.470> beat<00:06:15.710> that's

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
there there's the funky beat that's

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.610 
there there's the funky beat that's
another<00:06:16.220> one<00:06:16.430> of<00:06:16.550> my<00:06:16.670> books<00:06:16.960> you<00:06:17.960> can<00:06:18.110> use<00:06:18.350> any

other people's books that you're working
out<00:06:25.910> of<00:06:25.940> try<00:06:26.660> it<00:06:26.720> with<00:06:26.990> some<00:06:27.200> of<00:06:27.290> those<00:06:27.440> loops

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
out of try it with some of those loops

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.710 
out of try it with some of those loops
experiment<00:06:28.460> with<00:06:28.580> tempo<00:06:29.000> and<00:06:29.210> it's

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
experiment with tempo and it's

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.230 
experiment with tempo and it's
very<00:06:29.960> very<00:06:30.230> simple<00:06:30.710> so<00:06:31.310> don't<00:06:31.910> be<00:06:32.000> intimidated
