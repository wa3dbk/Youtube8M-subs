00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:20.820
 So let's make it easy to feature the features of double g 3 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:25.950
 The best point I will explain is the lens this time 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:31.840
 This is 25mm much wider than previous lenses 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:36.310
 Then the brightness became very bright lens with f 2.0 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.810
 In addition, it is the first time as the double g series of Penta Zen 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.829
 Shake reaction because optical image stabilization has been entered 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.640
 Contains the mark sr 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 And of course you already have a water camera so it's waterproof 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.060
 Then it is this of blue of retirement 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.340
 Each have power up 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:03.440
 It is double g 3 this time, but the design of the body is as usual 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:09.610
 Has become a design conscious of the outdoors 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.610
 You can grip very high grip well in the part of the neck here 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.730
 Then it's back, but this time 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.710
 It is such a level attachment 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.159
 And Do not entered is this kind of function 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.830
 Electronic compass 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.830
 I entered such a function 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.530
 Then here 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.100
 It is wide conversion with ぅ 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.140
 This is a wide conversion lens from Ricoh 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 By arm you are wearing this 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.890
 If you take a wider photo 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.890
 It became possible to say 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.240
 Finally, shopping 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.240
 After here 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.579
 There is battery concentration, but there is one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.740
 Battery with 1 door from this time 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:24.100
 was in one door Fu say pc hdmi with sd card 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.610
 The previous product was here and here , but it is very waterproof because it has become one 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.050
 is not it 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.050
 I am improving reliability 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.720
 See you is a demonstration Mr. Adotchi 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:46.390
 When the camera is turned down and placed on the charging stand like this , charging starts automatically. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:54.150
 If this is a scene then this is 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.150
 It is the power of the lamp this is flashing looks like it can be seen that now in charge
