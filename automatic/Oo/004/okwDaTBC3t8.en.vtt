got<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.350> chance<00:01:54.590> at<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:54.890> think<00:01:55.160> if<00:01:55.280> all

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
got a chance at that I think if all

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.000 
got a chance at that I think if all
depends<00:01:55.970> on<00:01:56.060> who's<00:01:56.180> going<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:56.870> if<00:01:57.440> if

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
depends on who's going in it but if if

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.970 
depends on who's going in it but if if
anything<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.670> think<00:01:59.080> he<00:02:00.080> might<00:02:00.230> he<00:02:00.680> might<00:02:00.710> get

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
anything I think he might he might get

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.610 
anything I think he might he might get
her<00:02:01.100> or<00:02:01.340> Sammy<00:02:01.810> Fernando<00:02:02.810> pisani<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.320> think

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
her or Sammy Fernando pisani I think

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.710 
her or Sammy Fernando pisani I think
he's<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:04.250> guy<00:02:04.490> who<00:02:04.550> likes<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.940> pick<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.330> corners

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
he's a guy who likes to pick the corners

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.109 
he's a guy who likes to pick the corners
and<00:02:05.990> he's<00:02:06.170> he's<00:02:06.620> really<00:02:06.950> accurate<00:02:07.340> I'll<00:02:07.820> go
