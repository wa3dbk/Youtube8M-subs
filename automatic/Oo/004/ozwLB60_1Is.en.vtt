very interested in being in them and I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.390 
very interested in being in them and I
haven't<00:02:46.140> been<00:02:46.200> offered<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> role<00:02:46.770> or<00:02:47.040> anything

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.950 
haven't been offered a role or anything
but<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:47.850> very<00:02:48.030> exciting<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.480> them<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
but it was very exciting for them to

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.660 
but it was very exciting for them to
have<00:02:49.050> asked<00:02:49.500> me<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.130> reading<00:02:50.460> right

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and so I thought well at the very least

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.660 
and so I thought well at the very least
they'll<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.500> audition<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.490> had

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
frontal nudity I had to think about

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.720

of people die and get killed in a movie

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.050 
of people die and get killed in a movie
and<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.470> still<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.709> rated<00:03:35.100> pg-13<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and it can still be rated pg-13 but the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.000 
and it can still be rated pg-13 but the
moment<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.450> show<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> penis<00:03:37.080> it's<00:03:37.230> rated<00:03:37.530> R<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
moment you show a penis it's rated R and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.440 
moment you show a penis it's rated R and
it<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:38.280> seems<00:03:38.400> ridiculous<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.000> me<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.420> I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
it just seems ridiculous to me and so I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.640 
it just seems ridiculous to me and so I
thought<00:03:39.630> first<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.989> all<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.470> practice

thought first of all I have to practice

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.979 
thought first of all I have to practice
what<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> preach<00:03:41.070> right<00:03:41.520> secondly<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.360> wrote<00:03:42.959> a

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
what I preach right secondly I wrote a
