thing is amazing especially a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.710 
thing is amazing especially a
combination<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.650> first<00:00:25.980> evolution<00:00:26.720> I'm

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
combination with first evolution I'm

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
combination with first evolution I'm
actually<00:00:27.900> rethinking<00:00:28.619> lee<00:00:28.800> i<00:00:28.830> play<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.310> deck

summon one evil sore monster from your
deck<00:00:39.980> really<00:00:40.980> good<00:00:41.180> what<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> say<00:00:42.920> first

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
deck really good what can I say first

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
deck really good what can I say first
evolution<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.730> instant<00:00:45.210> evo<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.960> card

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
evolution and instant evo make that card

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.119 
evolution and instant evo make that card
broken<00:00:47.510> basically<00:00:48.510> force<00:00:48.750> doubling<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
broken basically force doubling as you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400

monster<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.960> guy<00:01:04.140> doesn't<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
monster now this guy doesn't time and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.070 
monster now this guy doesn't time and
because<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> says<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.729> he's<00:01:05.850> tributed<00:01:06.360> that's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
because it says if he's tributed that's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.630 
because it says if he's tributed that's
already<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.590> been<00:01:07.950> shown<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:10.640> basically

later game if you pull this off for this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.090 
later game if you pull this off for this
guy<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.930> looking<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.520> two<00:01:17.900> volcanoes

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
guy you're looking at two volcanoes

guy you're looking at two volcanoes
hitting<00:01:20.100> their<00:01:20.280> effects<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.850> maybe<00:01:21.090> these<00:01:21.210> two

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hitting their effects on maybe these two

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.800 
hitting their effects on maybe these two
that<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:23.299> once<00:01:24.299> instant

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that you got out with this once instant

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.030 
that you got out with this once instant
evolution<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.470> instant<00:01:26.009> evo<00:01:26.390> it's<00:01:27.390> uh<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
evolution or instant evo it's uh the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
evolution or instant evo it's uh the
network<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.640> am<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> try<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.689> with

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
network I am going to try that out with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.469 
network I am going to try that out with
three<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.920> maybe<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.090> put<00:01:33.299> two<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
three of these and maybe just put two of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
three of these and maybe just put two of
these<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.200> stand<00:01:34.890> three<00:01:35.250> weslo<00:01:35.810> because<00:01:36.810> I'll

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
these and stand three weslo because I'll

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
these and stand three weslo because I'll
have<00:01:37.890> probably<00:01:38.729> two<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:38.970> three<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.329> these

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
have probably two or three of these

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.920 
have probably two or three of these
still<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.220> maybe<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.610> instant<00:01:42.150> evo<00:01:42.509> or

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
still and maybe to instant evo or

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
still and maybe to instant evo or
probably<00:01:43.560> three<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.829> these<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.220> instant

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
probably three of these in one instant

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.480 
probably three of these in one instant
evo<00:01:44.850> maybe<00:01:45.439> it's<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.590> looking<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.189> it'll

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
evo maybe it's just looking like it'll

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
evo maybe it's just looking like it'll
really<00:01:47.670> work<00:01:47.790> especially<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.320> gets

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
really work especially because this gets

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
really work especially because this gets
rid<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.770> dead<00:01:50.040> Wes<00:01:50.280> blows<00:01:50.579> for<00:01:50.970> another

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
rid of dead Wes blows for another

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.920 
rid of dead Wes blows for another
volcano<00:01:51.950> stuff<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.659> thing<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
volcano stuff like that so this thing is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.039 
volcano stuff like that so this thing is
really<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> play<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.189> Diplo<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
really for the play on Diplo so what you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
really for the play on Diplo so what you
guys<00:01:58.170> might<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.530> been<00:01:58.649> able<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.729> deck

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
guys might have been able to see my deck

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.429 
guys might have been able to see my deck
from<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> probably<00:02:02.960> about<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
from here this is probably about the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
from here this is probably about the
deck<00:02:04.680> we're<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.250> running<00:02:05.430> once<00:02:05.939> all

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
deck we're going to be running once all

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.080 
deck we're going to be running once all
the<00:02:06.210> new<00:02:06.299> stuff<00:02:06.360> comes<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:08.550> might<00:02:08.970> change
