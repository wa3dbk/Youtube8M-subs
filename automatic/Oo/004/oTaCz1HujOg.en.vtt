00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the bear holder like it's supposed to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.180 
the bear holder like it's supposed to
that<00:00:41.160> bearing<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.670> shot<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that bearing is shot this is not in the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
that bearing is shot this is not in the
middle<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.879> stick<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.270> finger<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.750> the

bearing right now on the other side so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
bearing right now on the other side so
step<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.730> loosen<00:00:50.730> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
step one what you need to do loosen up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.580 
step one what you need to do loosen up
your<00:00:50.969> track<00:00:51.210> both<00:00:51.510> sides<00:00:51.809> loosen<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.379> as

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
your track both sides loosen it up as

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.569 
your track both sides loosen it up as
much<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.070> can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
set screw in it you just gotta take can

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.999 
set screw in it you just gotta take can
get<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.650> screwed<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:28.009> you

taking your whack these it'll tighten up

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
taking your whack these it'll tighten up
on<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.229> edge<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> bearing<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
on that edge of that bearing with this

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.870 
on that edge of that bearing with this
locking<00:01:33.360> collar<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.220> mine<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.549> actually

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
locking collar and mine it's actually

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
locking collar and mine it's actually
already<00:01:36.150> separated<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> bearing<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
already separated from the bearing so I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870 
already separated from the bearing so I
don't<00:01:37.619> need<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> worry<00:01:38.040> about<00:01:38.159> doing<00:01:38.579> anything

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
don't need to worry about doing anything

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
don't need to worry about doing anything
with<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:40.170> you'll<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> get

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
with it right now but you'll have to get

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that tightened back on there later now

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.840

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
your cable out that's at the end of your

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.130 
your cable out that's at the end of your
cable<00:02:09.459> that's<00:02:09.880> busted<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:10.780> cause<00:02:10.959> your

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
cable that's busted that can cause your

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.500 
cable that's busted that can cause your
speedometer<00:02:11.800> not<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.190> work<00:02:12.370> currently<00:02:13.300> on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
speedometer not to work currently on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.960 
speedometer not to work currently on
this<00:02:13.630> number<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.050> spawner<00:02:14.380> doesn't<00:02:14.830> work<00:02:15.010> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
this number the spawner doesn't work and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.910 
this number the spawner doesn't work and
I<00:02:16.060> figure<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.660> mechanism<00:02:17.380> inside<00:02:17.560> of

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
I figure it's the mechanism inside of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.559 
I figure it's the mechanism inside of
there<00:02:18.099> that's<00:02:18.280> shot<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.209> now<00:02:19.330> you're<00:02:19.510> gonna

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
there that's shot so now you're gonna

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.259 
there that's shot so now you're gonna
take<00:02:19.870> these<00:02:20.110> three<00:02:20.470> nuts<00:02:20.830> off<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.459> then<00:02:22.060> your

take these three nuts off and then your

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.880 
take these three nuts off and then your
bearing<00:02:22.720> will<00:02:22.930> come<00:02:23.140> apart<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.739> other

is your holder on this side as well on
the<00:04:27.170> inside<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.500> bearings<00:04:27.830> are<00:04:27.950> real<00:04:28.100> nice<00:04:28.280> on

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
the inside the bearings are real nice on

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.640 
the inside the bearings are real nice on
this<00:04:28.760> case<00:04:29.120> because<00:04:30.080> they're<00:04:30.290> right<00:04:30.440> there

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
this case because they're right there

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.200 
this case because they're right there
you<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.890> take<00:04:31.010> this<00:04:31.130> hold<00:04:31.340> off<00:04:31.490> some<00:04:32.000> there's

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
you just take this hold off some there's

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.850 
you just take this hold off some there's
a<00:04:32.270> metal<00:04:32.660> thing<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:33.020> goes<00:04:33.170> around<00:04:33.350> them<00:04:33.710> and

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
a metal thing that goes around them and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.680 
a metal thing that goes around them and
that<00:04:34.130> makes<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.550> cases<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.060> real<00:04:35.300> pain<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.660> the
