00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.870 
what I'm going to do is give you a quick
little<00:00:14.820> demo<00:00:14.999> of<00:00:15.650> this<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:17.190> capo<00:00:17.580> here

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
little demo of this little capo here

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.470 
little demo of this little capo here
which<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.360> called<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> third<00:00:18.960> hand<00:00:19.230> capo<00:00:20.480> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
which is called the third hand capo and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.260 
which is called the third hand capo and
as<00:00:21.690> you<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:21.990> see<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.620> capo<00:00:23.130> I've<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.030> it<00:00:24.150> set

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
as you can see it capo I've got it set

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.360 
as you can see it capo I've got it set
up<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> moment<00:00:24.810> where<00:00:25.290> it's<00:00:25.470> keeping

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
up at the moment where it's keeping

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.880 
up at the moment where it's keeping
every<00:00:26.910> string<00:00:27.570> apart<00:00:28.020> from<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.350> bottom<00:00:28.650> east

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
every string apart from the bottom east

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.810 
every string apart from the bottom east
ring<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.600> essentially<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.820> dropping

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
ring so it's essentially like dropping

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.720 
ring so it's essentially like dropping
Dee<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.510> you're<00:00:33.780> working<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.950> opposed<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
Dee but you're working up as opposed to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
Dee but you're working up as opposed to
down<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:37.230> I'll<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.379> put<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.339> on<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:48.980> ok<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
down so I'll just put this on here ok so

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.260 
down so I'll just put this on here ok so
I've<00:00:50.339> got<00:00:50.519> it<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.789> now

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.230 

you

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.600 

so<00:01:03.900> what<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.260> essentially<00:01:04.950> doing<00:01:05.160> is<00:01:05.400> giving

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so what it's essentially doing is giving

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.770 
so what it's essentially doing is giving
you<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.300> lot<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.350> bottom<00:01:07.800> end<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:09.600> you're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you a lot more bottom end but you're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.860 
you a lot more bottom end but you're
going<00:01:09.960> up

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.020 

okay<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:16.380> sort<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.800> what<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.550> I'd

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
okay so that's sort of what you can I'd

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
okay so that's sort of what you can I'd
suggest<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.110> you're<00:01:19.230> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
suggest if you're going to get one of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
suggest if you're going to get one of
these<00:01:20.370> Capo's<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.510> would<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> good<00:01:21.900> place

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
these Capo's that would be a good place

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.969 
these Capo's that would be a good place
to<00:01:22.410> start<00:01:23.180> experimenting<00:01:24.260> okay<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.680> next

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to start experimenting okay so the next

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.340 
to start experimenting okay so the next
thing<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.880> looking<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:28.080> slightly

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
thing if you're looking to be slightly

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.380 
thing if you're looking to be slightly
more<00:01:28.800> advanced<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> obviously<00:01:29.760> with<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
more advanced and obviously with this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.200 
more advanced and obviously with this
type<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> capo<00:01:31.550> having<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.729> option<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
type of capo having the option of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.320 
type of capo having the option of
choosing<00:01:33.510> any<00:01:34.640> combination<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.729> strings<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
choosing any combination of strings and

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.270 
choosing any combination of strings and
then<00:01:36.420> obviously<00:01:36.570> I've<00:01:37.229> seen<00:01:37.560> people<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:38.070> two

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
then obviously I've seen people with two

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
then obviously I've seen people with two
and<00:01:38.430> three<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> these<00:01:38.970> Capo's<00:01:39.680> playing<00:01:40.680> all

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and three of these Capo's playing all

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.210 
and three of these Capo's playing all
kinds<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.610> tunings<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.979> haven't<00:01:43.979> thought

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
kinds of tunings that I haven't thought

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.420 
kinds of tunings that I haven't thought
of<00:01:44.280> using<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> possibilities<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.070> sort

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
of using but the possibilities are sort

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
of using but the possibilities are sort
of<00:01:47.460> analyst<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.149> type<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> device<00:01:49.050> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of analyst with this type of device so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.030 
of analyst with this type of device so
if<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.280> were<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.840> go<00:01:51.840> from<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:52.800> flip

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
if we were to go from this and then flip

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.150 
if we were to go from this and then flip
these<00:01:53.250> two<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.560> if<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.770> were<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> put

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
these two up like this if we were to put

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.240 
these two up like this if we were to put
that<00:01:56.310> straight<00:01:56.550> back<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.250> basically

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
that straight back on that is basically

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.930 
that straight back on that is basically
the<00:01:59.550> equivalent<00:01:59.640> of<00:02:00.560> having<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.979> dad<00:02:02.670> gal

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
the equivalent of having a dad gal

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.730 
the equivalent of having a dad gal
tuning<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.570> I'll<00:02:03.750> give<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.170> quick<00:02:04.530> little

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
tuning so I'll give you a quick little

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:19.010 
tuning so I'll give you a quick little
demonstration<00:02:05.550> of<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:32.620 

you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.800 

okay<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.770> cool<00:02:33.980> part<00:02:34.250> about<00:02:34.370> these

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
okay and the cool part about these

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.510 
okay and the cool part about these
Capo's<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:35.990> think<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.310> were<00:02:37.460> to

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
Capo's I think is that if you were to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.180 
Capo's I think is that if you were to
move<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.940> further<00:02:38.180> down<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.660> neck<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
move it further down the neck on the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.920 
move it further down the neck on the
strings<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.640> are<00:02:40.760> open<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.450> then<00:02:41.780> start

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
strings that are open you can then start

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.800 
strings that are open you can then start
fretting<00:02:42.440> behind<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.310> capo<00:02:43.730> which<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:44.780> I

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
fretting behind the capo which is I

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.130 
fretting behind the capo which is I
guess<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.560> new<00:02:46.490> technique<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.150> guess<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.390> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
guess a new technique I guess that you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.380 
guess a new technique I guess that you
wouldn't<00:02:48.350> be<00:02:48.410> able<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.800> without<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:50.000> capo

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
wouldn't be able to do without the capo

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.360 
wouldn't be able to do without the capo
so<00:02:51.170> if<00:02:51.380> you're<00:02:51.530> looking<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.920> write<00:02:52.100> your<00:02:52.250> own

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
so if you're looking to write your own

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.980 
so if you're looking to write your own
music<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.850> think<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.150> opens<00:02:53.480> up<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.720> lot<00:02:53.750> more

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
music I think it opens up a lot more

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.840 
music I think it opens up a lot more
possibilities<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.950> obviously<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:55.670> got

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
possibilities and obviously if you got

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.370 
possibilities and obviously if you got
this<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.970> take<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.150> off<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.510> leave<00:03:00.230> it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
this and you take it off and leave it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.260 
this and you take it off and leave it
exactly<00:03:00.620> as<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:01.460> flip<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.910> over<00:03:02.030> this

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
exactly as it is but flip it over this

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.370 
exactly as it is but flip it over this
way<00:03:03.490> then<00:03:04.490> you've<00:03:04.670> got<00:03:04.850> an<00:03:04.970> open<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.900> tuning

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
way then you've got an open a tuning

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.500 
way then you've got an open a tuning
which<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.710> very<00:03:07.400> sort<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.910> popular<00:03:08.330> with

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
which is very sort of popular with

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.300 
which is very sort of popular with
salade<00:03:09.320> players<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:09.920> sort<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.250> thing

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
salade players and that sort of thing

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.830 
salade players and that sort of thing
that's<00:03:10.610> not<00:03:10.760> something<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.270> do<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.810> I

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
that's not something that I do so I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.110 
that's not something that I do so I
don't<00:03:12.080> won't<00:03:12.230> demonstrate<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.340> but

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
don't won't demonstrate that for you but

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.700 
don't won't demonstrate that for you but
there's<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.420> million<00:03:14.660> other<00:03:14.840> possibilities

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
there's a million other possibilities

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.170 
there's a million other possibilities

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
with this capo so hopefully that would

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.540
