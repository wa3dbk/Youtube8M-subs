anyways<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.950> could<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.220> ascend<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
anyways you could just ascend and you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
anyways you could just ascend and you
could<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.479> fly<00:01:39.689> around<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> parachute

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
could just fly around with a parachute

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.440 
could just fly around with a parachute
and<00:01:40.890> once<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> learn<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.670> take<00:01:41.970> no<00:01:42.180> fall

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and once you learn you take no fall

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
and once you learn you take no fall
damage<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> parachute<00:01:43.890> mod

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
then you're gonna start ascending I'm
not<00:02:24.360> sure<00:02:24.540> how<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> parachute<00:02:25.290> starts<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
not sure how a parachute starts to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.560 
not sure how a parachute starts to
ascend<00:02:26.190> I'm<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.820> sure<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:27.240> that's<00:02:27.390> even

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
ascend I'm not sure if that's even

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.360 
ascend I'm not sure if that's even
possible<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.320> maybe<00:02:28.500> there<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> maybe<00:02:29.100> there

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
possible but maybe there is maybe there

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.920 
possible but maybe there is maybe there
is<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.490> way<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.970> ascend<00:02:30.330> with<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.660> parachute

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
is a way to ascend with a parachute

is a way to ascend with a parachute
maybe<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.710> catch<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> super

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
maybe you have to catch like a super

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.070 
maybe you have to catch like a super
Goodwin<00:02:32.730> current<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.570> you'll<00:02:33.780> take<00:02:33.960> you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
Goodwin current and you'll take you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600 
Goodwin current and you'll take you
straight<00:02:34.410> up<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.710> space<00:02:34.950> I'm<00:02:35.190> not<00:02:35.340> even<00:02:35.400> sure

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
straight up to space I'm not even sure

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.490 
straight up to space I'm not even sure
how<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.940> works<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.810> now<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.230> time<00:02:37.470> I
