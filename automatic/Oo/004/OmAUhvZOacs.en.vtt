00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.030
 a face looking great and we're going to 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.340
 start for dry skin we need the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.350
 following ingredients a bar 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.179
 bitter chocolate one tablespoon of oil 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.700
 of almonds and if you do not have it you can 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.530
 use olive oil and this we are going to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.909
 start cleaning our entire face and not 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.470
 we have to have a little bit of 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.010
 makeup for this to work very 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.080
 well then I started making up 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.000
 when you put makeup on your eyes oslo 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.000
 Be careful not to pull your eyelashes 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.519
 and the same removes very well and with 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.519
 Take care all your face 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.510
 vanish with the soap you use and 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.510
 wash your face correctly 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.680
 wash your face very well I already knew how to use 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.570
 exfoliant if you want me to teach you to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.030
 comments the exfoliant I put it in 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.780
 circulitos now let's do the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 mask 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.400
 let's do it in a water bath care 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.520
 that there is not a drop of water left in the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.230
 small container we already did a little 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.370
 of chocolate this to have an account 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.370
 amount you want to make 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.430
 and ready now I put everything in a 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.739
 container 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.019
 and we add the teaspoon of oil 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 of almonds if you do not have oil 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.849
 olive and mix everything very well 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.439
 with a brush or your super clean fingers 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.439
 for not wearing your neck 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 in truth this is my favorite and it 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.000
 feels super rich and your face is left 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.000
 super cute super super 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.750
 leave it on your face for 15 to 25 minutes and 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.980
 the mask and all this I recommend you 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 do it once a month 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.660
 look 15 days here I could finish but to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.730
 I like to remove the mask very 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.980
 well with warm water and what 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.380
 about 9 can remove a lot of cotton is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 with water and clean as much as you can 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.640
 I collided with my face and took a 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.380
 vitamin d capsule as if it were another 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.170
 mask I put it on and I leave it there 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.030
 half an hour really the skin is left 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.980
 beautiful and I'm not exaggerating if you have 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.200
 oily skin can also be this 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.180
 once in a while he finally praised my face 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.340
 already with soap everything normal the water the most 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.370
 as cold as you can, it cools with your cream 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.410
 moisturizing and ready you have oily skin or 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.410
 with granites we need the following 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.420
 oatmeal ingredients natural yogurt a little 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.080
 play carrot and olive oil 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.030
 I put a bit of carrot a lemon 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.590
 the amounts are not exact so no 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.510
 you worry I do not think it's done 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.600
 we need lemon but it's super 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.600
 important 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:30.639
 a spoonful of sand 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.860
 and one of natural yogurt to be mixed 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.409
 all very very good and ready 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.530
 we have to put it in our face for 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.150
 about 20 minutes so that your eyes will 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.460
 relax or be part of the dark circles 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.689
 It can be a normal rate of hot tea 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.639
 it can be chamomile or anabel is 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.379
 Now we have to take out the packages that 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.299
 also the rate in getting them to the 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.969
 freezer until they are super cold 

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:57.649
 as cold as you can the idea is 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.179
 that you relax a lot and that the 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:01.939
 packets that stay in place 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:03.709
 lie down at the end of your face with 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.259
 cold water and a special soap for your 

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:09.079
 skin type then to an ice for all your 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.719
 face to close the pores and ready 

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:13.729
 and that he watches us tell it because he tells us 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.889
 that we go up in our face and 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.839
 We look to see clearly is that I study 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.830
 a degree in medicine and that 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:22.110
 title backs me up 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.890
 it's not true but in truth if it puts me 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.780
 mediate for example bitter chocolate 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.000
 net and from super soft skin and 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.460
 Apart it has antioxidants improves the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.810
 circulation and reduces inflammation to 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.390
 mind you can put it if you have 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.970
 cellulite in the booties or where there is 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.980
 in the vein helps reduce dirt and 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.710
 waste left on the boards 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.140
 also prevents dehydration the book 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.850
 is a powerful exfoliant in which the 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.190
 party helps us to reduce 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.590
 dark spots or spots that you have 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.460
 given the pimples and also kills some 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.470
 mushrooms 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.990
 in a nutshell it has properties 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.700
 disinfectants and you close the pores the 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.530
 carrot 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.110
 very scientific but I have to tell you 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.200
 is to go on beta-carotene at your level and 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.720
 meditate of course that they are not and oxidants and 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.130
 fight with aging and apart 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.130
 it protects us against lightning 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.260

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.630
