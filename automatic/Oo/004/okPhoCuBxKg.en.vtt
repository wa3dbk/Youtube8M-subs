00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.440
 through 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.419
 Wednesday evening stands for packs for the competition 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.689
 played at home against sc cambuur in leeuwarden after a long preparation 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.449
 it was also time for a chance to start again 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.019
 the new one preparation whole preparation because you prepare for it 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.050
 street the start of the competition 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.449
 and in and start then it is in me and conditionally everyone gets the 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.769
 chance to get used to the way of playing football 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.180
 for no one else to become narrower than that competition must begin but yes 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.990
 need some extra patience there 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.700
 after the ball the understanding but it is now high time for me to really 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.950
 of the points to start saving condition that has been and he 8 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.040
 and that a number of weeks have subject explosions falls so far 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.240
 Yes very good 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.910
 easily taken care of and groups and yes 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.530
 for count down the possible mac and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.950
 word says it all that is important and more in the competition 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.770
 for dirk marcellis his first official match was in the shirt of 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.800
 pec zwolle 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.090
 the defender who played for seasons for nac breda has to get used to it 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.810
 the different compositions at the heart of defense 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.090
 well new less new young players always and again 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.200
 Accusing everything happened to the club as fresh bread with be sure 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.610
 to set a new guys 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 yes it took some getting used to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.680
 well we are ready for we have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.250
 trained a lot 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.190
 how much we want will certainly be granted at least 8 and have to go further tomorrow 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.180
 out for questioning 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.560
 this whole preparation also involved in the first game with cambuur de 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.950
 opponent 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 let the minister prepare it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.119
 I am eager to reach this enthusiastic team and how 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.210
 yes the last few weeks possible b some other trains 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.010
 We have been very busy there because of the preparation 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.720
 actually went very smoothly, say week five and then it started 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.230
 first dordtse sold and there he was making is an appropriate icon 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.240
 mnm so that she goes to vvv were all there 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.860
 their the smaller aardenburg genes the governance between arose and yet must 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380
 so now it is not there now 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.540
 there have been many more things with our own team and that too 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.989
 yes to still get the players 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.030
 And on top of that, if you only focus on Cambuur, there are 34 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.130
 competitions and the next two days later the chance of doing so 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.200
 He doesn't care for one thing 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.300
 because of the strike, the ron jans team goes several days longer 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.770
 to prepare for the game against sc cambuur a big advantage 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.029
 considering the last practice game against VVV Venlo 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.899
 well it has been an advantage on the bart pitch and stef nijland 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.239
 are already sitting on the couch and he had not made it on Saturday so that is earlier 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.289
 an advantage in 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:43.609
 also you can get a well i am assuming that sony multiple from ajax now again 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.669
 attracted 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.059
 it the game judge this so were three extra players on the couch and that 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.059
 is that it feels a lot better because otherwise the band was already whole 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.169
 yes been a man 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.639
 just watch tomorrow's game 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.240
 well i am curious about churches in the goal 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.460
 Well it can take the Nabil Sandd to look for what says a lot of new ones 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.520
 are boys 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.140
 animals share to make a debut in the premier league so yes that is always 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.540
 wait and see how it goes but I am curious about the sequel he comes 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.640
 so I can actually do what they went in with the new players 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.649
 a specific but the game concept is the same 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.089
 and 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.619
 speeds on the flanks and we are not yet sure if us can start in Asia and 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.520
 but if you look at it 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.050
 Den Bosch literally lives a speed and puts one the strikers who score a goal 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.860
 can make those own sites in the sixteen 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.550
 and dangerous in the sixteen I have I say little actually turned into the 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.689
 leader of the team all the way in building backwards 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.889
 the keeper also greets you 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.489
 NS also wants to put pressure on the build-up of the opponents I expect 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.829
 moral 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.680
 a nice competition that maybe the pace is faster than the actual one 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.969
 that the that is possible but 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.009
 you often get that in his first competition match 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.310
 after the departure of Jasper Dost and it was his job 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.920
 it is up to the other players to fill in the space in midfield 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.139
 opportunities for boys like erik dekker and wouter marinus 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.549
 Dick Dekker and what the navies of last year almost only lies in it 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.439
 first team a lot of wonderfully played exclusively in the promises 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.019
 and who have been attracted to actually a really a back 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.530
 just be able to do wonders for the places and after the chance that is very big 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.530
 who can go straight to work until that morning and 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.219
 and then there is better to see if they have learned anything in that season 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.069
 think it is enough 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.689
 yes that I do not know but they go like the fire department and 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.050
 that is constantly in it 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.199
 well i i i expect the last weeks psv there is one 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.689
 well if you could always it is never nice never easy and play 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.449
 yes we need a species that stays that way
