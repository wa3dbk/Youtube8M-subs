00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.829
 there the capri 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.780
 bernini not chronologically im 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.239
 difficulty level are arranged 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.840
 but quite different patterns too 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.949
 demonstrate 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.649
 I would really start it first 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.530
 take the so-called lighter ones 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.250
 as there would be the number 13 as there 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.899
 also the number 14 maybe 15 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.180
 also the number 20 is always recommended 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.449
 good as an entry afterwards 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.530
 maybe the number 9 and then 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.810
 I assert the field is so far 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 opened for all other caprices as 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.820
 It is then a very individual process 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.820
 being a student 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.490
 when you have the performance 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.150
 ranis knows I have almost all of them 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.490
 in faksimile from at my home and 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.170
 then you see very clearly with what he 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.730
 has publicly addressed and at 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.460
 which places and when and how exactly 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.580
 but it's not even a cafÃ© jetta 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.020
 So at the Caprices never played 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.270
 in public that me too 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.810
 interesting in titz he has it for the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.810
 written to others 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.740
 it is interesting that 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.430
 first caprice in e major that we have here 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 actually with a multiply 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.530
 do make have one hand it is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:17.610
 a barrio lashes when you go to paganini 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.290
 the guitarist wants to think mario haas 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:27.000
 Translated to soon over four pages so 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.770
 it is a very realistic etude then 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.190
 Interestingly, one also counts 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
 paganini almost cliched with one 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.190
 fast pace 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.520
 and that's not at all 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.330
 Given we have an andante it is 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.460
 go and nothing more than that and that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.950
 is also thought of relatively reasonable by 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.680
 you hardly expect what then 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.680
 everything comes, for example, chronic 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.890
 test runs down that one should now 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.350
 do not have to play in other tempi 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.390
 and there I always put in my own game 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.810
 as well as in teaching worth it 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.489
 that common tempo mars has to be found 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.060
 be and that is just then 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.570
 amazingly, a real one 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.410
 andante with care such a piece eg 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.530
 to practice 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.709
 then they are almost as a metronome function 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.080
 my legs and then i can see how 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.700
 then internet was still working 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.800
 something to be louder 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.220
 difficulties first time does not come 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.980
 the piece begins in tactical that is 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:41.760
 it starts with the 2 so we have the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:44.880
 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 which also musically 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.420
 To express completely different is in fact 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.350
 is the serious one that once counted on the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.230
 harmoniously so to speak spicy side and 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.760
 the two on the relaxed doing that 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.590
 much more sense than if you were from 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.260
 in the beginning with an exaggerated 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.570
 fast tempo and accent starts around 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 a highly athletic performance, so to speak 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.170
 submitted 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.940
 it is not there at all 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.210
 and not mentioned 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.210
 pen 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.310
 just the tactical 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.960
 this is based on the mentioned caprice 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.199
 especially important to me why 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.629
 accent in the first smear actually 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.780
 it would be very harmful to him 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:34.199
 avoid summer at the bottom 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.199
 to begin 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.629
 basically always make that clear 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.699
 this bassline and now we arrive 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.860
 an almost neuralgic point 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.690
 Of course, that is always the case 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.229
 Problem is optionally stroked art that soon 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.300
 How can I learn how to do that? 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.509
 convey 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.550
 My topic here is not the smear 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.819
 to overstate the impulse 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.430
 already due to the wrong accents 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:17.530
 but even spread the whole thing 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:24.430
 that is beginning with this technology I 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:27.460
 I have a double effect 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.650
 I can practice the one hand 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.800
 give the necessary momentum 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.199
 on that really up to eight note if 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.240
 you jumped the whole phase counts 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.710
 will be without accent 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.750
 but also the coordination of the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.810
 lower two notes that meet there 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.990
 in buzz minutes is practiced clearly with 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.630
 So it's a coordination exercise 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:56.789
 between left and right hand 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.789
 with answers if I only pay attention 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.590
 me as a musician 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.020
 wrestle untreated untreated 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.370
 information 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.430
 that's why covered issues are so 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.590
 much because what I'm doing in this 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.570
 was pulling out what my 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.590
 personal also owns artist 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.810
 it can become a surrogate 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.620
 yes, the publisher does not decide 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.460
 gives me a quasi first 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.460
 glasses-free view of the things
