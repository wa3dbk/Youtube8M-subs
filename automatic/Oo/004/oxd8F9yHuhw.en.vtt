00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.830
 today we are going to make a design of 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.830
 chessboard nails 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.340
 or beauty today we are going to do 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.510
 a chessboard design 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.690
 monochromatic or racing flag 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.690
 automotive 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.450
 Enamel dryer you go to bulldozer 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.540
 varnishes enamels in black white tone 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.960
 micro tape x scissors brush or glasses 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.270
 or ornaments acetone encapsulates dorna art e 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.610
 swabs let's see a layer of the base 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.620
 bulldozer and then we're going to give two 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.620
 varnish layers your white enamel 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.640
 to speed up the drying process we go 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 to occupy this enamel dryer and giving 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.140
 a layer on each of the nails 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.790
 when they have dried we will start with 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.940
 our girls design we are going to occupy the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.920
 micro tape x let's cut strips the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.820
 which are we going to put on the nail and we're going 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 to give a layer of enamel in black 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 the tapes or strips must be of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.210
 size of the pictures we want 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 our design 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 already having all the ribbons cut 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.800
 let's put a ribbon in the middle of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.450
 the nail vertically and two tapes to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.450
 the sides horizontally 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 in the spaces that manage to see there is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.620
 where we are going to place the varnish in tone 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.680
 black and that's how it's going to be forming 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.100
 the squares girls 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.509
 Now we are going to remove the strips with this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.330
 hair removal and it's very easy 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.239
 it does not matter that we have spots 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.010
 we are going to withdraw later now we are going to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.720
 do faster to see what it is 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.599
 super easy to make the design 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.849
 we will place in the three signs of the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:29.370
 that the simple ones are too much for us 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.920
 and we are going to paint with the black varnish a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.460
 Once the three girls that we have painted 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.360
 we are going to withdraw 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.750
 the bandages again 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.960
 and it's very practical girls very easy to 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.960
 do 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.020
 now we are going to do it in the other 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.020
 hand 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.920
 if you do not have a pillar clamp 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.530
 they can also do it with their fingers and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.710
 which is very easy and the simple ones or 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.870
 runs are a bit long so that from 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.200
 there we can take them and remove more 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.629
 easy 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.090
 we already have the design of the two hands 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.400
 now let's start doing the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.769
 pictures I'm using this nail art 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.769
 in black tone but if you do not have 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.830
 they can also occupy a brush and varnish 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.660
 black setting to make the pictures 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.819
 but I advise you to always have 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.060
 at hand an art the truth is very 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.350
 practical and very easy to use only 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.510
 you have to design 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.510
 and press a little to fill 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.050
 Now I'm going to take a cotton swab and acetone or 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.180
 nail polish remover and I will remove the excesses 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.480
 of varnish that have remained in the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.480
 fingers 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.800
 I decided to place these glitter or 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.360
 crystals 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.880
 to give it a more beautiful touch and more 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.590
 shiny if you do not have subscribers or 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.180
 you can not get them you can take any 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.459
 ornament 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.230
 finally we passed a layer of 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.940
 encapsulated if you do not have it too 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.850
 you can occupy brightness and that's how we 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.320
 it is if you liked it dale I like it 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.240
 share it with favorites and most 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.590
