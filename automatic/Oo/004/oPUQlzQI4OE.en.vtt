stuff<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.879> point<00:00:53.879> 24<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.329> rushed<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:55.559> don't

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
stuff so point 24 was rushed and i don't

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
stuff so point 24 was rushed and i don't

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think it was feature complete and the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.299 
think it was feature complete and the
nasa<00:00:58.020> mission<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.129> just

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
nasa mission one was well it was just

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.689 
nasa mission one was well it was just
ask<00:00:59.489> rose<00:00:59.699> um<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.190> had<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
ask rose um so we have had a bit of a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
ask rose um so we have had a bit of a
fall<00:01:02.940> behind<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.510> terms<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.870> updates<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.589> i

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
fall behind in terms of updates and i

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050
