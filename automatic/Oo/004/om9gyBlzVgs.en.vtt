00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.020
 which are more healthy fresh vegetables or 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.329
 the frozen vegetables this is a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 question that many people addicted to 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:15.239
 take vegetables and take fruits because they 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220
 have they ever done they really are not 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:20.369
 so harmful the vegetables 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.099
 frozen that is what is true and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.679
 what is it that is not true then today 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.509
 I come to reveal it in this video 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.480
 vegetables that we call as 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.550
 Fresh vegetables are not really so 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 good as we thought in the first place 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 because those vegetables actually carry 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 many days sorting and good at 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.250
 classification and in transport with what 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 which must be added the days of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.860
 classification the days of transport and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.060
 the days he stays in the store with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.450
 which of freshness 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.610
 there is nothing if we consider the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.970
 changes in temperature and light that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.710
 been in the trip of that product then 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.890
 we find that most of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 fresh vegetables are not fresh but 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.050
 they are vegetables that have lost 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.909
 part of vitamin c and folates with 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.070
 which are not as beneficial as 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.229
 you thought, however, the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.840
 advantage of frozen vegetables is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.090
 that when freezing they are capable of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.910
 keep all its properties all 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.880
 the vitamins and benefits that they have 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.670
 the vegetables are preserved if they are frozen 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.610
 the only snag of frozen vegetables 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.210
 is that they usually add salt 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.910
 add preservative additives and you have to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.550
 assess if it really makes up for eating a 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.550
 frozen vegetable because apart from having 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.700
 these additives and these added fats 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.219
 they usually know much worse 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.530
 however, I already say that as a 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.049
 vitamins will always have more one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 vitamin that has been frozen that a 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.009
 that has been circulating for several days 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.649
 salvation for all these people who 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.970
 They want to eat healthy and it's 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.510
 that you take the fruit for nothing else 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.310
 just take the one from the garden eat it 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.190
 because it is at that moment when he keeps 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.920
 all intact properties intact 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.170
 all the beneficial properties 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.450
 vitamins and others and not also entails 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 no danger of fat consumption 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.660
 saturated with carcinogenic preservatives and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.360
 my advice is that whenever 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.130
 you can buy within what there is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.950
 coolest possible 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.260
 And if not, you already know that the vegetables 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.870
 frozen can also be another 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.630
 alternative as long as you watch that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.160
 do not carry too many preservatives and that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.160
 be kept in good condition
