00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.730
 friends all hello welcome to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.330
 channel game dota 2 and some 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 feature 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.519
 ulti lich well as we know now here 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 After repair the data changes in the ultimates in 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.119
 chain growth means rebound removed 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 from the goal that is if we have amanim 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 the ulta licha just flies endlessly 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.239
 so where is he supposed to take off 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.690
 understandably where is the clip from 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 magically immune this is our old 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.149
 Good endings I mean you run like 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.899
 support 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.190
 help your carry there to play 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 put wards and so on and you can 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.629
 make on it also here such 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 interesting trap here i have 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.160
 whipping boy 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:03.310
 let's see what happens then we run 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:08.350
 ult second 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:12.150
 so let's write a professional proflesh 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.150
 run another one there 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:28.380
 so what is the refresh we will run again 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 one refresh and last 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.440
 like this 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:44.090
 so how many of them there have no idea well 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.340
 stuff 4 flies in my one maybe 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.320
 gone and so well and they will be there 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.220
 infinitely like this we have 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.450
 trap well let's go about 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.790
 experimenting how something will turn out 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 happen with this here antimag me 16 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.330
 level well such an interesting purchase 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.330
 so he jumped right there 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:26.090
 first blood well this is of course 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:28.190
 training such here it turned out 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.140
 infinitely not here flies so can 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.970
 be a trap guard but i'm shallow here 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 dragons killed only on them 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.010
 acts it turns out 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.710
 magic damage passes on all 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.270
 the rest is not, and so here you can 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.630
 there is on the stack 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.990
 and plus them still so protect say 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.160
 so well, of course, you lose 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.230
 ults for a while and cooldown when 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.230
 I refresh the game here and of course I registered but 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.740
 so here if you have time and play 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.900
 you can somehow try this 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.330
 make use of at least 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.180
 the enemy is always running past but it 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.360
 here he jumped over here that is if 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 someone will run over here here ult 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.110
 Of course it is not to dress well, 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:26.320
 You can try to create the hero 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:28.730
 let's say a pig like that with us 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.900
 how close should he run 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.560
 to act on it 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.300
 go yes that's almost point blank 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.090
 there is a cross over here this line up 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.040
 zip on the action here is such an interesting 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.610
 feature we do n't know can someone 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.080
 it may come in handy but for fan 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:57.190
 infinitely possible to someone 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.530
 will it be like that to arrange such a trap 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.120
 well thank you all for watching 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 Good luck in the game 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.030
 Good luck!
