00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
episode of a redstone in three or less

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.680 
episode of a redstone in three or less
today<00:00:07.410> I've<00:00:07.529> got<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.710> very<00:00:08.250> simple<00:00:08.970> slime<00:00:09.420> block

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
today I've got a very simple slime block

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.660 
today I've got a very simple slime block
elevator<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:11.250> stand<00:00:11.460> right<00:00:11.550> here

elevator for you just stand right here

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.820 
elevator for you just stand right here
in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> slime<00:00:12.090> block<00:00:12.269> hit<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> button<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.219> oh

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
in the slime block hit the button and oh

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
in the slime block hit the button and oh
yeah<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> super<00:00:17.970> simple<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.050> easy

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
yeah it's like a super simple and easy

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.810 
yeah it's like a super simple and easy
to<00:00:19.710> build<00:00:19.949> let's<00:00:20.670> go<00:00:20.910> get<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.510> into<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.820> so

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
to build let's go get right into it so

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.550 
to build let's go get right into it so
to<00:00:23.880> start<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.570> need<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> little<00:00:25.230> platform

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
to start out you need a little platform

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
to start out you need a little platform
just<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.609> three<00:00:26.970> by<00:00:27.119> three<00:00:27.510> these

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
just like this three by three these

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
just like this three by three these
blocks<00:00:28.560> right<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.789> kind

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
blocks right here have to be some kind

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
blocks right here have to be some kind
of<00:00:30.119> unmovable<00:00:30.869> block<00:00:31.080> something<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
of unmovable block something that a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250 
of unmovable block something that a
slime<00:00:32.399> block<00:00:32.730> can't<00:00:33.149> stick<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> move

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
slime block can't stick on to and move

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
slime block can't stick on to and move
around<00:00:34.380> otherwise<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.160> won't<00:00:35.579> work<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.360> now

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
around otherwise it won't work so now

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.450 
around otherwise it won't work so now
you're<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> put<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.500> sticky<00:00:38.100> piston

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you're just going to put a sticky piston

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.630 
you're just going to put a sticky piston
right<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> slime<00:00:40.980> block<00:00:41.280> right

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
right here with the slime block right

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.979 
right here with the slime block right
there<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> i'm<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> build<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
there and i'm just going to build this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.529 
there and i'm just going to build this
platform<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
platform out a little bit and put a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
platform out a little bit and put a
button<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.149> what's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
button just like that that is what's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
button just like that that is what's
going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> actually<00:00:48.750> catapult<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.160> into

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
going to actually catapult you up into

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.260 
going to actually catapult you up into
the<00:00:51.059> air<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.469> space<00:00:53.010> down<00:00:53.399> below<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the air so one space down below that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.900 
the air so one space down below that
ball<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.210> redstone<00:00:57.719> dust<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.910> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
ball in you need a redstone dust and a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.950 
ball in you need a redstone dust and a
repeater<00:01:00.270> coming<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> block<00:01:02.960> into

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
repeater coming out of that block into

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200 
repeater coming out of that block into
another<00:01:04.350> block<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.860> block<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.280> right

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
another block the block that's right

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
another block the block that's right
adjacent<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.320> sticky<00:01:07.710> piston<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.220> when

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
adjacent to that sticky piston now when

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
adjacent to that sticky piston now when
you<00:01:08.580> hit<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> button<00:01:09.030> boom<00:01:09.869> you'll<00:01:10.260> be

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you hit this button boom you'll be

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
you hit this button boom you'll be
catapulted<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.430> air<00:01:11.640> by<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.720> slime

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
catapulted into the air by this slime

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
catapulted into the air by this slime
block<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.400> platform<00:01:15.000> set

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
block now that you got your platform set

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.550 
block now that you got your platform set
up<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> build<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:15.990> fence

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
up I like to build this little fence

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
up I like to build this little fence
cage<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> looks<00:01:18.030> cool

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
cage one because I think it looks cool

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.060 
cage one because I think it looks cool
and<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.229> an<00:01:19.380> important<00:01:19.830> reason

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and it actually has an important reason

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.149 
and it actually has an important reason
which<00:01:20.400> I'll<00:01:20.610> explain<00:01:20.790> later<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:22.100> now<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
which I'll explain later but now you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.749 
which I'll explain later but now you
need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> count<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.530> three<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:26.340> five

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
need to count one two three four five

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
need to count one two three four five
blocks<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.689> from<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.439> slime<00:01:28.710> level<00:01:29.220> put<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
blocks up from the slime level put a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
blocks up from the slime level put a
pressure<00:01:29.640> plate<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.150> top<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.020> can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
pressure plate on top of here you can

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
pressure plate on top of here you can
get<00:01:31.259> rid<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> rest<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.890> these<00:01:31.979> fence<00:01:32.310> posts

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
get rid of the rest of these fence posts

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
get rid of the rest of these fence posts
and<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.570> directly<00:01:33.930> adjacent<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and now just directly adjacent to that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.580 
and now just directly adjacent to that
two<00:01:35.250> blocks<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.320> easy

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
two blocks like this this is so easy

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
two blocks like this this is so easy
guys<00:01:37.920> repeater<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> delay<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> two<00:01:39.479> into

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
guys repeater with a delay of two into

guys repeater with a delay of two into
that<00:01:40.470> sticky<00:01:40.890> piston<00:01:41.340> facing<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.850> sticky

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that sticky piston facing in sticky

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.889 
that sticky piston facing in sticky
payson<00:01:42.990> piston<00:01:43.560> facing<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.659> that's<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
payson piston facing up and that's it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.539 
payson piston facing up and that's it
you're<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.229> done<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> add

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you're about done but I just like to add

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.219 
you're about done but I just like to add
an<00:01:47.759> unmovable<00:01:48.149> block<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.750> because

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
an unmovable block right here because

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.710 
an unmovable block right here because
occasionally<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.280> spits<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.270> it'll

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
occasionally when this spits out it'll

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
occasionally when this spits out it'll
push<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> sideways<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> course<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
push you sideways which of course you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910 
push you sideways which of course you
don't<00:01:53.640> want<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.259> importance<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> having

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
don't want so the importance of having

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130 
don't want so the importance of having
this<00:01:56.460> fence<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.780> can't<00:01:57.990> be

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this fence here is because you can't be

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
this fence here is because you can't be
right<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> middle<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> sticky<00:01:59.909> block

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
right in the middle of the sticky block

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.700 
right in the middle of the sticky block
otherwise<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.049> go<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.380> won't

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
otherwise when you go up you won't

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.639 
otherwise when you go up you won't
actually<00:02:01.890> trigger<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.990> push<00:02:03.990> play<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
actually trigger that push play to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
actually trigger that push play to
actually<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.570> circuit<00:02:07.140> go

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
actually have that have that circuit go

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
actually have that have that circuit go
so<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.590> kind<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:09.090> up

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so you kind of have to be right up

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.089 
so you kind of have to be right up
against<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.720> back<00:02:10.020> fence<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.649> between<00:02:10.979> these

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
against this back fence in between these

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.350 
against this back fence in between these
two<00:02:11.310> blocks<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.819> when<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.000> push<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> button

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
two blocks so when you push the button

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.220 
two blocks so when you push the button
you<00:02:12.780> hit<00:02:12.959> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you hit that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.520 
you hit that
pressure<00:02:13.470> plate<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.120> go<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.319> is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
pressure plate and go on up and this is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.789 
pressure plate and go on up and this is
safe<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.690> normal<00:02:18.690> survival<00:02:19.049> mode<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.620> just

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
safe in normal survival mode you just

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.289 
safe in normal survival mode you just
have<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> make<00:02:20.159> sure<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.549> land<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
middle of that sticky block right there

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.309 
middle of that sticky block right there
