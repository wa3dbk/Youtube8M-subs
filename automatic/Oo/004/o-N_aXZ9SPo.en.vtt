00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.080 
appreciate what to do and how hard it is
actually<00:04:16.709> compared<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:18.130> just<00:04:18.519> watching<00:04:18.970> it

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
actually compared to just watching it

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.950 
actually compared to just watching it
and<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:21.130> think<00:04:21.820> more<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.180> more<00:04:22.270> people<00:04:22.390> are

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
and I think more and more people are

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.280 
and I think more and more people are
trying<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.620> make<00:04:23.800> stop<00:04:24.040> motions<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.290> think

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
trying to make stop motions so I think

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.910 
trying to make stop motions so I think
if<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.890> did<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.130> you'd<00:04:27.820> realize<00:04:28.650> how<00:04:29.650> hard

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
if you did that you'd realize how hard

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.210 
if you did that you'd realize how hard
