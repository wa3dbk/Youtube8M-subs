going to mention early on as the fact
that<00:02:26.020> we're<00:02:26.200> making<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.740> much<00:02:26.920> easier<00:02:27.160> for

spectators to get the tickets we've
we've<00:02:29.890> brought<00:02:30.100> Computicket<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.850> board<00:02:31.060> which

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
we've brought Computicket on board which

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.120 
we've brought Computicket on board which
is<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> streamline<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.710> many<00:02:32.920> things

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
is going to streamline so many things

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.710 
is going to streamline so many things
happening<00:02:33.400> at<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.640> gate<00:02:33.790> specifically<00:02:34.360> yes

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
happening at the gate specifically yes

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.670 
happening at the gate specifically yes
because<00:02:34.960> that's<00:02:35.110> where<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> lot<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.380> congestion

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680

because that's where a lot of congestion
was<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.130> past<00:02:36.340> people<00:02:36.490> would<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.820> all

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
was in the past people would be all

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.490 
was in the past people would be all
there<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.510> gates<00:02:37.720> buying<00:02:38.050> tickets<00:02:38.380> and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
Q's with run all the way down the main

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.220 
Q's with run all the way down the main
road<00:02:39.670> yes<00:02:40.240> exactly<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.020> would

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
road yes exactly that but I would

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.330 
road yes exactly that but I would
computicket<00:02:41.740> coming<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.070> board<00:02:42.190> it's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
computicket coming on board it's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.190 
computicket coming on board it's
streamlining<00:02:42.790> lots<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.210> those<00:02:43.300> things<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.140> if

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
yet you need to get it at computicket

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
yet you need to get it at computicket
that's<00:02:47.290> gonna<00:02:47.410> make<00:02:47.590> your<00:02:47.770> life<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.070> much

easier when you get to the gate

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.840 
easier when you get to the gate
