survey<00:00:12.660> solutions<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.890> this<00:00:14.040> webcast<00:00:14.280> we're

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
survey solutions in this webcast we're

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.339 
survey solutions in this webcast we're
going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.000> look<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.269> options<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.930> share<00:00:16.139> data

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
going to look at options to share data

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.279 
going to look at options to share data
between<00:00:16.650> advanced<00:00:17.160> road<00:00:17.430> sign<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.110> infra<00:00:19.110> wax

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
between advanced road sign and infra wax

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
between advanced road sign and infra wax
you<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> model<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.090> advanced

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you can see here a model in advanced

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.779 
you can see here a model in advanced
road<00:00:21.690> design<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.770> we're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.520> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
road design what we're going to do is to

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.730 
road design what we're going to do is to
create<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> civil<00:00:24.449> 3d<00:00:24.570> surface<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.410> model

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
create a civil 3d surface for that model

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.609 
create a civil 3d surface for that model
and<00:00:26.420> after<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.900> we'll<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and after that what we'll do is to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.299 
and after that what we'll do is to
create<00:00:28.980> some<00:00:29.430> areas<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.590> different<00:00:31.590> rendering

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
create some areas of different rendering

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
create some areas of different rendering
that<00:00:32.519> we<00:00:32.669> want<00:00:32.879> to<00:00:33.000> go<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.390> influence<00:00:33.980> so

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that we want to go off to influence so

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.340 
that we want to go off to influence so
the<00:00:35.489> process<00:00:35.910> we're<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the process we're going to use is to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.130 
the process we're going to use is to
actually<00:00:37.500> create<00:00:37.829> 3d<00:00:38.430> faces<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> each

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
actually create 3d faces of each

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.090 
actually create 3d faces of each
material<00:00:41.070> type<00:00:41.790> across<00:00:42.420> our<00:00:42.750> site<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.860> we're

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
material type across our site so we're

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
material type across our site so we're
now<00:00:44.280> exporting<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:45.540> 3d<00:00:46.079> faces<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
now exporting out 3d faces from the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.340 
now exporting out 3d faces from the
model<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> we'll<00:00:48.090> use<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> layer

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
model and we'll use this and the layer

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
model and we'll use this and the layer
discrimination<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> creates<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
discrimination it creates for the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
discrimination it creates for the
different<00:00:51.450> materials<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:53.010> out

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
different materials to actually get out

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.840 
different materials to actually get out
some<00:00:53.489> areas<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.899> technique<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
some areas this is one technique to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
some areas this is one technique to
actually<00:00:56.850> create<00:00:57.180> coverage<00:00:58.079> areas<00:00:58.469> back<00:00:58.710> into

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
actually create coverage areas back into

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
actually create coverage areas back into
influence<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> give<00:01:00.719> us

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
influence and that's going to give us

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720 
influence and that's going to give us
the<00:01:01.199> quality<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> presentation<00:01:02.610> we're

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the quality of presentation we're

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
the quality of presentation we're
looking<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> 3d<00:01:04.379> face<00:01:04.710> export<00:01:05.309> will

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
looking for so the 3d face export will

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
looking for so the 3d face export will
actually<00:01:05.939> export<00:01:06.450> our<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.810> two<00:01:07.079> different

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
actually export our on two different

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.010 
actually export our on two different
layers<00:01:07.619> based<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.399> materials<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.179> you<00:01:09.719> get<00:01:09.929> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
layers based on materials and you get to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.779 
layers based on materials and you get to
control<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.920> there's<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> file<00:01:11.459> where<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
control that so there's a file where you

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.959 
control that so there's a file where you
can<00:01:11.969> setup<00:01:12.209> code<00:01:13.049> pairs<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.490> materials

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
can setup code pairs and what materials

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.120 
can setup code pairs and what materials
should<00:01:15.060> output<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.079> what<00:01:16.920> we're<00:01:17.039> doing

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
should output from that what we're doing

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980 
should output from that what we're doing
now<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.399> going<00:01:17.789> through<00:01:18.029> a<00:01:18.060> process<00:01:18.329> of<00:01:18.779> taking

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now is going through a process of taking

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
now is going through a process of taking
each<00:01:19.349> material<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:20.219> starting<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.609> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
each material we're starting with the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.539 
each material we're starting with the
asphalt<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.840> converting<00:01:22.529> it<00:01:22.679> into<00:01:22.889> an

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
asphalt and converting it into an

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.330 
asphalt and converting it into an
outline<00:01:23.999> polyline<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.499> the<00:01:25.799> first<00:01:26.039> thing<00:01:26.219> we

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
outline polyline so the first thing we

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.629 
outline polyline so the first thing we
do<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.849> to<00:01:27.240> flatten<00:01:27.569> 3d<00:01:28.499> faces<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.549> we

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
do is to flatten 3d faces and then we

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.929 
do is to flatten 3d faces and then we
create<00:01:29.999> regions<00:01:30.779> around<00:01:31.380> those<00:01:31.950> 3d<00:01:32.219> faces<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
create regions around those 3d faces and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.510 
create regions around those 3d faces and
the<00:01:33.749> ultimate<00:01:34.349> goal<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.859> is<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.069> will

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the ultimate goal here is that will

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.849 
the ultimate goal here is that will
create<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> looped<00:01:36.270> region<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> goes<00:01:37.529> around

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
create a looped region that goes around

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.050 
create a looped region that goes around
the<00:01:38.189> extents<00:01:38.789> of<00:01:38.969> those<00:01:39.329> three<00:01:39.599> faces<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:41.880> then

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the extents of those three faces we then

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
the extents of those three faces we then
go<00:01:42.240> through<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> process<00:01:42.779> of<00:01:43.259> converting<00:01:43.799> that

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
go through a process of converting that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.629 
go through a process of converting that
outline<00:01:44.969> region<00:01:45.509> into<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.439> polyline<00:01:46.919> and<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
outline region into a polyline and it

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.989 
outline region into a polyline and it
simply<00:01:48.149> explode<00:01:49.219> polyline<00:01:50.219> edits<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.819> a

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
simply explode polyline edits and a

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.149 
simply explode polyline edits and a
joint<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.109> that's<00:01:52.349> what's<00:01:52.590> happening<00:01:52.950> now

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
joint so that's what's happening now

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.179 
joint so that's what's happening now
this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.969> one<00:01:54.179> technique<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.590> outlines

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
this is one technique to get outlines

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.519 
this is one technique to get outlines
from<00:01:56.639> advanced<00:01:57.029> road<00:01:57.299> design<00:01:57.569> another

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:58.529 
from advanced road design another

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:00.679 
from advanced road design another
technique<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.249> to<00:01:59.549> output<00:02:00.059> the<00:02:00.329> two

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
technique would be to output the two

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.889 
technique would be to output the two
deeper<00:02:00.989> lines<00:02:01.289> of<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:02.849> features<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.569> then

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
deeper lines of the features and then

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.150 
deeper lines of the features and then
join<00:02:04.200> those<00:02:04.380> together

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.920 

so<00:02:10.160> once<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.490> polyline<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:10.970> created<00:02:11.420> all<00:02:11.660> we

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
so once the polyline is created all we

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.450 
so once the polyline is created all we
really<00:02:12.080> need<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.410> do<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.800> export<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.340> out

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
really need to do is to export it out

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.210 
really need to do is to export it out
into<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.940> format<00:02:14.420> suitable<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.350> import<00:02:16.010> into

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
into a format suitable for import into

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.240 
into a format suitable for import into
infraworks<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.120> one<00:02:17.660> method<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.250> export

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
infraworks and one method is to export

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.350 
infraworks and one method is to export
out<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.510> Autodesk<00:02:20.930> SDF<00:02:21.620> file<00:02:25.360> creating

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
out to the Autodesk SDF file creating

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.900 
out to the Autodesk SDF file creating
SDF<00:02:27.050> files<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> great<00:02:27.950> technique<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.640> move

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
SDF files is a great technique to move

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.800 
SDF files is a great technique to move
data<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:30.020> infer<00:02:30.350> works<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.310> move

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
data to infer works so you can move

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.050 
data to infer works so you can move

for<00:02:35.270> roads<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:36.140> other<00:02:36.290> features<00:02:36.560> such<00:02:37.040> as

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
for roads and other features such as

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400 
for roads and other features such as
light<00:02:37.550> poles<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.240> sea<00:02:38.630> furniture<00:02:39.200> across

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
light poles and sea furniture across

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.940 
light poles and sea furniture across
using<00:02:39.650> SDF<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:41.090> final<00:02:41.450> phase<00:02:42.020> of<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.710> to

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
using SDF the final phase of this is to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.700 
using SDF the final phase of this is to
create<00:02:43.130> an<00:02:43.490> autodesk<00:02:44.120> amx<00:02:44.750> file<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
create an autodesk amx file and this is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.100 
create an autodesk amx file and this is
the<00:02:45.920> best<00:02:46.100> technique<00:02:46.580> for<00:02:47.000> exporting<00:02:47.930> out

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
the best technique for exporting out

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.970 
the best technique for exporting out
alignments<00:02:48.890> if<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.100> need<00:02:49.280> them<00:02:49.460> in<00:02:49.610> surfaces

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.230 

so<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.070> need<00:02:55.220> four<00:02:55.430> works<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:55.790> already<00:02:56.030> have

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
so we need four works we already have

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.270 
so we need four works we already have
some<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.990> existing<00:02:57.500> features<00:02:57.920> but<00:02:58.130> we're

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
some of the existing features but we're

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.390 
some of the existing features but we're
now<00:02:58.430> going<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.790> add<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.840> design<00:03:00.230> surface<00:03:00.530> so

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
now going to add the design surface so

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.150 
now going to add the design surface so
we<00:03:01.550> bring<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:01.970> IMX<00:03:02.750> file<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.380> inside

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
we bring in that IMX file and inside

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.670 
we bring in that IMX file and inside
that<00:03:04.190> IMX<00:03:04.790> file<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.360> select<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.200> we<00:03:06.290> want<00:03:06.530> to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
that IMX file we select that we want to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.550 
that IMX file we select that we want to
bring<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> surface<00:03:07.580> data<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.380> every<00:03:09.380> time

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
bring in the surface data and every time

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.440 
bring in the surface data and every time
you<00:03:09.710> bring<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.040> data<00:03:10.310> into<00:03:10.730> infraworks<00:03:11.060> you

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
you bring in data into infraworks you

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.060 
you bring in data into infraworks you
need<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.720> configure<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.739> just<00:03:12.890> need

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
need to configure it and you just need

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.310 
need to configure it and you just need
to<00:03:13.100> double<00:03:13.550> click<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.030> source<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:15.110> what

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
to double click on the source and what

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.100 
to double click on the source and what
we're<00:03:15.470> going<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.770> do<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.220> now<00:03:16.459> tell<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.720> omx

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
we're going to do is now tell the omx

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.550 
we're going to do is now tell the omx
file<00:03:18.410> exactly<00:03:19.250> what<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.550> want<00:03:19.790> out<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.209> that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
file exactly what we want out of that

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.110 
file exactly what we want out of that
stream<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.680> data<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.280> only<00:03:22.520> want<00:03:22.940> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
stream of data so we only want the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.600 
stream of data so we only want the
design<00:03:23.420> surface<00:03:23.750> as<00:03:24.620> soon<00:03:24.890> as<00:03:24.980> we<00:03:25.100> add<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
design surface as soon as we add that

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.540 
design surface as soon as we add that
and<00:03:25.910> configure<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.980> infraworks<00:03:27.980> will<00:03:28.430> now

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
and configure it in infraworks will now

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.449 
and configure it in infraworks will now
show<00:03:28.850> us<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.390> full<00:03:29.600> terrain<00:03:30.140> model<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:31.130> the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
show us the full terrain model of the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.270 
show us the full terrain model of the
design<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.390> see<00:03:32.660> if<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.680> look<00:03:33.890> at<00:03:34.070> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
design so you can see if you look at the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.430 
design so you can see if you look at the
shape<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.820> land<00:03:35.030> it's<00:03:35.239> been<00:03:35.390> adjusted<00:03:35.480> it's

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
shape the land it's been adjusted it's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.180 
shape the land it's been adjusted it's
very<00:03:36.709> clear<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.310> there<00:03:37.550> is<00:03:37.580> kerb<00:03:38.540> and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
very clear that there is kerb and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.030 
very clear that there is kerb and
pavement<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.430> footpath<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.890> batters<00:03:42.890> or

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
pavement and footpath and batters or

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.400 
pavement and footpath and batters or
daylights<00:03:43.459> in<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.120> system<00:03:44.480> what<00:03:45.080> we're<00:03:45.230> going

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
daylights in the system what we're going

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.900 
daylights in the system what we're going
to<00:03:45.500> do<00:03:45.590> now<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.190> go<00:03:46.310> through<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.610> process

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
to do now is to go through that process

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.650 
to do now is to go through that process
of<00:03:47.360> rendering<00:03:47.870> out<00:03:48.800> our<00:03:49.220> IRD<00:03:49.820> design<00:03:50.209> on<00:03:50.390> top

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
of rendering out our IRD design on top

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.990 
of rendering out our IRD design on top
and<00:03:51.200> we've<00:03:51.380> done<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.890> by<00:03:52.100> adding<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.489> SDF

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
and we've done that by adding the SDF

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.090 
and we've done that by adding the SDF
file<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.840> what<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.140> do<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.440> convert<00:03:54.620> each

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
file and what you do is you convert each

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.780 
file and what you do is you convert each
SDF<00:03:55.790> file<00:03:56.090> into<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:57.140> coverage<00:03:57.680> area<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
SDF file into a coverage area and the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.780 
SDF file into a coverage area and the
idea<00:03:59.150> here<00:03:59.540> is<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.989> apply<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.380> material

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
idea here is that you apply a material

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.449 
idea here is that you apply a material
that<00:04:01.790> suits<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.570> type<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.010> area<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.310> is

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
that suits that type of area so this is

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.040 
that suits that type of area so this is
pavement<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.120> we're<00:04:05.239> going<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.420> hop<00:04:05.600> in<00:04:05.840> and

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
pavement so we're going to hop in and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:19.909 
pavement so we're going to hop in and
assign<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:07.070> paper<00:04:07.459> material<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.420> area

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.760 

so<00:04:20.549> you'll<00:04:20.669> now<00:04:20.789> see<00:04:20.849> that<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.810> Ashfield<00:04:22.469> has

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
so you'll now see that the Ashfield has

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.730 
so you'll now see that the Ashfield has
been<00:04:23.009> rendered<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.849> to<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.389> correct<00:04:24.870> area<00:04:25.199> and

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
been rendered on to the correct area and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.290 
been rendered on to the correct area and
what<00:04:25.889> we<00:04:26.009> do<00:04:26.219> now<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.610> we<00:04:26.759> move<00:04:26.909> back<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
what we do now is we move back to the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.959 
what we do now is we move back to the
model<00:04:27.599> and<00:04:27.810> we'll<00:04:28.379> repeat<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.740> process<00:04:29.159> for

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 
model and we'll repeat that process for

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.089 
model and we'll repeat that process for
the<00:04:29.999> other<00:04:30.090> materials<00:04:30.779> so<00:04:31.560> what<00:04:31.830> we're<00:04:31.949> going

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
the other materials so what we're going

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.219 
the other materials so what we're going
to<00:04:32.189> do<00:04:32.370> now<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.939> isolate<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.659> curb<00:04:33.900> and

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
to do now is to isolate the curb and

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.499 
to do now is to isolate the curb and
we're<00:04:34.860> going<00:04:35.009> to<00:04:35.039> convert<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.699> into<00:04:36.210> a

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
we're going to convert that into a

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.290 
we're going to convert that into a
series<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:36.990> closed<00:04:37.560> polylines<00:04:38.129> for<00:04:39.060> the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
series of closed polylines for the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:50.809 
series of closed polylines for the
different<00:04:39.719> parts<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.319> curb<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:50.550> once<00:04:50.729> that

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
different parts of the curb so once that

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.209 
different parts of the curb so once that
file<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.419> outputted<00:04:51.990> same<00:04:52.500> process<00:04:52.949> back<00:04:53.189> in

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
file is outputted same process back in

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.839 
file is outputted same process back in
four<00:04:53.610> works<00:04:53.759> we<00:04:54.000> grab<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.479> SDF<00:04:55.409> file<00:04:55.849> to

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
four works we grab that SDF file to

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.610 
four works we grab that SDF file to
convert<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.330> into<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.569> coverage<00:04:57.960> area<00:04:58.349> and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
convert it into a coverage area and

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.350 
convert it into a coverage area and
assign<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.279> material<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.789> we'd<00:04:59.939> like<00:05:00.150> to

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
assign the material that we'd like to

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.010 
assign the material that we'd like to
have<00:05:01.789> what's<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.939> coverage<00:05:03.270> area<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.689> at<00:05:03.840> it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
have what's the coverage area is at it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.619 
have what's the coverage area is at it
if<00:05:04.289> it's<00:05:04.500> not<00:05:04.680> displaying<00:05:05.009> simply<00:05:05.879> change<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
if it's not displaying simply change the

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.200 
if it's not displaying simply change the
layer<00:05:07.409> order<00:05:07.740> in<00:05:08.069> terms<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.759> display<00:05:09.180> of

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
layer order in terms of display of

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.260 
layer order in terms of display of
coverage<00:05:09.659> areas<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.289> you'll<00:05:10.889> see<00:05:11.069> the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
coverage areas and you'll see the

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.920 
coverage areas and you'll see the
material<00:05:12.270> show

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.350 

now<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.590> same<00:05:19.919> process<00:05:20.430> is<00:05:20.610> repeated<00:05:20.759> for<00:05:21.120> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
now the same process is repeated for the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:48.220 
now the same process is repeated for the
different<00:05:21.720> materials

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.800 

so<00:05:48.830> what<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.070> can<00:05:49.190> see<00:05:49.400> now<00:05:49.610> is<00:05:49.850> that<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.270> full

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
so what you can see now is that the full

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.020 
so what you can see now is that the full
advanced<00:05:51.530> road<00:05:51.770> design<00:05:52.040> model<00:05:52.400> has<00:05:52.550> now<00:05:52.730> been

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
advanced road design model has now been

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.020 
advanced road design model has now been
moved<00:05:53.240> across<00:05:53.600> into<00:05:54.290> infraworks<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:55.820> can

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
moved across into infraworks and you can

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.650 
moved across into infraworks and you can
now<00:05:56.210> from<00:05:56.480> here<00:05:56.690> create<00:05:57.020> still<00:05:57.980> shots<00:05:58.660> check

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
now from here create still shots check

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.220 
now from here create still shots check
shadow<00:05:59.900> casting<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:01.040> also<00:06:01.400> create

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
shadow casting and also create

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.680 
shadow casting and also create
animations<00:06:03.230> via<00:06:03.980> the<00:06:04.340> storyboard<00:06:04.910> tools<00:06:05.210> it's

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
animations via the storyboard tools it's

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.050 
animations via the storyboard tools it's
item<00:06:05.960> influence<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:07.190> we<00:06:07.310> are<00:06:07.430> going<00:06:07.760> to<00:06:07.880> run<00:06:08.030> a

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
item influence and we are going to run a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.360 
item influence and we are going to run a
storyboard<00:06:08.690> now<00:06:09.320> just<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.950> can<00:06:10.130> see<00:06:10.340> a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
storyboard now just you can see a

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.300 
storyboard now just you can see a
visualization<00:06:11.530> down<00:06:12.530> through<00:06:12.800> this<00:06:12.920> design

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
visualization down through this design

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.970 
visualization down through this design
that<00:06:14.090> visualization<00:06:14.660> can<00:06:15.230> very<00:06:15.530> easily<00:06:15.710> be

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
that visualization can very easily be

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.730 
that visualization can very easily be
exported<00:06:16.340> out<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:17.000> AVI<00:06:17.510> and<00:06:17.960> otherwise<00:06:18.380> share

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
exported out to AVI and otherwise share

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.340 
exported out to AVI and otherwise share
with<00:06:18.950> your<00:06:19.100> stakeholders
