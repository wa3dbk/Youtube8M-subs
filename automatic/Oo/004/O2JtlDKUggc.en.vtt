00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.560
 then we are in classic chianti we remain to do something that is not 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 never been made a kind of big brother of wine 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.809
 we will follow a vine from the beginning to the end of its annual vegetative cycle 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.039
 fender the most important phases 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.260
 we are in particular the fortress company of the macie that we thank those who sing it 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.599
 I love the agronomist Mr. Action Luzi 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.230
 now alfio 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.090
 first of all we have a wedge-shaped bust of thanksgiving 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.359
 officially irons 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.359
 all the time you would spend this year 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.920
 what the company is capable of about 350 meters and this period too 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.310
 located 350 meters is 22 January 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
 it's the right time for another year. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.610
 at this point we have it 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.580
 bring but why you bet 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.450
 simply because life is a plant that naturally grows hair 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.550
 it was a spicy ust brescia 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.730
 we condition moso a breeding form which is the spurred cordon 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.200
 it is therefore either to maintain this form of breeding and to guarantee its own 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.510
 high quality production we have to intervene manually 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.700
 and if it is not possible to house what would happen would give marcuzzi she produced to the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.570
 same but not the same what 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.780
 quality level 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 for you then we bring 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.230
 bad horse breeding 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.440
 at the end of summer we have a private spurred cordon 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.570
 loved because hoped 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.430
 because there are 1 2 3 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.920
 4 spurs then we go to see them 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.330
 Meanwhile, starting to get ready, I'm going to get the camera 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.299
 and I'll take you while you're doing all this thanks 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.100
 then fine 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.420
 then see 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.009
 Here we are, we are slowly approaching our friend 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.810
 here it is then a good heart on yahoo you can rightly here I have told you another 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.010
 one thing we are launching right now for the competition to find a name for ours 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.020
 life because we will not follow it all year and as we call it pipol 11 pics 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 give us a name and we will be happy 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.759
 here there are 4 spurs 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.289
 productivity video iesies ulrike spurred cordon 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:23.020
 yes and from these four vegetative points we must leave 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.950
 let's say a productive year trellis producing luparella 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.659
 Coming soon 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.320
 the criterion to use is to leave the king 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.379
 lower price than 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.709
 paper 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.529
 tune itself 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.079
 therefore to the plant marijuana mother plant therefore this product very much 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.659
 the first excerpt 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.280
 who do not leave the first of all and this would be a spur and this 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.429
 it would be the perfect testosterone 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.429
 the second I hope raimondo spur 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.779
 and in the choice of gems we must leave the first productive week 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.729
 there is that 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.039
 will guarantee, however, the photographer - going to see a little work 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.890
 productive and printing groans a little deeper than respect plants 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.890
 to the others to the gods who are notes 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.059
 frames and chords look at it 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.119
 here it is the perfect one 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.790
 while I go ahead high continue 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.729
 this heart is the one who dances and the other 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.379
 topmost production app 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.379
 perfect 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.290
 usually how many I hope released 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.499
 we leave from 3 to the four spurs 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.790
 for a total of one bar estimated at around one kilo 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.650
 then for over four seasons we have our plant already carried 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.890
 we give you an appointment the next time see you
