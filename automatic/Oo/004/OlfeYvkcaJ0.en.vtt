someone<00:04:33.840> like<00:04:33.990> me<00:04:34.140> today<00:04:34.410> probably<00:04:34.800> would

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
someone like me today probably would

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.530

that<00:04:36.690> dick<00:04:36.930> mentality<00:04:37.669> overall<00:04:38.669> but<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.000> don't

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
that dick mentality overall but I don't
