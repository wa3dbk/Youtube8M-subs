00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello good morning guys and girls 

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:06.630
 I hope you are very well today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.339
 we bring another comparison of those that I 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.160
 they like comparative surveys because 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:14.269
 they are simple and they are pretty written 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.970
 but I wanted to tell you before anything that 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.980
 I'm comparing this 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 simply with the fact of buying are 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.470
 in my opinion terminals of similar 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 characteristics and quite competitive 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.600
 each other have a similar price so 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 So much is also that term 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.010
 in which they can compete 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.269
 in the free term of Argentina the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.359
 optimal that would be by the 3500 like 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.920
 that ls 3 min and so well you know 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.140
 when we share it, it will be shared 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.649
 Motorola Moto Gp against the Samsung 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 galaxy s3 mini these phones the truth 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.530
 Stress is pretty good 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 mini tino time much more is not much 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.690
 more old man let's say the best but 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.210
 it's still a first-class device 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.610
 that is, it is a first-class mediaset is very 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.280
 Well, they understood me, let's start 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.799
 forgive the phone 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.119
 let's start as I told you prices 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.479
 they are pretty similar so it's going to 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.430
 be pretty much fought the comparative well 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.280
 that we're going to start with the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 operating system the samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.759
 mini will be to the left of the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.229
 screen and the motor to the motorcycle that goes to 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.600
 be on the right in case I forget about 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.090
 put the explanation up if they have 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.149
 that in mind the operating system 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.430
 we have Android 4.1 comes to them in the s 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.380
 3 min and that's when it comes out of the box 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.380
 but that has update I think that 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.390
 until the last 4.3 I think that until then 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.250
 they will update the kat kit but I think 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.190
 that there are some problems or I think that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.290
 have up to 4.3 but 4.2 I think if 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.470
 you want 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.330
 the motor or motorcycle gp has 4.3 living 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.510
 out of the box with an update 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.820
 guaranteed to 4.4 who knows if after 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.670
 it will update the most but web 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.250
 they have both the internal integrated antenna 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.360
 because I say this we do not have some 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.920
 dimensions 121 1.5 mm high x 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.980
 63 millimeters wide x 9.85 millimeters 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.740
 of thickness in the engine or the motorcycle that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.060
 we have 129 point 9 millimeters high 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.610
 65 point 9 mm wide x 11 6 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.310
 millimeters thick we have a 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.720
 small advantage for mini stress that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.010
 it's a little bit smaller 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.750
 I think the screens is a bit more 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.030
 tiny the mini and we'll see more 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.670
 ahead 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.100
 in the motogp I think we have a 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 dual version without a version I think it's 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.030
 the one of 16 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 but I also heard about that in 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.000
 the presentation so there is a version 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.010
 which has dual sim 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 I do not know if he has the motorola 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:01.230
 neither of them has 4g lte 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.080
 they have up to hsv 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.659
 I do not know if they have hsp to plus according to 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.290
 the page tells me not but I'm 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:14.689
 sure neither of them have 4 g 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.120
 we have a novice processor 184 20 in 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.969
 the samsung galaxy s3 mini against a 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.909
 qualcomm snapdragon 400 on the motogp the 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.920
 galaxy s3 mini processor still takes 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.200
 follows hertz and has a processor 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.810
 double core and the motor or the motorcycle that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.560
 it takes 1.2 giga hertz and has four 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.150
 nuclei 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.920
 here we have the small advantage that is 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.450
 bend overcoming by two the amount of 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.969
 processors so maybe we can 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.280
 have an advantage we have a memory of 16 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.519
 gigas in minimal stress and a memory 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.319
 of 8 or 16 in the motogp we can choose 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.060
 any two but we can not expand 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.459
 the by means of micro sd 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.169
 here's a plus point for the s 3 mini 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.180
 this is a subject that despite 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.439
 seem minor this influences the purchase 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.260
 of several users the subject of a 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.629
 memory or I do not know that they have left 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.150
 alternatives but there are people who 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.959
 better prefer me in god I would prefer a 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.600
 a slot would not not determine my purchase 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.290
 but I would prefer that you have 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.240
 in both have bluetooth 4.0 have the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.690
 same specifications in terms of 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.850
 connectivity have a screen of 4 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.370
 inches in the samsung galaxy s3 mini 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.340
 with a 45 screen on the engine or the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.500
 moto g, that's why the moto gp is bigger 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.080
 but it 's pretty well optimized with 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.710
 the edges and they did it quite 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.440
 compact that I like then we have a 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.680
 400 x 800 resolution in stress 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.390
 minimum against a resolution hd 720 x 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.000
 1080 on the motogp 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.720
 we have a super amoled screen in the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.790
 ds3 mini against an ips lcd on the engine 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.240
 here it depends on the consumer and which 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.190
 you like it more to know which one is 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.480
 Your liking the two are very good in 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.980
 we both have a 5 camera 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.920
 megapixels in this also I wanted 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.210
 go through this also what I chose 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.900
 has the same resolution 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.600
 both have led flash 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.340
 samsung galaxy s3 mini supposedly not 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.810
 has good hdr that I know I do not know according to 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.080
 the pages that do not but may have 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.000
 know forgive me is not anything and 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.949
 I'm going to ask them, I'm going 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.530
 to say later in the comments 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.419
 we have a second camera in both 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.750
 devices a front camera for 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:35.110
 video calls or a photo taken 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.960
 yourselves goal of 0.3 megapixels 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.729
 The Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini and 1.3 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.669
 megapixels in the engine or the motorcycle that 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.040
 we have an advantage in the engine now 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.100
 mounting 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.070
 we have video recording both to hd 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.290
 720 p at 30 frames per second we have 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.740
 autofocus and we can also record with the 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.740
 frontal camera 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.419
 in terms of battery the samsung galaxy 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.289
 s3 mini has a lithium-ion battery 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:07.009
 of 1500 very well perez now that is a 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.930
 little bit let's say in second opinion 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.639
 there are more smaller phones with the 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.550
 same battery and has a good 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.169
 feeling so while this is 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.090
 something they have to learn screen 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.639
 largest largest battery this 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.530
 this is something that if people understood 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.289
 of Motorola that put a battery of 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.229
 Lithium-ion of 2000 70,000 in Perez hours 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:32.430
 in the engine or motorcycle g as a conclusion 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.979
 I would like to tell you that as a winner, 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.750
 would find a direct winner languages 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.060
 I would declare it a draw because there are people 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.210
 that you can prefer a phone with 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.770
 expandable memory to one that can not 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.300
 there are people who would prefer a phone more 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.610
 new and that sure has a 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.009
 update to the newest version yo 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.509
 I think they only do well with this 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.720
 people who may not like touchwiz 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:57.000
 touchwiz the interface of samsung and if such 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.620
 Once we want to buy it this is going to 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.210
 depend on the buyer 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.250
 both are enough 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.800
 good devices for the price in the 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.199
 medium range to which they are priced 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.509
 quite competitive with each other have 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.150
 almost the same specifications so 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.620
 everything depends on you any 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.660
 question they have about the two 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.669
 I can go to the terminals 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.560
 do everything possible to respond to 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.770
 I will always be reading all 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.660
 the comments do not forget about 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.800
 follow us on twitter @ argentine lapse 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.780
 was that I was going to be in link in the 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.490
 description you already know that if you have 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.160
 liked the video is appreciated if we 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.990
 they can leave a little finger up like a 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.699
 comment and you can subscribe to 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.009
 channel for many more comparatives 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.210
 reviews and anything that come 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.160
 I also have a second channel on 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.449
 second the lingua is in the description 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.979
 I have several videos that I made 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.889
 previously after emigrating up 

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:49.710
 here so you know this has been the 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:51.919
 video for today greetings and even the 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.919
 next 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.740
 and 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.740
 i
