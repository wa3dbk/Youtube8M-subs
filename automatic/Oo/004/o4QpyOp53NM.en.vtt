I'll have it set at a decent point like
right<00:01:57.380> around<00:01:57.530> here

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
right around here

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.300 
right around here
this<00:01:59.510> thing<00:01:59.840> will<00:02:00.050> idle<00:02:00.590> itself<00:02:01.100> without

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
this thing will idle itself without

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.260 
this thing will idle itself without
having<00:02:01.520> us<00:02:02.140> idler<00:02:03.140> spring<00:02:03.460> when<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.610> dies<00:02:04.880> down

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270

or<00:02:07.450> tries<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.479> die<00:02:08.840> down<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:09.890> take<00:02:10.160> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
or tries to die down this will take it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.620 
or tries to die down this will take it
back<00:02:11.000> out

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
back out

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.290 
back out
letting<00:02:12.260> fuel<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.190> then<00:02:13.640> bringing<00:02:14.150> it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
letting fuel in and then bringing it

back<00:02:14.330> down<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:15.020> let<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.380> idle<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:17.150> try<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> die

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
back down to let it idle and try to die

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:31.410 
back down to let it idle and try to die
down<00:02:17.720> it'll<00:02:18.560> do<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:28.930> my<00:02:29.930> try<00:02:30.260> stand<00:02:30.620> down<00:02:30.860> here

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
down it'll do it my try stand down here

00:02:31.420 --> 00:04:00.410 
down it'll do it my try stand down here
if<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.600> doesn't<00:02:32.930> fire<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> first<00:02:33.860> try
