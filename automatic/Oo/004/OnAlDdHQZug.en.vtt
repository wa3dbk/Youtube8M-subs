00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.070 

I<00:00:05.130> had<00:00:06.130> three<00:00:06.370> pieces<00:00:06.580> of<00:00:06.880> cedar<00:00:07.149> that<00:00:07.450> my<00:00:07.599> wife

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
I had three pieces of cedar that my wife

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.770 
I had three pieces of cedar that my wife
had<00:00:08.320> dragged<00:00:08.650> back<00:00:08.919> from<00:00:09.250> a<00:00:09.400> neighbor<00:00:10.330> of<00:00:10.450> her

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
had dragged back from a neighbor of her

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.440 
had dragged back from a neighbor of her
parents<00:00:11.200> house<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:12.700> of<00:00:12.730> them<00:00:12.910> I<00:00:13.120> managed<00:00:13.360> to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
parents house one of them I managed to

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.140 
parents house one of them I managed to
get<00:00:13.599> to<00:00:13.780> quickly<00:00:14.019> and<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:14.980> made<00:00:15.190> two<00:00:15.519> bowls<00:00:15.820> out

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
get to quickly and I made two bowls out

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.599 
get to quickly and I made two bowls out
of<00:00:16.390> that<00:00:16.570> so<00:00:17.289> I<00:00:17.320> had<00:00:17.500> cut<00:00:17.740> it<00:00:17.859> in<00:00:18.010> half<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.580> cut

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
of that so I had cut it in half and cut

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.230 
of that so I had cut it in half and cut
it<00:00:19.390> into<00:00:19.539> a<00:00:19.630> round<00:00:19.960> on<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.260> bandsaw<00:00:21.130> and<00:00:21.460> then

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
it into a round on a bandsaw and then

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.240 
it into a round on a bandsaw and then
turned<00:00:22.570> turn<00:00:22.960> them<00:00:23.140> on<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.320> lathe<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:23.949> I<00:00:24.099> got

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
turned turn them on the lathe and I got

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.560 
turned turn them on the lathe and I got
to<00:00:24.400> that<00:00:24.519> quick<00:00:24.759> enough<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.269> hadn't

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
to that quick enough that it hadn't

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.499 
to that quick enough that it hadn't
started<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:26.170> check<00:00:26.500> but<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.009> crap<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:28.029> those

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
started to check but a crap so those

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.480 
started to check but a crap so those
bowls<00:00:28.810> are<00:00:29.050> drying<00:00:29.349> now<00:00:29.619> and<00:00:29.890> at<00:00:30.070> some<00:00:30.279> point

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
bowls are drying now and at some point

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.700 
bowls are drying now and at some point
I'll<00:00:30.820> finish<00:00:31.000> those<00:00:31.330> but<00:00:32.110> two<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.530> pieces

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
I'll finish those but two of the pieces

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.890 
I'll finish those but two of the pieces
I<00:00:33.010> had<00:00:33.160> left<00:00:33.460> out<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.270> never<00:00:34.330> got<00:00:34.660> to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
I had left out and I never got to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I had left out and I never got to
sealing<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.410> endgrain

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
sealing the endgrain

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.680 
sealing the endgrain
so<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:36.670> don't<00:00:36.880> necessarily<00:00:37.060> want<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.480> draw<00:00:37.660> a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
so I don't necessarily want to draw a

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.750 
so I don't necessarily want to draw a
circle<00:00:38.050> I<00:00:38.380> just<00:00:38.590> want<00:00:38.740> to<00:00:38.830> find<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.400> center

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
circle I just want to find the center

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.700 
circle I just want to find the center
but<00:00:40.720> since<00:00:40.930> you're<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.110> good<00:00:41.320> spot<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:44.350> find<00:00:44.620> a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
but since you're a good spot or find a

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.960 
but since you're a good spot or find a
spot<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.040> I<00:00:45.280> want<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.640> make<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.060> center<00:00:46.450> I

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
spot that I want to make the center I

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.580 
spot that I want to make the center I
found<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.060> center<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.810> drilled<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.110> hole<00:00:50.140> at

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
found the center and I drilled a hole at

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.740 
found the center and I drilled a hole at
the<00:00:50.620> center<00:00:51.040> and<00:00:51.220> they've<00:00:51.940> just<00:00:52.150> been<00:00:52.300> sitting

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
the center and they've just been sitting

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.210 
the center and they've just been sitting
and<00:00:52.870> now<00:00:52.990> they're<00:00:53.170> pretty<00:00:53.530> cracked<00:00:53.950> and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
and now they're pretty cracked and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.830 
and now they're pretty cracked and
they're<00:00:54.310> probably<00:00:54.520> too<00:00:54.820> far<00:00:55.030> gone<00:00:55.240> to<00:00:55.450> make<00:00:55.630> up

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
they're probably too far gone to make up

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.420 
they're probably too far gone to make up
a<00:00:55.930> whole<00:00:56.050> lot<00:00:56.290> of<00:00:56.470> so<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:56.950> thought<00:00:57.160> I'd<00:00:57.280> make<00:00:57.400> a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
a whole lot of so I thought I'd make a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.490 
a whole lot of so I thought I'd make a
stool<00:00:57.880> out<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.240> each<00:00:58.390> one<00:00:58.420> of<00:00:58.750> them<00:00:58.900> I<00:00:59.050> was

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
stool out of each one of them I was

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200 
stool out of each one of them I was
thinking<00:00:59.710> sort<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.070> an<00:01:00.160> outdoor<00:01:00.520> stool<00:01:00.910> since

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
thinking sort of an outdoor stool since

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.170 
thinking sort of an outdoor stool since
it's<00:01:01.420> cedar<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:02.110> it's<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.040> little<00:01:03.190> rough<00:01:03.490> and<00:01:04.000> I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
it's cedar and it's a little rough and I

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.169 
it's cedar and it's a little rough and I
found<00:01:04.420> my<00:01:04.539> circle<00:01:05.019> turning<00:01:05.229> jig<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.939> put

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:07.179 
found my circle turning jig and I put

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:09.929 
found my circle turning jig and I put
the<00:01:07.329> piece<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.840> cedar<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.530> bandsaw<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.310> I

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
the piece of cedar on the bandsaw and I

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.969 
the piece of cedar on the bandsaw and I
have<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.210> line<00:01:10.420> up<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.840> little<00:01:11.049> hole<00:01:11.320> with<00:01:11.950> a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
have to line up the little hole with a

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.440 
have to line up the little hole with a
screw<00:01:12.609> in<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.329> jig<00:01:14.609> so<00:01:15.609> the<00:01:15.670> idea<00:01:15.999> is<00:01:16.210> to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
screw in the jig so the idea is to

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.770 
screw in the jig so the idea is to
rotate<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.990> piece<00:01:17.590> around<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.490> screw<00:01:18.999> in<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
rotate the piece around the screw in the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.010 
rotate the piece around the screw in the
jig<00:01:20.079> that<00:01:20.490> works<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.820> then<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.329> hit<00:01:22.630> some<00:01:22.929> of

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
jig that works and then I hit some of

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.870 
jig that works and then I hit some of
the<00:01:23.109> bark<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:23.890> think<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.340> bark<00:01:24.640> really

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the bark and I think the bark really

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.630 
the bark and I think the bark really
dulls<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.539> blade<00:01:25.929> has<00:01:26.829> all<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.219> sudden<00:01:27.549> it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
dulls the blade has all of a sudden it

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.719 
dulls the blade has all of a sudden it
just<00:01:27.670> stopped<00:01:28.149> cutting<00:01:28.539> very<00:01:28.960> well<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.579> I<00:01:30.609> took

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
just stopped cutting very well so I took

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.580 
just stopped cutting very well so I took
it<00:01:30.909> off<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.119> I<00:01:31.450> tried<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.869> again<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.380> then<00:01:32.530> I

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
it off and I tried it again and then I

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.160 
it off and I tried it again and then I
got<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.859> blade<00:01:33.100> stuck<00:01:33.579> in<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> piece<00:01:34.329> I<00:01:34.600> had

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
got the blade stuck in the piece I had

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.859 
got the blade stuck in the piece I had
to<00:01:35.319> break<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.859> piece<00:01:36.310> off<00:01:36.579> around<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.600> blade

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
to break the piece off around the blade

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.739 
to break the piece off around the blade
and<00:01:38.319> I<00:01:38.799> managed<00:01:39.069> to<00:01:39.189> save<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.460> blade<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.179> the

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
and I managed to save the blade and the

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.559 
and I managed to save the blade and the
piece<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.229> put<00:01:42.069> a<00:01:42.100> different<00:01:42.520> blade<00:01:42.819> on<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.389> I

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
piece I put a different blade on and I

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.499 
piece I put a different blade on and I
cut<00:01:43.899> off<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.499> Bulge<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.549> had<00:01:45.700> been<00:01:45.880> there<00:01:46.090> so

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
cut off the Bulge that had been there so

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.809 
cut off the Bulge that had been there so
you<00:01:46.569> can<00:01:47.380> see<00:01:47.499> sort<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.829> flat<00:01:48.069> spot<00:01:48.399> there<00:01:48.670> on

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
you can see sort of a flat spot there on

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.679 
you can see sort of a flat spot there on
the<00:01:48.909> piece<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.359> I<00:01:50.289> put<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.590> face<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:51.549> put<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.569> on

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
the piece and I put the face I put it on

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.560 
the piece and I put the face I put it on
the<00:01:52.810> lathe

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.390 

and<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.900> kind<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.260> see<00:01:59.409> how<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.650> bulges<00:02:00.130> there

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
and you kind of see how it bulges there

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.050 
and you kind of see how it bulges there
and<00:02:01.300> then<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.720> started<00:02:02.110> turning<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.610> start<00:02:06.880> with

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
and then I started turning to start with

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.240 
and then I started turning to start with
what<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.300> did<00:02:07.510> was<00:02:07.659> just<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.960> get<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.410> cylinder

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
what I did was just to get the cylinder

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.520 
what I did was just to get the cylinder
round<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.209> was<00:02:13.330> mostly<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:13.690> turning<00:02:14.230> hair

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
round and I was mostly just turning hair

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.830 
round and I was mostly just turning hair
at<00:02:14.740> this<00:02:14.860> point<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.880> see<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.300> I'm<00:02:16.540> just

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
at this point you can see that I'm just

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:32.610 
at this point you can see that I'm just
hitting<00:02:17.440> where<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.070> Bulge<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.500> this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
hitting where the Bulge is but this

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.660 
hitting where the Bulge is but this
didn't<00:02:32.950> take<00:02:33.070> too<00:02:33.250> long

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
didn't take too long

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.170 
didn't take too long
I<00:02:33.700> got<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.570> round<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:36.760> once<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.030> had<00:02:37.150> it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
I got it round and then once I had it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.560 
I got it round and then once I had it
round<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.840> could<00:02:37.900> work<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.860> end<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:40.300> went

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
round I could work on the end this went

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.210 
round I could work on the end this went
pretty<00:02:40.750> slow<00:02:41.050> because<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.530> all<00:02:41.680> end<00:02:41.920> grain

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
pretty slow because it's all end grain

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.740 
pretty slow because it's all end grain
so<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.489> sort<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.700> hard<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.970> cut<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.540> had<00:02:43.660> to

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
so it's sort of hard to cut so I had to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.930 
so it's sort of hard to cut so I had to
keep<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.410> tool<00:02:44.739> really<00:02:45.130> really<00:02:45.340> sharp<00:02:45.580> I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
keep this the tool really really sharp I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940 
keep this the tool really really sharp I
turned<00:02:46.750> off<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.260> bit<00:02:47.470> where<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
turned off a little bit where the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.970 
turned off a little bit where the
tailstock<00:02:48.519> was<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.410> figured<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:50.560> side<00:02:50.830> would

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
tailstock was I figured this side would

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.790 
tailstock was I figured this side would
be<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.190> bottom<00:02:52.060> sort<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.260> got<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.650> all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
be the bottom sort of so I got it all

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.319 
be the bottom sort of so I got it all
cleaned<00:02:54.250> up<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.519> finished<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.300> scraped<00:02:56.200> it

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
cleaned up and finished I scraped it

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.360 
cleaned up and finished I scraped it
then<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.450> sanded<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.070> could<00:03:00.220> move

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
then I sanded it and then I could move

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.970 
then I sanded it and then I could move
the<00:03:00.579> faceplate<00:03:01.269> around<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.230> side<00:03:02.290> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the faceplate around to this side and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.890 
the faceplate around to this side and
flip<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.760> whole<00:03:03.910> piece<00:03:04.090> around<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.750> then

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
flip the whole piece around and then

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.569 
flip the whole piece around and then
that<00:03:04.930> side<00:03:05.350> would<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.860> sort<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.160> finished

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
that side would then be sort of finished

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.150 
that side would then be sort of finished
and<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:08.049> could<00:03:08.230> work<00:03:08.350> on<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> rest<00:03:08.829> of<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
and I could work on the rest of the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.840 
and I could work on the rest of the
piece<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.930> main<00:03:11.200> work<00:03:11.590> on<00:03:11.829> this<00:03:11.980> was<00:03:12.280> carving

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
piece the main work on this was carving

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.509 
piece the main work on this was carving
out<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.540> center<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.709> sort<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.100> wanted<00:03:15.459> to

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
out the center and I sort of wanted to

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.850 
out the center and I sort of wanted to
take<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.910> lot<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.329> weight<00:03:16.570> off<00:03:16.739> between<00:03:17.739> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
take a lot of the weight off between the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.370 
take a lot of the weight off between the
two<00:03:18.130> ends<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.790> hollowed<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.360> between<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
two ends so I hollowed out between the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.560 
two ends so I hollowed out between the
two<00:03:20.410> ends<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> seat<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.299> sort<00:03:22.480> of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
two ends of the seat so that it sort of

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.080 
two ends of the seat so that it sort of
looks<00:03:22.750> like<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.900> spool<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:24.400> was<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> lot<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.820> time

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
looks like a spool it was a lot of time

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.449 
looks like a spool it was a lot of time
spent<00:03:25.390> carving<00:03:25.930> away<00:03:26.079> all<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.709> material<00:03:27.280> and

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
spent carving away all this material and

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.940 
spent carving away all this material and
finding<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.299> shape<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.870> like<00:03:28.959> which<00:03:29.799> in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
finding the shape that I like which in

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.660 
finding the shape that I like which in
the<00:03:30.040> end<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.400> work<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.390> liked<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.720> lot

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.690 

and<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.690> went<00:03:38.140> over<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.440> with<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.590> scraper<00:03:38.950> it's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
and I went over it with a scraper it's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.500 
and I went over it with a scraper it's
smooth<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.840> was<00:03:40.959> done<00:03:41.170> with<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.380> turning<00:03:41.830> I

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.510 

did<00:03:46.510> some<00:03:46.750> sanding<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.380> thought<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.069> was<00:03:48.190> pretty

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
did some sanding I thought it was pretty

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.340 
did some sanding I thought it was pretty
rough<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.180> used<00:03:49.360> my<00:03:49.510> grinder<00:03:50.140> which

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
rough so I just used my grinder which

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.410 
rough so I just used my grinder which
actually<00:03:50.980> worked<00:03:51.190> really<00:03:51.370> well<00:03:51.490> super<00:03:52.150> fast

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
actually worked really well super fast

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.960 
actually worked really well super fast
and<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:53.050> put<00:03:53.260> some<00:03:53.290> wood<00:03:53.650> conditioner<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.610> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and I put some wood conditioner on the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.360 
and I put some wood conditioner on the
piece<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.510> had<00:03:55.990> some<00:03:56.230> outdoor<00:03:56.770> or<00:03:57.100> sort<00:03:57.310> of

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
piece I had some outdoor or sort of

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.930 
piece I had some outdoor or sort of
marine<00:03:57.700> grade<00:03:58.480> finish<00:03:59.410> but<00:04:00.340> after<00:04:00.790> looking

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
marine grade finish but after looking

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.580 
marine grade finish but after looking
for<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.390> for<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.600> while<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.780> couldn't<00:04:01.930> find<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.440> I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
for it for a while I couldn't find it I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.040 
for it for a while I couldn't find it I
decided<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.489> must<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.239> used<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.600> up<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.989> I<00:04:05.020> just

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
decided I must have used it up so I just

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.710
