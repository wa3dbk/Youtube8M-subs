00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
rhythms between that so let's see how

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.820 
rhythms between that so let's see how
that<00:00:14.040> goes<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:18.050> can't<00:00:19.050> see<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.320> crash<00:00:19.529> cymbals

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830

cymbals up here and maybe I'll move my

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
cymbals up here and maybe I'll move my
camera<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:33.840> better<00:00:34.050> how's<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Sam all right let's take a quick look at

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
Sam all right let's take a quick look at
playing<00:00:37.260> pair<00:00:37.590> tools<00:00:37.770> between<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.160> crash

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
playing pair tools between your crash

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.670 
playing pair tools between your crash
cymbals<00:00:38.879> snare<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.450> bass<00:00:40.020> drum<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.590> like

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
cymbals snare and bass drum just like

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.740 
cymbals snare and bass drum just like
before<00:00:40.829> when<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.160> were<00:00:41.190> doing<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> Tom's

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
before when we were doing the Tom's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.810 
before when we were doing the Tom's
let's<00:00:42.750> play<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.260> each<00:00:44.010> accent<00:00:44.700> at

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
let's play them so each accent at

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.240 
let's play them so each accent at
sixteenth<00:00:45.390> notes<00:00:45.570> each<00:00:45.750> accent<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sixteenth notes each accent is on the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.549 
sixteenth notes each accent is on the
cymbal<00:00:47.870> either<00:00:48.870> hand<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.410> wherever

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
cymbal either hand you can do wherever

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
cymbal either hand you can do wherever
you<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.820> bass<00:00:50.940> drum

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you want and then you get your bass drum

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
you want and then you get your bass drum
going<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.510> well<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.379> how

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
going as well with it so let's see how

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:09.920 
going as well with it so let's see how
that<00:00:52.530> sounds<00:01:08.420> once<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.630> done<00:01:09.720> flying

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that sounds once you get done flying

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
that sounds once you get done flying
those<00:01:10.140> crash<00:01:10.350> cymbals<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.010> three<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
those crash cymbals on one two three and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.039 
those crash cymbals on one two three and
four<00:01:11.490> start<00:01:12.210> breaking<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.780> little<00:01:12.869> bit

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
four start breaking it up a little bit

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
four start breaking it up a little bit
maybe<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.650> play<00:01:13.830> them<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.310> instead

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
maybe just play them on you know instead

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
maybe just play them on you know instead
of<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.240> playing<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:16.200> three<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of just playing on one two three and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
of just playing on one two three and
four<00:01:16.890> start<00:01:17.549> splitting<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.330> accent

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
four start splitting them up that accent

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
four start splitting them up that accent
on<00:01:18.900> different<00:01:19.229> rhythms<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.770> always<00:01:20.040> keep

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
on different rhythms but always keep

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.310 
on different rhythms but always keep
that<00:01:20.580> standard<00:01:21.150> paradiddles<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.960> keep<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that standard paradiddles going keep the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
that standard paradiddles going keep the
thing<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> time<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.119> go

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
thing going all the time so here we go

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:36.580 
thing going all the time so here we go
here's<00:01:24.360> another<00:01:24.479> example

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.800 

similar<00:01:37.590> pattern<00:01:37.980> but<00:01:38.580> basically<00:01:39.150> you're

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
similar pattern but basically you're

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
similar pattern but basically you're
going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> utilize<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.950> peridot<00:01:41.310> keeping<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
going to utilize the peridot keeping the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.430 
going to utilize the peridot keeping the
peridot<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.120> going<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.990> maybe<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.260> get<00:01:43.320> this

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
peridot is going but maybe you get this

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.200 
peridot is going but maybe you get this
little<00:01:43.650> groove<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.790> between<00:01:44.970> your

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
little groove going in between your

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.310 
little groove going in between your
snare<00:01:45.420> drums<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:45.960> working<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.290> way

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
snare drums so you're working your way

00:01:46.320 --> 00:02:09.850 
snare drums so you're working your way
in<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.740> circle<00:01:46.890> let's<00:01:47.220> try<00:01:47.340> that

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.020 

both<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.979> those<00:02:11.070> two<00:02:11.280> things<00:02:11.430> together<00:02:11.610> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
both of those two things together you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.250 
both of those two things together you
can<00:02:12.330> kind<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.690> pretty<00:02:12.900> cool<00:02:13.050> groove

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
can kind of get a pretty cool groove

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
can kind of get a pretty cool groove
with<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.650> let's<00:02:13.830> try<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.100> again<00:02:37.730> slowly

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
with it so let's try that again slowly

00:02:38.730 --> 00:03:16.440 
with it so let's try that again slowly
we'll<00:02:39.570> do<00:02:40.070> slow<00:02:41.070> motion<00:02:41.100> for<00:02:42.060> you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.790 

now<00:03:17.450> let's<00:03:17.600> take<00:03:17.690> a<00:03:17.750> quick<00:03:17.870> look<00:03:18.080> at<00:03:18.230> playing<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
now let's take a quick look at playing a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.650 
now let's take a quick look at playing a
cool<00:03:19.100> groove<00:03:19.370> doing<00:03:20.120> some<00:03:20.270> of<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.390> paradiddle

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
cool groove doing some of the paradiddle

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.180 
cool groove doing some of the paradiddle
things<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.080> worked<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.440> between<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.860> hi-hat

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
things we worked on between the hi-hat

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.750 
things we worked on between the hi-hat
and<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.520> snare<00:03:22.959> as<00:03:23.959> well<00:03:24.230> as<00:03:24.489> it's<00:03:25.489> going<00:03:25.670> to

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
and the snare as well as it's going to

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.220 
and the snare as well as it's going to
crash<00:03:25.940> cymbals<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:26.450> let's<00:03:26.959> see<00:03:27.050> where<00:03:27.170> that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
crash cymbals so let's see where that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:55.380 
crash cymbals so let's see where that
goes

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.450 

you
