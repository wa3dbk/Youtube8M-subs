 it takes to unlock it and good 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.770
 it's going to debut against this team that 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.130
 is a team of seriousness with falcao 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.990
 up and well then at the beginning so 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.150
 will cost to devised costa la for buffoon 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.490
 that we were crossed again in our 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.430
 road as we did with villa in 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.040
 the in the previous episode and well then 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.620
 here yes that will forgive us 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.690
 here the buffon in the next 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.420
 played right after this one 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.840
 in this match of hands we played the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.850
 title and start collecting and efe that 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.699
 we had unlocked set here the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.470
 center of gabi that has a glove of a 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.259
 glove or two I do not know how many are well 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.240
 the foot but good besides that diego 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.490
 coast that has an interesting helmet 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.020
 get gets 0 to 1 the truth is 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.149
 that since I got it all centers 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.549
 you go ahead before you finished godin 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.250
 but everything already falls to everything there is to 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.840
 coast and well then here I'm going to throw 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.369
 the penalty with you coast because to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.369
 unlock the version all that 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.470
 we need to score 10 goals with this 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.330
 person is to remember that the one of 83 does not 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.789
 I'm going to use on this athletic face in 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.679
 this series and we need 10 goals with the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.600
 of the version I speak the wi-fi version and 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.190
 the shift version and well, if you have 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 I have not seen the penalty 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.460
 left because the rival was going to take him 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.289
 he stole the ball and I get and with diego 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.030
 costa a golazo from afar and once 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.759
 that we beat buffon by 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.039
 first time everything was more fluid 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.100
 new diego diego costa with this piece 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.110
 of helmet there curly that has to do 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.810
 the 0-4 and this was still the first 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.000
 part we go to the second nothing more 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.550
 just start this great play of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.099
 coast with a roulette and on what line and 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.360
 gets the 0 to 5 his fifth goal in his 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.459
 particular and good account because 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.310
 we have done half the way 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.900
 to pass with this goal we already have 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.610
 the two bosses unlocked because 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.680
 remember to join a hat trick 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.270
 unblock a and efe as we carry two 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.310
 hat tricks with you there are six 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.680
 goals because we already had the boss and the siff 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.170
 unlocked and fix there the little 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.769
 will do for 0 to 7 and well then 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.900
 with this with this goal we already had a lot 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.760
 70% of the 70% off the road to 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.470
 to be able to pass even delhi efe already 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.690
 we have unlocked but not until 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.700
 get the goal I will not go to 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.709
 iron to later not have to be 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 going back to back and all that 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.560
 so then let's go to wait for 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.440
 have the goal before before 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.330
 happen as I say to the versions to the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.730
 black cards and color charts 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.430
 in this case, because it would cost would be still and 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.590
 and well we won the trophy means 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.490
 that now we're going to add four bosses to 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.860
 our collection 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.780
 to our team and well with raÃºl 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.360
 as we have unlocked the two 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.010
 and we are going to do one thing and that is 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.980
 I'm going to play three games with the version 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.770
 and f3 and since then I'm going to 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.690
 put the shift version up maybe the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.310
 until it ends more or less that you already have 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.440
 all the bosses unlocked because the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.330
 version and efe of raÃºl garcÃ­a la we can 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.920
 use of mc or that I think it's going to 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.080
 serve much more than if we use it from 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.030
 half right but to give him a game 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.740
 the two of us are going to do it like this 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.630
 three games with the version and then efe 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.130
 happened to the cif and we're going to stay in 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.800
 this version until we get it 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.650
 unlock everything almost everything and then 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.820
 we will return to the and efe to use it in a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.800
 site where I think you can be 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.750
 get more out of there you have seen the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.460
 colorino that I had to 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.560
 have another rival 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.450
 suppose to be a sheik or something because 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.460
 the name seems to be out there 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.040
 Sheikh Arab and good, well, I say Costa 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.900
 first thing you have there with the left 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.880
 between the ball asking permission but 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.920
 well in the end, the important thing is that 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.170
 go in there is going to have another one gave costa the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.580
 paranoia that between that there is not you are very 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.670
 good and that gave cost of face to goal 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.950
 defining is not the best of the game either 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.080
 far from it because the truth that 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.320
 it cost quite 10 minutes 33 co that 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.630
 all in favor in the deco version and efe 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.820
 that already of the end then sends it skimming 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.610
 the stick minute 62 is the ball of 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.050
 Juanfran now or give it to the coast 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.970
 now it is going to be very good he 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.830
 guise and eat it gets between two and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.720
 puts her in the squad and crossed there yes 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.300
 that can not do anything or noyer or 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.520
 the most not yesterday and well then in the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.200
 minute 75 there goes the pass in depth 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.570
 the against miranda that makes a shit 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.280
 but he talked about fixing there he gets and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.900
 get it because I think with that 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.430
 animation that made of that courtois I 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.220
 I think it was because she was despondent 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.170
 and well he got with this with this 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.870
 miraculous crossing more than anything that does not 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.180
 we received goals you know that for 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.919
 so much to unlock courtois 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.650
 to unlock any defense 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.300
 we all need unbeaten goals 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.669
 the more better I once I already 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.330
 I can get ahead because the 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.680
 truth not the first thing I try is that 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.039
 do not receive us goals 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.810
 more than the first to not suffer between 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:19.380
 quotes that with a possible winning 20 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.610
 that he gets 21 and already be all the time 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.620
 pending that we are tied and also 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.600
 so to go unlocking the tops and 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.100
 Well the last game today will 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.430
 be against this team that we see there from 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.340
 brazil bears and with the two golds that are 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.660
 neymar and diego alves and well it is a 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.250
 rare match because the opponent played 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.930
 quite rare the defense very advanced 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.300
 but 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.770
 even being advanced in the council not 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.080
 I could get my back here 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.460
 I managed to do at the beginning but seen 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.740
 don diego costa that the lover too 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.650
 crossed and then that authentic golazo 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.090
 of volley to the half turn of coast in 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.400
 the second time a little he can 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.229
 get to see the hole there on the back 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.669
 of the defense here we return it to 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.810
 find and now I say coast fails 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.130
 because I think he has with the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.830
 left is only shot with the right 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.270
 it would be goal and good minutes 65 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.830
 buckle recovery very well in the 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.110
 pressure to stop here the mouth 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.610
 guilavogui above to catch and the 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.400
 coil is a show is me 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.590
 enchanting in this in this series and koke 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.169
 then there's a half volley 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.479
 get the 0-2 and well then there after a 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.220
 out of play I say coast recovers good 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.710
 I say it's recovered, nobody gives it to them 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.930
 to diego costa so that it recovers or that 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.460
 raÃºl garcÃ­a gives it and look where the 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.380
 puts raÃºl garcÃ­a that is always there 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.639
 always appears always yields and now 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.400
 they put the ball in the squad 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.620
 remember also that konko that we have to 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.500
 the version and efe for and we need then 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.020
 that will pass the hands-on version for more 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.060
 get to get then the 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.560
 toxins version we need three goals and 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.030
 five assists 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.669
 and another one for david villa and well then 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.550
 until this episode is going to arrive
