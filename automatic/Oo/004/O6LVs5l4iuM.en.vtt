00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.870
 good to the cars not yet lived the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.759
 news the truth that has caught us 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.099
 all of improvisto not improvisto one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.129
 little because it really is like saying that 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.269
 next year we will have figure 15 not 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.640
 it's a little bit I know how to say something about ya 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.859
 has said no but good what is important is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 what is behind all this and is that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.410
 well it seems that the actor who is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.390
 behind sergeant frank boots 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.490
 of the call of duty games saga 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.110
 black ops' well it seems that he said 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 in a video he has a youtube channel 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.450
 he is a showman we could say he likes 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.309
 much talk we could say also and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.960
 good it seems that in the video in the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.600
 minute two feet more or less it seems 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 be that says this month or later 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.220
 for focusing information on the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.809
 next black ops and then I kind of like that 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.460
 is choked and from the next call of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.629
 duty me the truth 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.000
 I do not know if we will see a black ops 3 I do not know 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.640
 sure we will see a kart and every year 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.119
 this mega kaka or mega mom or that is 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.040
 clear every year one made by treyarch and 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.200
 then the next year made by 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.790
 infinity ward or that always like that and it seems 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.040
 be that it will always be like this the data 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.460
 financials do not go down they go up 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.280
 and they do not go up they keep lowering a 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.220
 little figures that really do not 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.930
 They take a long time either and they are often 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.670
 go well the other franchise that is going 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.210
 perfectly 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.330
 activision is that they will continue 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.100
 exploiting in this way every year I the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.130
 true in case there is a black ops 3 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.649
 surely an exception is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.560
 I do not mean enough because 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.690
 the concept of continuing to explode no longer 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.690
 only a saga of games like oscar 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.960
 urruty but above a sub name in its 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.530
 game as it could be because black box and 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.979
 I appear a bit already pretty ridiculous 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.829
 I do not think they should invent 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.670
 other names but to make sagas of said 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.950
 games no no 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.409
 be sub sagas of a saga I do not think 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.200
 I do not know how to explain it to make a saga of 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.810
 a frustrated one is like me that I know 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.729
 something that seems a bit strange to me and 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.200
 rare just having two companies that 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.230
 devote totally to the opposite is 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.870
 how to imagine next year 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.970
 follow those who come to black ops 3 and 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.760
 then to the next call of duty costs 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.769
 I do not know it's a bit weird weird and confused 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.269
 a little to the customers that really 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.610
 clients because it seems that the modes 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.800
 campaigns because you do not usually like it 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.410
 I usually play people because I know 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.680
 we usually play it , it destroys us 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.720
 little all the schemes is not a little 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.120
 I miss you as I say extreme white 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 Exceptionality completely me by me 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.220
 that they return again to the second war 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.810
 world or something old because to me 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.690
 I already believe that it is already time to 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.390
 return to the ancients as it was call of 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.000
 duty 5 in each car equal which 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.880
 it was one of the great titles for me 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.190
 that hit a change after modern 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.049
 warfare not a modern warfare call of 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.819
 duty 4 I already have already got a jump no longer 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.610
 I have a change a change regarding the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.019
 previous and then every last the uar 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.450
 I have also a change from 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.540
 modern warfare modern warfare 1 that was 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.180
 for me 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.579
 a perfect know- how no sooner then 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.090
 come the sagas of the sagas and that's it 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.519
 It was fine little gem not the mess and the mess 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.120
 it's true that I liked it 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.859
 a lot of all the call of duty is the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.140
 preferred has been 4 and 5 for me 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.390
 that's the best then from 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.400
 there the saga started 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.709
 do not get hooked on the talk enough 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.430
 less than modern warfare2 modern warfare 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.170
 3 and black ops started to hook 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.910
 much less not talking with this yes that is 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.569
 plays quite true that the first 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.450
 months and guys 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.879
 little or almost nothing I know what it is that 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.499
 game I think the game when I go to 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.909
 Upload some video of the rubbish garbage or 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.950
 when I want to record some video 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.299
 talking about it when I want to record a 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.760
 video to have fun to you 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.260
 directly with josÃ© miguel and that as 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.209
 I say with our garbage that then 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.219
 He left to enjoy us for 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.989
 that you see how I shit on the whore not with 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.480
 a fire and how I stress but for me 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.650
 last face has been that least matured 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.239
 not in the hands has been that less 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.489
 matured engaging I think that has 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.829
 lasted two three four days playing 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.829
 when I quite the truth 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.710
 next year that's clear is that 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.100
 nobody sees this uncle has not discovered 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.199
 neither America nor has it discovered a country 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.509
 far away surely go to work and 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.550
 surely it is black ops 3 but 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.180
 What I want to get is that we will see 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.979
 see what information it gives because this saga 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.710
 It can be fun to do it well or 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.020
 you can do it wrong because how do you start 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.830
 or follow the path that is pulling 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.380
 call of duty to favor the newbies 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.590
 they put you sights for newbies to put 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.479
 weapons for novices to put grenades 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.520
 for novices not that tell you when 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.410
 they are going to explode and everything to put their 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.289
 march around the corners for novices and 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.740
 over do you become challenges for 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.050
 to fuck others is the cock that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.710
 is already the mega supports as if they go for that 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.710
 I believe that 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.260
 I'm not going to stop playing call of 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.310
 duty or a little you have little left 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.900
 So I keep going up because I like it 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.240
 Then see my anger when I try 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.370
 shit weapons to that when he tried 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.960
 make me a reactor of some shit weapon 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.180
 that is, he is not the only one who perhaps 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.220
 amuses me and you not in general 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.990
 so well nothing more kids this has 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.410
 been everything and we won in the next video 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.410
 until next time
