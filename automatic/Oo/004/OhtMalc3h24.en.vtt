00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 to forgiveness for noise but what happens 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
 today again I'm not at my table 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.679
 favorite indeed I'm on the floor 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 good a disaster a disaster but then 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.889
 everything will return to normal 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 quiet here nothing happens you see the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 cube fish is very good this is 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 extremely decadent it is worth not 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.090
 I repeated again that I did not find out 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.340
 but what do you have here that you have here today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960
 to show why this is these 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 It looks like a cube or this seems like a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 cube seriously if it's a cube like that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 Clear 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.399
 it's alright it's not good anymore cubes 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.870
 complexes as it is very strange if not a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.390
 very simple and entertaining cube to see 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.270
 that's as simple as that, it's clear 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 but it is extremely elegant and very 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 good quality and you deserve a video worth 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.469
 the mysterious snowflake does not snow 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.480
 good mystery that we have here that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.310
 we have here with this strange form 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.490
 Well, we have 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.370
 two levels is good here come the two 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.200
 levels and then we have six petals in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 each level is worth and a few stickers 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.430
 nice this here does not turn bad these 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.410
 these stickers are good here 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 these stickers obviously do not spin either 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.830
 what they spin are the pieces are not and we have 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.230
 two types of turns a combination 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.900
 quite exotic first of all in 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 first place let's see we have turns 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.800
 of 180 degrees here you see turns 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.830
 complete 180 degrees around here by 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.440
 here around here and this turn goes without 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 super easy and simple problems you do not go 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.100
 to never have any problem with this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.979
 turn and then we have a turn that divides 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.860
 halfway to the bucket, that is, we have 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.840
 turns of 60 degrees you see now it has already 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.070
 out of phase the structure we have kilos of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.260
 60 degrees 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.930
 then already while commenting the turn what 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.250
 I'm undoing this turn this turns and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.430
 sometimes can block because 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.170
 Of course, if you do not leave this well , 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 you leave so half-twisted clarified when 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 you are going to make this turn because you can not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.840
 because the parts do not go well, not if you're 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.119
 a slightly awkward person like you are not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.270
 able to tell the government because there 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270
 what 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.969
 and apply the force correctly not to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.039
 seeing this is not bad anymore but when 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.450
 you are not used to a quota at 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.010
 principle you do not know how to apply the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.310
 force then to make this turn 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.110
 you do like that or you go around here and do not 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.250
 you can not always take the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.140
 point to the cubes but hey this is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.269
 question of practice does not have 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.519
 no problem no good you see that already 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.260
 is completely undone we go 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.420
 talking up close because it's a cube of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.730
 very good quality you see the stickers 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.980
 they are very well they have a very 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.049
 whimsical are used and a little chubby 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.329
 do not get up easily you see this 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.440
 How interesting are you to puzzle 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.959
 they could have done it in another way 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.569
 but I think that with this way of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.220
 Snow candy this one is very good not 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.940
 because because it is much more elegant 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.099
 in fact in fact although it is extremely 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.620
 improbable sometimes sometimes when it snows 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.360
 falls in these cubes of heaven indeed 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.190
 this is how to get this that you 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.129
 you thought and well, stop with rolls 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.829
 stupid this cube this quota is of the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.569
 brand very pass it you know nothing the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.700
 famous brand watch and cake 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.290
 to see is a company that is not that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.860
 have lots of cubes in the market 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.560
 but those that 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.220
 and the ones you have are excellent because 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
 example he hollow truncated icosahedron the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.350
 boy 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.730
 ming that I do not have here right now 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.650
 because I'm not at home and of course not 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.120
 you are going to wear the ico sandro hollow 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.760
 truncated everywhere nothing because in 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.670
 the pocket does not enter that is clear 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.040
 it's hollow it's worth and it has as well 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.590
 infinite screws is a masterpiece 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.980
 It is a masterpiece masterpiece so 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.050
 Clear 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.959
 every time it's amazing it 's amazing 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.849
 In fact it is very complicated to adjust the 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.200
 tensions in that cube for example a 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.049
 cube that also has many screws 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.970
 is the botmaster paint ultimate and the other 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.799
 day I was ready and said I'm going to adjust 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.379
 the tensions here in this hollow cube 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.970
 loosen the screws and the psm disintegrated 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.580
 completely nothing a disaster but 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.310
 good another very interesting cube of the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.220
 brand very pastel is the geranium not 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.860
 man you already know a cube of a quality 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.390
 extraordinarily beautiful but also 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.430
 super complicated in fact I have not been 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.840
 able to solve it yet still but 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.660
 well someday I'll get it by 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.859
 Of course it is super complex 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.450
 but very beautiful and they took several 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.410
 simpler versions not because of course 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.729
 of good in saying good is that this is 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.519
 impossible I do not think anyone is capable of 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.690
 solve it not so are things like that are 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.190
 things and I hope he keeps pulling 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.240
 cubes even from time to time but 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.520
 good if they are so nice and interesting 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.380
 like this you can not see we're going to see it 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.449
 last time no closer man closer 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.570
 please I want to see all the details 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.919
 You see how it reflects the stickers have not been 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.470
 lifted nothing has some forms 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.610
 beautiful rounded and this central me 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.560
 love good ah and to solve it 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.300
 it's not complicated either because for example 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.490
 doing a level is very easy because I 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.560
 that I know you have you say I want to put here 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.289
 Rose, you're not looking for the rose that is 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.120
 on the other level and you put here will not 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.919
 then completing a level is very easy 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.180
 and then the other good level can you 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.580
 cost a little more when you have left 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.169
 two petals maybe but nothing with three or 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.400
 four movements is solved and is a 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.430
 as perfect to start precisely 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.719
 that's why it's simple and it's also 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.129
 very nice, not always good 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.469
 have interesting things in the 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.110
 collection I'm going to dismiss here already 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:12.120
 there was forgiveness of these please please 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.849
 this is very far today we say goodbye to 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.500
 distance because it is kilometers from 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.060
 distance although it seems it is the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.560
 perspective cheats but you see is 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.349
 impossible to catch them is very far away 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.330
 I hope you liked the 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.409
 cube the video as always and what happens 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.669
 What happens in the house? See you in 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.669
 another video in greeting to all
