weaker team just mentally but they

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.679

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
Africa definitely

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.690 
Africa definitely
to<00:02:15.099> beat<00:02:15.610> them<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.010> good<00:02:18.160> free-kick<00:02:18.430> by

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.309 
all of this but uh I think of us just
plays<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:21.069> they<00:02:21.190> did<00:02:21.430> verse<00:02:21.670> Egypt<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.420> like

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
plays like they did verse Egypt and like

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.750 
plays like they did verse Egypt and like
a<00:02:23.349> diverse<00:02:23.680> range<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:24.069> hard<00:02:24.310> work<00:02:24.519> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
a diverse range of hard work and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.610 
a diverse range of hard work and
teamwork<00:02:25.030> together<00:02:25.540> they'll<00:02:26.019> be<00:02:26.050> fine<00:02:26.170> um

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
excited i think the first game against

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.150 
excited i think the first game against
Brazil<00:02:46.060> was<00:02:46.420> sort<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.780> wake-up<00:02:47.140> call<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
Brazil was sort of a wake-up call to the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.890 
Brazil was sort of a wake-up call to the
whole<00:02:48.340> tournament<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.299> addition<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
whole tournament as in addition to the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.949 
whole tournament as in addition to the
game<00:02:50.590> vs<00:02:50.860> italy<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.610> know<00:02:52.239> Brazil<00:02:52.780> knows

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
game vs italy so I know Brazil knows

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.530 
game vs italy so I know Brazil knows
that<00:02:53.230> US<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.060> definitely<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> different<00:02:55.390> team

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
that US is definitely a different team

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.940 
that US is definitely a different team
since<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.989> game<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.470> think<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.769> should<00:02:56.920> be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
since that game so I think it should be

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
since that game so I think it should be
a<00:02:57.040> very<00:02:57.099> exciting<00:02:57.489> match<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.120> by<00:02:58.390> no<00:02:58.450> means

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
a very exciting match and by no means

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.520 
a very exciting match and by no means
USA<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.500> know<00:02:59.739> out<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.090> at<00:03:01.299> all<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:02.319> game

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
USA you know out of that at all the game

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.830 
USA you know out of that at all the game
against<00:03:02.799> Brazil<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.160> Sunday<00:03:03.579> I<00:03:03.940> don't<00:03:04.630> really

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
against Brazil on Sunday I don't really

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.360 
against Brazil on Sunday I don't really
know<00:03:05.049> what<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.290> expect<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.739> town<00:03:06.040> right<00:03:06.220> now

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
know what to expect that town right now

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.009 
know what to expect that town right now
because<00:03:06.670> we<00:03:07.150> haven't<00:03:07.569> had<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> best<00:03:07.930> luck

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
because we haven't had the best luck

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.650 
because we haven't had the best luck
against<00:03:08.410> brazil<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.010> past<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.510> way

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
against brazil in the past but the way

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.240
