00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
ponytail so it obviously doesn't come

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
around several times you're gonna pull

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
the last time so it makes a loop then

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.649 
the last time so it makes a loop then
with<00:00:59.860> bobby<00:01:00.100> pins<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.969> are<00:01:01.089> basically<00:01:01.449> gonna

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
be pulling this loop apart so you're

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.820 
be pulling this loop apart so you're
going<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.420> be<00:01:04.509> pinching<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.080> pulling<00:01:05.140> kind<00:01:05.770> of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
going to be pinching and pulling kind of

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.219 
going to be pinching and pulling kind of
in<00:01:05.920> opposite<00:01:06.340> directions<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.720> break<00:01:07.960> this

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
in opposite directions to break this

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.789 
in opposite directions to break this
loop<00:01:08.770> up<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.369> I<00:01:10.360> find<00:01:10.659> sometimes<00:01:11.560> with

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
loop up and I find sometimes with

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.920 
loop up and I find sometimes with
shorter<00:01:12.729> hair<00:01:12.759> these<00:01:13.060> work<00:01:13.299> actually<00:01:13.570> better

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
shorter hair these work actually better

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.719 
shorter hair these work actually better
that's<00:01:14.229> why<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.470> wanted<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.830> try<00:01:15.039> this<00:01:15.130> fun<00:01:15.520> and

funky<00:01:16.539> style<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:17.020> her<00:01:17.049> because<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.710> her

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
funky style on her because of her

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.190 
funky style on her because of her
shorter<00:01:18.310> hair<00:01:18.610> but<00:01:19.539> you're<00:01:19.690> gonna<00:01:19.780> pull<00:01:20.080> this

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
shorter hair but you're gonna pull this

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.350

apart and pin it as needed

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.290 
apart and pin it as needed
also<00:01:23.020> having<00:01:23.500> wet<00:01:23.800> hair<00:01:24.069> can<00:01:24.580> sometimes<00:01:25.090> help

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
also having wet hair can sometimes help

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.160 
also having wet hair can sometimes help
with<00:01:25.539> these<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.940> seems<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.420> get<00:01:28.509> Messier<00:01:28.960> that

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
with these it seems to get Messier that

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.710 
with these it seems to get Messier that
way<00:01:29.350> which<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:29.679> great<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.909> also<00:01:31.149> cuts<00:01:31.539> down<00:01:31.659> on

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
way which is great and also cuts down on

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.020 
way which is great and also cuts down on
the<00:01:31.840> flyaways<00:01:32.319> her<00:01:33.039> hair<00:01:33.220> was<00:01:33.429> a<00:01:33.460> bit<00:01:33.700> drier

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
divided it into smaller ones I'm gonna

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.470 
divided it into smaller ones I'm gonna
make<00:02:26.379> this<00:02:26.530> into<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.920> ponytail<00:02:27.280> with<00:02:28.209> another

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
make this into a ponytail with another

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.619 
make this into a ponytail with another
elastic<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.319> I'm<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.830> adding<00:02:30.190> those<00:02:30.629> tails

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
elastic and I'm just adding those tails

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.180 
elastic and I'm just adding those tails
from<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.080> butt<00:02:32.230> above<00:02:32.530> into<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.069> as<00:02:33.220> well<00:02:35.190> as

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
from the butt above into it as well as

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.640 
from the butt above into it as well as
you<00:02:36.459> did<00:02:36.580> before<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:38.019> last<00:02:38.200> time<00:02:38.530> you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you did before just the last time you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.890 
you did before just the last time you
wrap<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.830> elastic<00:02:39.430> around<00:02:39.580> pull<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.629> hair

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
wrap that elastic around pull that hair

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170 
wrap that elastic around pull that hair
through<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.410> makes<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.709> nice<00:02:41.830> big<00:02:42.129> loop<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
through so it makes a nice big loop and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.479 
through so it makes a nice big loop and
cinch<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.629> down<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.110> need<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.290> now<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.250> can

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
cinch it down if you need to now you can

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.520 
cinch it down if you need to now you can
pull<00:02:45.700> those<00:02:45.790> hairs<00:02:46.090> from<00:02:46.300> below<00:02:46.599> up<00:02:46.840> around<00:02:47.110> so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
pull those hairs from below up around so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.110 
pull those hairs from below up around so
they<00:02:47.680> kind<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.950> spray<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.700> add<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
they kind of spray out and add to the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.110 
they kind of spray out and add to the
messiness<00:02:49.769> for<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:50.920> style<00:02:51.129> though<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.489> opted

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
messiness for this style though I opted

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.620 
messiness for this style though I opted
to<00:02:52.480> pull<00:02:52.959> those<00:02:53.110> back<00:02:53.140> down

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
to pull those back down

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.910 
to pull those back down
sort<00:02:54.990> of<00:02:55.080> wrap<00:02:55.290> them<00:02:55.470> around<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.770> finger<00:02:57.920> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
sort of wrap them around my finger and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.760 
sort of wrap them around my finger and
then<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.580> pinned<00:02:59.940> them<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.300> underneath

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
then I pinned them up underneath

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.990 
then I pinned them up underneath
everything<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.280> they<00:03:02.400> kind<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> hit<00:03:04.910> missed<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
everything so they kind of hit missed a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.400 
everything so they kind of hit missed a
little<00:03:06.210> bit<00:03:06.360> there<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:06.630> we'll<00:03:07.080> get<00:03:07.230> that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
little bit there but we'll get that

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.680 
little bit there but we'll get that
eventually<00:03:07.680> tack<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.760> with<00:03:09.300> these<00:03:09.420> bobby

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
eventually tack it in with these bobby

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.200 
eventually tack it in with these bobby
