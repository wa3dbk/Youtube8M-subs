got the 1.8 5 seconds short reload time
and<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.680> gonna<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.979> great<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.369> close

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
long range it's not as big a deal if you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
easy to manage and it's because it

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.560 
easy to manage and it's because it
shoots<00:02:50.280> such<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> small<00:02:50.910> caliber<00:02:51.150> around

it's not gonna matter too much for
long-range<00:02:58.620> targets<00:02:59.160> because<00:02:59.550> you're<00:02:59.790> aiming

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
long-range targets because you're aiming

down sight accuracy isn't particularly

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.370 
down sight accuracy isn't particularly
great<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.519> 0.4<00:03:03.000> however<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:04.019> do<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.350> a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
great with 0.4 however you do have a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.710 
great with 0.4 however you do have a
pretty<00:03:04.650> tight<00:03:05.040> hipfire<00:03:05.330> grouping<00:03:06.330> which<00:03:06.510> is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
pretty tight hipfire grouping which is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.920 
pretty tight hipfire grouping which is
standard<00:03:07.530> for<00:03:07.560> PDW<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.700> lot<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.269> pdws

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
standard for PDW so a lot of the pdws

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.930 
standard for PDW so a lot of the pdws
are<00:03:10.110> intended<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.560> good<00:03:10.890> hipfire<00:03:11.400> accuracy

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
are intended for good hipfire accuracy

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.360 
are intended for good hipfire accuracy
and<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:12.989> make<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.590> even<00:03:13.830> better<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.250> you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
and you can make that even better if you

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.280 
and you can make that even better if you
put<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.610> laser<00:03:14.850> sight<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.209> there<00:03:15.510> now<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.989> have<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
put a laser sight on there now I have a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
put a laser sight on there now I have a
laser<00:03:16.620> sight<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.489> suppressor<00:03:18.000> which<00:03:18.239> kind

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
laser sight and a suppressor which kind

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.180 
laser sight and a suppressor which kind
of<00:03:18.600> counteract<00:03:19.019> each<00:03:19.410> other<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:19.860> still

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
of counteract each other so I still

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.310 
of counteract each other so I still
maintain<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.549> pretty<00:03:20.790> decent<00:03:21.360> hipfire<00:03:21.750> but<00:03:22.290> I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
maintain a pretty decent hipfire but I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.020 
maintain a pretty decent hipfire but I
stay<00:03:22.920> off<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> mini-map<00:03:23.519> with<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
stay off the mini-map with that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.270 
stay off the mini-map with that
suppressor<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.049> also<00:03:25.350> become<00:03:25.829> slightly

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
suppressor but I also become slightly

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400 
suppressor but I also become slightly
more<00:03:26.549> visible<00:03:27.239> with<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.450> laser<00:03:27.780> sight<00:03:27.959> so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
more visible with the laser sight so

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.840 
more visible with the laser sight so
there's<00:03:28.620> sort<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.860> pros<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.400> cons<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.820> using

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
there's sort of pros and cons to using

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.319 
there's sort of pros and cons to using
the<00:03:30.209> laser<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.049> suppressor<00:03:31.680> combo<00:03:32.070> together

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
the laser and suppressor combo together

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.819 
the laser and suppressor combo together
personally<00:03:33.329> I'm<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:34.049> big<00:03:34.200> fan<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.500> using

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
personally I'm a really big fan of using

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.500 
personally I'm a really big fan of using
this<00:03:35.100> combination<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.910> pretty<00:03:36.150> much<00:03:36.329> all

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
this combination with pretty much all

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.039 
this combination with pretty much all
pdws<00:03:37.320> mostly<00:03:37.890> because<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:39.000> bullet<00:03:39.480> velocity

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
pdws mostly because the bullet velocity

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.380 
pdws mostly because the bullet velocity
on<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.350> average<00:03:40.620> PDW<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.310> very<00:03:41.790> low<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.329> the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
on your average PDW is very low and the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.449 
on your average PDW is very low and the
suppressor<00:03:42.989> drops<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.410> bullet<00:03:43.739> velocity<00:03:43.829> to

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
suppressor drops that bullet velocity to

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.150 
suppressor drops that bullet velocity to
around<00:03:45.239> 300<00:03:45.870> meters<00:03:46.200> per<00:03:46.410> second<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.070> you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
around 300 meters per second so if you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.949 
around 300 meters per second so if you
already<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.549> PDW<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.420> shooting<00:03:48.750> at<00:03:48.900> a

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
already have a PDW that's shooting at a

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.199 
already have a PDW that's shooting at a
very<00:03:49.230> very<00:03:49.440> low<00:03:49.590> bullet<00:03:50.010> velocity<00:03:50.220> you're<00:03:51.030> not

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
very very low bullet velocity you're not

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.750 
very very low bullet velocity you're not
getting<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.600> huge<00:03:52.250> penalty<00:03:53.250> from<00:03:53.519> that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
getting a huge penalty from that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.520 
getting a huge penalty from that
suppressor<00:03:54.329> so<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.600> works<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.019> well

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
suppressor so it works out really well

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.099 
suppressor so it works out really well
with<00:03:55.680> pdws<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.579> as<00:03:56.850> we<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.180> see<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.480> ufp<00:03:57.930> 9

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
with pdws and as we can see the ufp 9

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.800 
with pdws and as we can see the ufp 9
has<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.430> 370<00:03:59.430> meters<00:03:59.609> per<00:03:59.970> second<00:04:00.390> bullet

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
has a 370 meters per second bullet

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.870 
has a 370 meters per second bullet
velocity<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.560> you're<00:04:01.709> really<00:04:01.950> not<00:04:02.100> losing<00:04:02.609> a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
velocity so you're really not losing a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.090 
velocity so you're really not losing a
lot<00:04:03.090> off<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.359> your<00:04:03.900> bullets<00:04:04.230> speed<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.890> one

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
lot off of your bullets speed and one

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.069 
lot off of your bullets speed and one
nice<00:04:05.310> thing<00:04:05.340> about<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:06.060> ump<00:04:06.540> weapons<00:04:06.930> in

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
nice thing about the ump weapons in

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.930 
nice thing about the ump weapons in
battlefield<00:04:07.380> 4<00:04:07.859> is<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:08.250> they<00:04:08.370> allow<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
battlefield 4 is that they allow you to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.990 
battlefield 4 is that they allow you to
have<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.290> underslung<00:04:10.290> spot<00:04:10.739> for<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> grip<00:04:11.459> not

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
have a underslung spot for a grip not

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.270 
have a underslung spot for a grip not
all<00:04:12.150> PDW<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.900> actually<00:04:13.260> have<00:04:13.380> rail<00:04:13.680> space<00:04:14.040> for

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
all PDW is actually have rail space for

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.620 
all PDW is actually have rail space for
a<00:04:14.310> grip<00:04:14.579> that's<00:04:14.820> something<00:04:15.120> you'll<00:04:15.269> notice

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
a grip that's something you'll notice

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.990 
a grip that's something you'll notice
with<00:04:15.840> guns<00:04:16.079> like<00:04:16.350> say<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> p90<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.789> don't

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
with guns like say the p90 you don't

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.909 
with guns like say the p90 you don't
actually<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.570> extra<00:04:19.320> accessory

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
actually have that extra accessory

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.850 
actually have that extra accessory
option<00:04:20.430> there<00:04:20.640> but<00:04:21.150> because<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.690> UMP<00:04:22.590> does

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
option there but because the UMP does

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.980 
option there but because the UMP does
allow<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.220> for<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.820> like<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.479> run<00:04:24.720> with

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
allow you for that I like to run with

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.280 
allow you for that I like to run with
the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.350 
the
ergo<00:04:25.560> grip<00:04:25.800> or<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.070> vertical<00:04:26.430> grip<00:04:26.730> because

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
ergo grip or the vertical grip because

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.600 
ergo grip or the vertical grip because
they're<00:04:27.540> basically<00:04:28.500> tightens<00:04:29.010> your<00:04:29.070> grouping

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
they're basically tightens your grouping

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.310 
they're basically tightens your grouping
of<00:04:29.730> fire<00:04:29.970> while<00:04:30.330> you're<00:04:30.570> on<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.840> move<00:04:30.870> which

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
of fire while you're on the move which

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.740 
of fire while you're on the move which
again<00:04:31.920> enhances<00:04:32.550> your<00:04:32.700> hipfire<00:04:32.850> capabilities

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
again enhances your hipfire capabilities

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.720 
again enhances your hipfire capabilities
and<00:04:34.080> if<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.380> get<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.560> use<00:04:34.740> sight<00:04:35.010> strafing<00:04:35.520> and

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
and if you get a use sight strafing and

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.430 
and if you get a use sight strafing and
dodging<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.300> win<00:04:36.480> firefights<00:04:37.080> then<00:04:37.290> it's

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
dodging to win firefights then it's

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.320 
dodging to win firefights then it's
going<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.740> be<00:04:37.920> excellent<00:04:38.400> since<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.150> gun

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
going to be excellent since the gun

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.180 
going to be excellent since the gun
isn't<00:04:39.540> particularly<00:04:40.320> effective<00:04:40.860> at<00:04:41.010> long

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
isn't particularly effective at long

range to begin with using something like

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.470 
range to begin with using something like
a<00:04:43.590> stubby<00:04:44.100> grip<00:04:44.130> or<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> potato<00:04:44.850> grip<00:04:45.180> really

a stubby grip or a potato grip really

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.090 
a stubby grip or a potato grip really
isn't<00:04:45.600> gonna<00:04:45.780> help<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.140> out<00:04:46.260> too<00:04:46.470> much<00:04:46.650> and

isn't gonna help you out too much and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
having an angled for grip again is it

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
having an angled for grip again is it
gonna<00:04:49.290> help<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.620> too<00:04:49.770> much<00:04:49.800> because<00:04:50.160> that

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.420 
gonna help you too much because that
first<00:04:50.610> shot<00:04:51.000> multiplier<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.050> low<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.620> really

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
first shot multiplier is so low I really

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.740 
first shot multiplier is so low I really
think<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.820> only<00:04:53.880> way<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.240> go<00:04:54.480> with<00:04:54.630> this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
think the only way to go with this

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.930 
think the only way to go with this
weapon<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.230> using<00:04:55.560> an<00:04:55.650> Ergo<00:04:56.010> or<00:04:56.250> vertical<00:04:56.730> grip

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
weapon is using an Ergo or vertical grip

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.430 
weapon is using an Ergo or vertical grip
so<00:04:57.270> I've<00:04:57.420> already<00:04:57.780> explained<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.380> I

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
so I've already explained that I

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.740 
so I've already explained that I
personally<00:04:58.860> like<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.460> run<00:04:59.730> with<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.940> laser<00:05:00.300> and

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
personally like to run with a laser and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.500 
personally like to run with a laser and
suppressor<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.800> most<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.280> my<00:05:02.310> PDW<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.360> say

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
suppressor for most of my PDW but say

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.000 
suppressor for most of my PDW but say
that's<00:05:03.720> not<00:05:03.900> your<00:05:03.960> style<00:05:04.350> say<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:04.710> want<00:05:04.950> to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
that's not your style say you want to

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.310 
that's not your style say you want to
get<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.250> most<00:05:05.580> accurate<00:05:05.970> hipfire<00:05:06.630> possible

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
get the most accurate hipfire possible

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320 
get the most accurate hipfire possible
well<00:05:07.770> instead<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.160> going<00:05:08.250> muzzle<00:05:08.850> brake<00:05:09.120> or

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
well instead of going muzzle brake or

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.180 
well instead of going muzzle brake or
compensator<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.530> recoil<00:05:10.890> on<00:05:11.010> this

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
compensator because the recoil on this

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.040 
compensator because the recoil on this
weapon<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.580> already<00:05:11.970> pretty<00:05:12.270> darn<00:05:12.540> low<00:05:12.810> I

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
weapon is already pretty darn low I

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.660 
weapon is already pretty darn low I
would<00:05:13.380> recommend<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.010> leaving<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.400> barrel

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
would recommend just leaving a barrel

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.580 
would recommend just leaving a barrel
attachment<00:05:14.970> off<00:05:15.330> or<00:05:15.780> going<00:05:16.050> for<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.320> flash

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
attachment off or going for the flash

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.590 
attachment off or going for the flash
hider<00:05:16.860> once<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.340> unlock<00:05:17.730> that<00:05:17.760> just<00:05:18.480> to

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
hider once you unlock that just to

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.360 
hider once you unlock that just to
maintain<00:05:18.750> your<00:05:19.140> really<00:05:19.500> accurate<00:05:19.980> hipfire

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
maintain your really accurate hipfire

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.040 
maintain your really accurate hipfire
and<00:05:20.610> keeping<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.090> laser<00:05:21.300> sight<00:05:21.600> on<00:05:21.840> there

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
and keeping the laser sight on there

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.870 
and keeping the laser sight on there
that's<00:05:22.230> gonna<00:05:22.710> be<00:05:22.890> a<00:05:22.920> really<00:05:23.160> good<00:05:23.370> way<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.610> go

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
that's gonna be a really good way to go

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.550 
that's gonna be a really good way to go
you'll<00:05:24.210> also<00:05:24.360> be<00:05:24.690> popping<00:05:25.290> up<00:05:25.410> on<00:05:25.530> the

mini-map when you fire which in some
ways<00:05:27.600> can<00:05:27.870> be<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.080> benefit<00:05:28.590> especially<00:05:28.800> if

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
ways can be a benefit especially if

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.560 
ways can be a benefit especially if

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
yes it is to unlock this weapon if you

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.810 
yes it is to unlock this weapon if you
have<00:06:38.840> the<00:06:38.960> ump45<00:06:39.590> there's<00:06:40.130> very<00:06:40.520> little

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
have the ump45 there's very little

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.570 
have the ump45 there's very little
reason<00:06:41.120> to<00:06:41.419> go<00:06:41.540> for<00:06:41.780> the<00:06:41.840> um<00:06:42.110> t9<00:06:42.530> the<00:06:43.009> recoil<00:06:43.400> is

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
reason to go for the um t9 the recoil is

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.340 
reason to go for the um t9 the recoil is
incredibly<00:06:44.180> easy<00:06:44.449> to<00:06:44.570> control<00:06:44.870> so<00:06:45.020> if<00:06:45.259> you

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
incredibly easy to control so if you

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.050 
incredibly easy to control so if you
don't<00:06:45.530> have<00:06:45.620> good<00:06:45.800> recoil<00:06:46.280> management<00:06:46.789> skills

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
don't have good recoil management skills

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.909 
don't have good recoil management skills
it<00:06:47.479> might<00:06:47.630> be<00:06:47.780> a<00:06:47.810> fun<00:06:48.050> weapon<00:06:48.410> for<00:06:48.620> you<00:06:48.710> but

it might be a fun weapon for you but

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.760 
it might be a fun weapon for you but
ultimately<00:06:49.490> I<00:06:49.820> would<00:06:50.180> say<00:06:50.360> the<00:06:50.479> ump45<00:06:51.169> makes

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
ultimately I would say the ump45 makes

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.830 
ultimately I would say the ump45 makes
this<00:06:51.949> weapon<00:06:52.190> obsolete<00:06:53.030> but<00:06:53.389> if<00:06:53.509> you're<00:06:53.660> like
