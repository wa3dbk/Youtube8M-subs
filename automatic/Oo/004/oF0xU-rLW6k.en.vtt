00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hi, the college has a mechanic 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.629
 engineer of the organ 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.970
 and this is a program and look for the part 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.970
 those who like to tinker on your bike 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:24.240
 the issue today is a starting relay and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 question is the tycoon's wheel it from there 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 college is also with the right time to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.009
 change my gender and change it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 RenÃ© correctly match has the function 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.590
 starting the engine 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.110
 but like other motorcycle parts it 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.969
 has a limited life the remedy of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 he has an estimated life in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.500
 normal conditions 50 thousand games later 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 it begins to give a defect 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.980
 found that the problem is in relief 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 of departure 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.680
 replace with a boom of the same 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.379
 after switching the starter relay 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.100
 we need to spend a clean contact 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.280
 here on the connector to improve the connection 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 electrical fit right remembering 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 here is a lock to lock the next 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.540
 step now is to measure the engine consumption 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.700
 of departure 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 why do you avoid burning? 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 of new remedies and the people 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.060
 need this instrument here is a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.030
 continuous chain pliers 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.770
 the procedure is as follows disable 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.890
 cause the ignition coil to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.970
 The spark plug cable is positioned 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.299
 perimeter in the possible battery field 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.299
 turn on the ignition key 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.090
 maximum peak current 39 amperes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.790
 according to the manufacturer's 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.400
 reach a maximum of 45 feet if you get 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.990
 current there, the starter motor indicates 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.450
 that needs to be replaced 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 done, that 's all right 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.869
 you have there 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.540
 if all goes well another 50 thousand matches 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.340
 now take care of the network starting at 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.650
 time to boot has to have a minimum 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.240
 which is not the case without 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.240
 notion there 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.200
 It's incredible but it's crazy out there. 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.489
 did not learn how to drive a motorcycle with 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.329
 responsibility for this hint of today 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.640
 The following is 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.739
 keep your license up to date and stay 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.980
 attentive to the Brazilian traffic code 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.959
 so people hope you like it 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.659
 enter the site of the magnetron program 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.560
 look at the piece and ask your question if 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.560
 to the next
