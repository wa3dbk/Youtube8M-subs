00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
cars are located around the middle of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.179 
cars are located around the middle of
the<00:01:02.730> map<00:01:03.530> there<00:01:04.530> aren't<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.159> very

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the map there aren't going to be very

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.870 
the map there aren't going to be very
many<00:01:05.640> cars<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> outskirts<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.590> town<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.640> if

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
many cars on the outskirts of town so if

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
many cars on the outskirts of town so if
you<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.210> too<00:01:09.450> far<00:01:09.689> away<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> edge<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you get too far away from the edge of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
you get too far away from the edge of
the<00:01:10.530> map<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.159> possibly<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.909> find

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the map you could possibly be find

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.530 
the map you could possibly be find
yourself<00:01:12.780> driving<00:01:13.049> around<00:01:13.470> by<00:01:13.979> yourself

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
yourself driving around by yourself

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
yourself driving around by yourself
looking<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.600> cars<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.350> finding<00:01:16.830> any<00:01:17.009> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
a great thing to do is immediately after

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.580 
a great thing to do is immediately after
you<00:01:20.009> kill<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> car<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:22.290> turn<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> slide

you kill a car to turn around do a slide

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.080 
you kill a car to turn around do a slide
then<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.950> did<00:01:26.130> earlier<00:01:26.280> spin<00:01:26.970> around

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
then like you did earlier spin around

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.170 
then like you did earlier spin around
180<00:01:27.689> degrees<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.200> drive<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
180 degrees and drive right back to the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
180 degrees and drive right back to the
center<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.110> map<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.799> following<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
center of the map and start following a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.539 
center of the map and start following a
car<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.659> are<00:01:33.689> pursuing<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.380> car<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.920> may
