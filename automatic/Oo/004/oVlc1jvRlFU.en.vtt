00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.150
 Colombia suffers again the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.150
 consequences of heavy rains 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.930
 -It's a thousand people but they seem so 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 indicated by the floods 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.579
 these impressive images of the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.039
 emergency caused by the overflow 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.170
 of the Bogotá river revealed the magnitude of 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.269
 the human and environmental tragedy as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.820
 consequence of excess sediment 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.159
 of the river that exhausted its capacity to 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.260
 store heavy rains and because 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.170
 the waters claimed land that was 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.530
 theirs and they were dried and occupied 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.330
 by man for agricultural purposes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.940
 livestock and urban 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.550
 another factor that decreased capacity 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.960
 of the river to drain its waters was the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.960
 garbage pollution 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.700
 is the river source of life or dumpster 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700
 flag 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.840
 since the capital was founded 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.090
 hundreds of years on the banks of the jet of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.729
 Quevedo its inhabitants have been 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.520
 contaminating the river and the tributaries that 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.039
 they flow into it with the passing of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.729
 the years the establishment of new 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.829
 municipalities and industrial growth 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.880
 the toxicity of its waters continued 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.100
 increasing however those step by the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.159
 capital when the river receives the most 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.860
 pollutant load produced by the 8 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.920
 million bogotanos these waters 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.380
 domestic residuals contribute 80 per 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.130
 percent of the pollution and 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:15.019
 industrial extractive mining and 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.780
 debris contribute the remaining 20% ​​the river 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.230
 that is born fit for human consumption is 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.140
 say with grade 1 begins to degrade 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 until you reach grade 4 just before 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.079
 receive the first toxic discharge from the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.569
 capital on 80 street across the river 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.510
 nitrate this download takes it from 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.989
 immediate to the degree 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.970
 that is, it is totally contaminated 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.790
 condition that remains with the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.110
 later discharges of the fucha rivers 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.480
 on 13th street and the tunjuelo in soacha 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.360
 these tributaries also deposit 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.989
 river bogota the garbage thrown to the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.299
 streets that because of the rain 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.740
 roll to the sewers and arrive 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.080
 to them 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.570
 the tributaries behave like three 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.860
 big tubes that carry solids like 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.650
 bags plastic bottles packaging 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.890
 icopor of difficult degradation and 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.390
 tons of schoolgirls rims and 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.960
 tires 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.700
 they also transport to the river bogotá 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.569
 everything that is deposited in siphon is and 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.130
 health as diapers preservatives 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.540
 disposable cooking oils 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.810
 detergents and fats 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.410
 all this has led to the Bogota river 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.130
 be a dead river 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.720
 that runs slow 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:49.640
 without microbiotic flora and fauna without 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.940
 oxygen without life 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.940
 do not 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.600
 in February of the year 2013 the corporation 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.040
 autonomous regional government of cundinamarca car 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.080
 launched the ambitious mega 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.810
 hydraulic adequacy project and 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.940
 environmental recovery of the river bogotá el 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.760
 project aims to mitigate so 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.350
 definitively the flood risk in 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.239
 the middle basin of the river bogotá of a 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.580
 part and part 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.840
 contribute to the decontamination of 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.150
 river in relation to education 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.460
 hydraulics we are already advancing the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.680
 first phase from the known sector 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.240
 like ali cachina up to 13th street a 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.550
 second phase and 13th street to there 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.530
 80 and a third of 80 street to the road 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.270
 up-level sector known as account 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.320
 the virgin the recovery works 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.580
 Hydraulics have an urban component 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.530
 landscaping that will allow the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.080
 use of river banks 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.849
 for its integration to the capital of 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.819
 country 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.399
 at this moment the city is giving 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.339
 back to the river with the construction of 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:56.020
 this longitudinal park we want is that 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.809
 the community has a site of 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.360
 entertainment and where you can be at 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:06.069
 side of a clean river are going to be planted 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.520
 about 150 160 thousand trees in about 50 60 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.529
 native species are swallowing the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.240
 riverbed in some places with a 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.490
 depth of up to 8 meters we are 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.919
 also expanding the channel that today has 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.649
 an average of 30 meters wide 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.409
 take it to 60 meters building about 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:25.839
 marginal slopes or jarillones the 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.909
 execution of the works required a 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:30.969
 land purchase process for 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:33.849
 improve the layout of the river and return 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:36.099
 the areas of natural flood 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.050
 the world bank participates with a 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.319
 loan operation that has two 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.580
 components the first one and why not 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:47.649
 resources are identified in this case 250 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.959
 million dollars for a loan to 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:53.440
 the box and the second in our concept 

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:55.360
 technical assistance is more important 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.790
 the second component of this project 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.200
 which is the expansion and optimization of 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.670
 the water treatment plant 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.530
 residual saltpeter 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.630
 with an investment that is around 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.040
 the 400 million dollars have to be 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.020
 keep in mind that Bogota is 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.390
 investing about 20 cubic meters 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.240
 per second of wastewater from the 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.760
 which only 4 are being treated in 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.860
 the saltpeter plant will need to 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.600
 Bogota build that second plant that 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.380
 would correspond to the plant located in 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.080
 Canoes sector 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:30.370
 the work contract is executed by the 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.530
 spanish firm efe ss construction for 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.190
 we are very important this 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.650
 performance 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.360
 fcc colombia is part of a group 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.240
 called fcc services 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.700
 citizens where our vocation is 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.770
 improve the welfare and quality of 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.430
 people the last beneficiaries of 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.860
 performances like this one 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.190
 the hydraulic recovery of the river 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.460
 Bogota in the middle basin is a dream 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:59.190
 that the corporation makes these 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.590
 works are the initial payment of 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.330
 the old environmental debt that you have 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:08.730
 with the river but his total recovery is 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:12.900
 responsibility of all of the companies 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:16.890
 the institutions the national government 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.680
 the mayorships and of each of the 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:22.590
 inhabitants that were the river that what 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.300
 respect that they do not throw away garbage like 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.300
 we are seeing them at this moment 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:34.980
 the dream of seeing the river bogotá at the gym 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:39.900
 I live flooding controlled is 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:42.000
 possible the hope is real but all 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.310
 without exception we must act to 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.230
 guarantee the survival of life 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.230
 in all its forms 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.020
 I point
