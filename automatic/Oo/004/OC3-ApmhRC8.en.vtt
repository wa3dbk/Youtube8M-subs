00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.280
 of the video for more information 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.280
 outside the world if the main channel of 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.139
 youyube from hey lewis mexico and this time 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.710
 the long jing accompanies me again in 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.869
 this iceberg in onis west beige or 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.440
 base on side or second third 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.340
 mission of the campaign in difficulty 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.600
 normal who do but the good game 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.000
 this 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.920
 as I said we are in beige uniform 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.220
 let's do a mystery called ridge 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 racer or races in reach for this there 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.420
 to pass the mission in a normal way 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.940
 thank God he left and you have to pass the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.700
 mission in normal way until the part 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.870
 let me tell you return to the base once there 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.790
 they're going to put themselves in a location in the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.820
 which right now I'll tell you first 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.410
 I went to activate the antennas no matter 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.989
 really if they go first for the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.810
 anti-aircraft or if you want to activate 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 antennas first I in this case I went 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.830
 first by the antennas because I wanted 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.990
 leave long skin that the in its location 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.470
 where are you where you are 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.659
 a switch for this both players 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.659
 because two players are required 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.830
 to perform this distraction both 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.650
 players must be on a switch and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.030
 activate it simultaneously the switches 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.820
 They are in different locations 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.790
 within the same mission and right now in 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.790
 this moment I will guide you towards them 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.370
 to them rather be here in 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.950
 part of the antennas we see a waterfall 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.280
 frozen or something like that and right in this 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.800
 good rock there I was trying to look 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.130
 where was the switch until I 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.470
 stop at the right place here and I know 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.650
 hold down x to open door if 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.070
 activate it nothing will happen but if 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.070
 activate simultaneously 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.910
 the easter exalts correctly but it is 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.350
 you better activate it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.040
 Simultaneously do not try to activate it 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.269
 before 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.530
 maybe it will not work then we continue 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:25.290
 I'm going to advance this I'm still on a path 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.540
 where there are no enemies where you already clear and 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.510
 well it was already cleared like that from the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.099
 start there are several that several routes that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.099
 they connect to the same center 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.859
 and really good can use their routes 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.719
 personal for example I first arrived 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.489
 to the antennas now I'm heading towards the 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.489
 previous in this ghost 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.890
 I have to obviously eliminate the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.890
 enemies from here 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.650
 requirements to do the ready is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.150
 well I told you third mission 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.390
 un adviser of normal difficulty 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 normal up do not need 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.300
 skulls or anything activated and so that 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.110
 It depends on your taste 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.410
 I'm still here ending with enemies 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.180
 I forgot to activate 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.180
 anti-aircraft and I got off there 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:29.060
 and good basically and I explained everything not 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.620
 I know what to say the point is that right now 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.290
 once activated forward to it goes to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.680
 say to go back to the south base of 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.799
 the un 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.099
 and they really are not going to do that right now 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.069
 I'm going to jump to another little bit here 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.769
 for 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.620
 explain them from here they will take as 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.629
 reference is this side are going to go up 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.760
 towards these rocks that I am 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:57.430
 climbing and here until you see this 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.620
 landscape on base in half destroyed 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.269
 and here do not activate it at that time 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.379
 because I was doing the account 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.209
 regressive to press it 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.290
 simultaneously and that there was no mistake 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.280
 in interest and once you activate it 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.870
 is going to be target current load sandwich 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.680
 then the moment he teleports 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.410
 in going to say boot or something like this one does not 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.410
 it shows because it's in cinema so 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.310
 good but in the game itself yes it is going to 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.640
 show and this part where they start not 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.320
 is clear enemies so there is something 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.340
 of risks at the moment d 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.970
 do the ritz says although that's 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.430
 pretty funny according to me if a 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.249
 person dies does not reappear in vehicles 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.829
 as in the game d 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:54.819
 of multiplayer racing so 

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:56.919
 well you can also get out in your 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:00.399
 vehicle and grab other vehicles if 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.589
 they do not like the great golf great keeper or 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.919
 a king fernando here I turned around 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.509
 we were crazy that I was 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.379
 fighting for the first place because 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:13.629
 it turns out that yes, this can be done 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.369
 of two or more people I 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.969
 I would recommend that more people 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:23.489
 because the first place when it reaches the 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.489
 This goal makes others explode 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.710
 and good 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.960
 here we see how long jing and I are 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.250
 somewhat even but I pass it 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.440
 quickly here I almost turned to almost 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.990
 almost 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.050
 can continue later with the campaign 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.170
 normal clear after finishing with these 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.170
 enemies reached the goal and luccÃ­n that 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.480
 explodes and then appears next to me and 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.100
 we will see once the camera once 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.460
 more on the camera longue singh like 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.890
 exploits well I hope it has been 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.760
 to your liking subscribe for more videos 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.770
 like these 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.040
 I'm fail or more and for the youtube channel 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.250
 from hitler which mexico and until the 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.250
 next
