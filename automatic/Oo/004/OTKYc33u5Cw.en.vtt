00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.949
 to to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 2 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.029
 for this we need 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.019
 plastic 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.789
 about 25 minutes 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.220
 There is no third 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 golden quarter 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.399
 according to her director 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.399
 rated 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.890
 most common 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.580
 nameplates 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.150
 investors and it is alarming 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.750
 in the amount of salary that my mind 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.850
 it's nice 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.840
 cut off 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 just plastic 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040
 so the edge we have processed 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 a series of operators with hardware qwerty 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.850
 because of the old world so the irregularities of it 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 and terrible 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 we will not 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 Here is a sign 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 I'm based on need 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 then I understand the sick when 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 in h 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.180
 it is necessary 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 internal parts 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.150
 manat 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 wonderful 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 so attach to conflicts 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.310
 and then 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.189
 it will be possible to replicate our 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.770
 enterprises and then organizing around the edge 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.770
 one way out 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.929
 the sign is almost ready
