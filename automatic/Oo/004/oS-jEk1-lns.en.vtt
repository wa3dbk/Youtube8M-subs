00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
grind with the triangle or /why you jump

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
grind with the triangle or /why you jump
you<00:01:51.360> flip<00:01:51.720> tricky<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.590> flip<00:01:52.890> trick<00:01:53.100> exactly

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you flip tricky not flip trick exactly

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.429 
you flip tricky not flip trick exactly
but<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.720> basically<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.229> tony

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but you know it's basically the tony

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.380 
but you know it's basically the tony
hawk<00:01:55.590> concept<00:01:56.100> which<00:01:56.280> i<00:01:56.399> cannot<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.000> about

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hawk concept which i cannot like about

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
hawk concept which i cannot like about
this<00:01:57.600> game<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:59.189> game<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.549> somewhere

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
this game the game was somewhere

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940 
this game the game was somewhere
successful<00:02:00.540> though<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.259> i<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.770> that's

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
successful though and i think that's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
successful though and i think that's
pretty<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.759> Tony<00:02:03.329> Hawk<00:02:03.540> was

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
pretty much because Tony Hawk was

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
pretty much because Tony Hawk was
getting<00:02:04.049> free<00:02:04.200> definitely<00:02:04.799> overshadow<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
getting free definitely overshadow this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600 
getting free definitely overshadow this
game<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.840> came<00:02:07.049> out<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> same<00:02:07.500> time<00:02:07.950> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
game they came out at the same time but

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.529 
game they came out at the same time but
I<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> demo<00:02:09.360> version<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.080> known

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
I think the demo version is more known

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.140 
I think the demo version is more known
the<00:02:10.629> actual<00:02:11.260> game<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.769> know<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.849> still

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the actual game you know but I still

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.850 
the actual game you know but I still
think<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.420> game<00:02:13.659> is<00:02:13.750> very<00:02:13.870> fun<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.439> I've

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
think this game is very fun and I've

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.009 
think this game is very fun and I've
never<00:02:15.069> had<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.370> game<00:02:15.640> though<00:02:15.849> as<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.840> saw

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
never had this game though as you saw

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.440 
never had this game though as you saw
that<00:02:17.200> by<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.439> way<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.620> did<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> revert<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.730> you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
that by the way I did a revert and you

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.470 
that by the way I did a revert and you
know<00:02:19.599> revert<00:02:20.110> yes<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:21.069> think<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:22.030> when<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.420> was

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
know revert yes I think that when I was

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.850 
know revert yes I think that when I was
scared<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> free<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.470> like<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.829> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
scared of free and this like in the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.190 
scared of free and this like in the
first<00:02:24.069> game<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.150> definitely<00:02:25.629> just<00:02:25.989> a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
first game so it's definitely just a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.740 
first game so it's definitely just a
Tony<00:02:26.409> Hart<00:02:26.650> feeling<00:02:27.099> offered<00:02:27.879> but<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.480> still

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
Tony Hart feeling offered but I still

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.089 
Tony Hart feeling offered but I still
like<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.140> game<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.709> I'll<00:02:29.860> play<00:02:30.040> this
