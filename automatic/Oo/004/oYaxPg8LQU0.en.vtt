00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.609
 I saw these terrain 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.939
 The iPhone is going to be eight years at room temperature. 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.480
 Did your eyes change? 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.829
 So wearing a big flood 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.999
 With this in mind 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.029
 I know. 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.800
 This should be explained with a description 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.350
 I have found that there are so many of them. 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.570
 As the first evidence of this, 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.040
 What I can think of is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.770
 Continental 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.559
 No content 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.500
 The fact that you are going to form for 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 You can put this first 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.010
 Where 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.490
 You know me well. 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.100
 grand canyon 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 America's Arizona Can 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.220
 Do it with Utah 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.920
 Grand Canyon 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.370
 It's famous for its deep valleys. 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.780
 as etri 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.000
 Through ic valley we are in between 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 You can see instructions 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.939
 Very thick sediments are thicker mechanical layers 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.939
 Well 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 it industry becomes the secretary general 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.730
 How about Oliveira? 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.120
 I have reduced some. Father m 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.150
 I think I can do that. 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 You can stay and spend, install and look at it. 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.970
 What happened here is 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.780
 I was impressed by the temple, which is the site this year 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.450
 There 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780
 The store may have four days. 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.080
 There are many different guidelines 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.430
 If you look at the guidelines on cleanliness 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.600
 That's enough when I'm cheap 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.160
 Yes, this is the map of the USA. 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.410
 The portion marked as playful 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.240
 Any instructions 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.190
 Sangam Sands is abolished in stock 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.460
 So if this is important at the end of the month 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.680
 The same material is sandy 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.709
 Eat only in the area 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.339
 It is said that it is editorial over. 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.259
 You know well that America's land is not marching. 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.059
 In such a large area 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.500
 Monet is as big as the market 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.780
 I can fight like this even if I can reach out to Canada. 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.129
 What is the way to monitor 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.619
 The wind can fight 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.219
 Short 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.569
 Or corporation 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.549
 I wonder if these things can fight in that way. 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.589
 Try 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.429
 Impossible 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.299
 This is when it comes to scale 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.299
 Those things can fight 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.739
 This must be the size of a pure ocean 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.129
 Someone else thinks like this. 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.760
 Once upon a time, 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.639
 Continent 2 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.060
 20 on the sea 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.159
 There is also a child sk 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.529
 Because it was deep in the sea, I expected that season 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.790
 I climbed into the courage. I think that part of you 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.559
 I have it 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.749
 if at sea 82.0 and shallow sea 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:09.739
 It is possible to distinguish sediments on land 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.180
 Because it is such a day after tomorrow, if you join, you can take it deeply and accumulate it. 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.870
 There is not. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.139
 There is sand 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.949
 There is a good chance that the sand will come from a water source, 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.409
 When I go back 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.549
 I am already growing all over the world. 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.680
 Only small particles are far away 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.209
 You can float in the deep sea. 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.840
 General election 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.999
 It is a sediment on land. 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.650
 The substance is on land. 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.259
 The size of the sea in terms of scale 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.189
 if so 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.769
 What do you say when you think about it together? 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.669
 Large corporations 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.499
 Have you seen anything? 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.269
 It was said that the sea had never been 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.199
 the table. No matter how 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.069
 At this time, 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.859
 In abstract 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.799
 That material can build up 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.499
 On this principle 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.139
 Grand canyon wrote such a public debt that can be seen from the ground stacked 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.509
 You thought you had a score 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:12.979
 in reality 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.909
 75 percent of the medical profession is ongoing. 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.009
 There is. 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.509
 There's no water right now. 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.900
 Between $ 100 million 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.169
 I can fight those instructions 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.169
 I do not see much of it, though 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.069
 j179 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.879
 5% 75% of the surface is made of silver 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.470
 This explains how we should explain exceptions 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.159
 We are not the continents 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.080
 Sea water 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.360
 I wrote a universal that I can easily understand if I think so 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.629
 Will 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:47.129
 Well,
