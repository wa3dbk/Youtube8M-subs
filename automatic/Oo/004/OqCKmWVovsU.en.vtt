the Ruger LCR really is a revolution in
revolver<00:00:12.690> technology<00:00:13.349> started<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

recoil<00:01:10.400> benefits<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.939> 22<00:01:12.479> caliber<00:01:12.720> LCR

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
recoil benefits of the 22 caliber LCR
and<00:01:13.710> put<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.970> package<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> lot

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and put that in a package with a lot

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.020 
and put that in a package with a lot
more<00:01:16.110> muzzle<00:01:16.380> energies<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.369> becomes<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
more muzzle energies so it becomes a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
more muzzle energies so it becomes a
viable<00:01:18.470> alternative<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.650> those<00:01:20.040> who<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.369> to

viable alternative for those who want to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
viable alternative for those who want to
carry<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.030> LCR<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.630> self-defense<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.799> may

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
carry the LCR for self-defense but may

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
carry the LCR for self-defense but may
have<00:01:23.250> trouble<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.700> recoil<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.900> gives

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
have trouble with recoil so this gives

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
have trouble with recoil so this gives
them<00:01:25.439> an<00:01:25.619> option<00:01:26.100> now<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> same<00:01:26.909> great

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
