00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.430
 OK, we use the CSS box models 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.429
 and why in operation has CSS and a resounding effect 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.979
 that looks pattern cleats this Buxtehude 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.609
 with crests our room a single elements 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.199
 that we can be PS that we can Hollenstein the child 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.399
 be something 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.659
 this element definitely has my content here as an example in the text 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.300
 in addition there's 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.550
 never to distance yourself from this content 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 indicated here in the money 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.360
 to Rotenburg 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.550
 Beijing so I can do so in coordination with yellow and this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.590
 Beijing announced small size with give 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.440
 either build hicks 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 absolute 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.680
 he went with 10 pixels 110 pixel pitch 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 Unger relative Beijing with Smola just 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.470
 Net 2 distance 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.620
 Of course, this is what keeps the distance apart 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.180
 because the next thing I have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.790
 he is Bordeaux 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.580
 that is all one more element 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.710
 have the kindergartens in mind 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.180
 So according to our content 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.250
 the cribs distance to the frame 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.920
 and so a construction Burma research we can see very open 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 Enemies give each set as nomads 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.650
 Distance to the porn 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.220
 another piece on top 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 the Port Authority also fits in with them 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.970
 or even at a distance here is still the possibility that one 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.720
 Background VB 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.060
 can turn on 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.640
 for this element 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.470
 called this Beckord Kagawas inform 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.220
 3d transistors are shown that has powered up this keep 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700
 then Hamas in the background 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.780
 shines through 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.190
 in addition 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.340
 have to this background 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.910
 do not give care from the distance 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.570
 to the next element Quaas 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.820
 Left Right 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 make the luminous where 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.380
 that's outside pay 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.200
 the data can Martschin 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.909
 will be back too 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.209
 possible are just as absurd as relatively quiet then says 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.099
 Dimming distance to the next element 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.359
 and 20 pixels 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.919
 Oaktree m or whatever and set for each page individually 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.009
 as well as the Ki Moon distance for each page individually tune one adjustable 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.069
 the mini car Bordeaux is a swear word for each side individually 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:35.049
 they have him distance common big distance i've never been behind and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.969
 Paolo I can give with me 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.260
 to put pressure again I still can not 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
 Wallpaper give this trend 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.009
 So I have my text 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.109
 then there appears the background Pulk 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.829
 Of course, I'm never behind reason 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:52.949
 Background color 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.369
 should not be a wallpaper 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.739
 and the background color is displayed 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.739
 all this refers to a single element 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.079
 that runs and this term Books Fashion 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 here must be complete 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.049
 if I too 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.399
 Pay on Band 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.729
 I can give the team after Stein 30 pixels from Beijing 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.729
 if I now this right upper left and then goes 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.749
 Alaaf everything around it 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.259
 Gives the construction of 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.180
 a pixel 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.829
 if I do not have a military service upstairs and you go 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.609
 Güls dies fame 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.339
 you can go with the mountain wall 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.689
 in the case of this blue here 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.009
 Button at the back 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.809
 if no picture presented background Bommel Winnenden because it counts the picture 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.719
 outside distance give Marchi 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.579
 if I'm not right upper left and a flowered for everything else 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.199
 can also make Bertha legal service different 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.199
 and i can make background go clean up image 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.120
 that will be displayed 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.120
 the text is the 4th 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.869
 and the mother behind this box is just a lot of power behind it 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.389
 this applies to every element, whether EHEC 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.689
 on h1 Ropraz Qu as well on goal 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.600
 they can also give a background picture, for example 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.499
 Can give Meron 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.499
 at a distance great distances in a certain way 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.759
 there is something going on 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.759
 Moth, I have to do that too 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.110
 you have in Bustfeld now on it 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.309
 pretty easy 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.620
 what we want to do it 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.229
 that feeds 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.629
 behind us so heading hr1 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.629
 the Solon one sometimes keep more distance to the outside 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.659
 to them 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.469
 and get so full in the background and in addition Wollmann picture in the 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.050
 Put in the background 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.879
 Picture in the background three lege always stood the question where to take from if not 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.169
 steal 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.400
 the fastest version 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.870
 okay 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.130
 is skillful pictures and pies UN 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.169
 Bern Nordkap Reisen is indeed a holder to reshuffle in any case 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.059
 this should be baptism 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.330
 technically do not look so accurate because this is completely different technique 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.069
 there are maps on the pictures and "Down Under" Topolino will wake up 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.680
 there 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.710
 from the post 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.110
 that is exciting 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.409
 how to get the pictures Bern 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.559
 If you try the pictures come singly "we can get one in your luggage 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.110
 look at the text 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.110
 Cook that he has this Büttner shelter on the hard drive 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.710

 the community Reken 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.000
 Property two 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.990
 no matter if here now 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.710
 small waterfall or small look should be fooled into the background 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.710
 been from the h1 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.889
 some already quite good and ask the task to black and white Poss has 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.479
 the main or shelter so Larson in the heart of 30 Pechstein have 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.860

 and 60 pixels the background image 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.499
 what is the direct not from the website and amounts 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.979
 then you cover her 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.900
 reach the clock then he only gets the picture displayed 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.900
 Right mouse button exchange partner under
