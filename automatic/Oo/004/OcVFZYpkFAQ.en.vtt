the best way to go about countered re so
first<00:00:52.879> of<00:00:53.000> all<00:00:53.030> let's<00:00:53.300> take<00:00:53.630> a<00:00:53.690> look<00:00:53.840> about

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
first of all let's take a look about

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.960 
first of all let's take a look about
what<00:00:54.350> what<00:00:54.800> makes<00:00:55.040> starry<00:00:55.310> starry<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:55.850> as

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
what what makes starry starry so as

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.790 
what what makes starry starry so as
positive<00:00:56.329> hemorrhage<00:00:56.690> every<00:00:57.260> auto<00:00:57.440> attack

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
positive hemorrhage every auto attack

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.590 
positive hemorrhage every auto attack
and<00:00:58.040> disabilities<00:00:58.610> apply<00:00:58.880> this<00:00:58.940> debuff

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
and disabilities apply this debuff

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.060 
and disabilities apply this debuff
hemorrhage<00:01:00.050> which<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.440> stacks<00:01:00.649> up<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.920> five

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
hemorrhage which the stacks up to five

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.819 
hemorrhage which the stacks up to five
times<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.550> deals<00:01:02.090> magic<00:01:02.570> damage<00:01:02.720> that<00:01:03.440> scales

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
times and deals magic damage that scales

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.219 
times and deals magic damage that scales
on<00:01:04.040> physical<00:01:04.460> damage<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.119> does<00:01:05.300> deal<00:01:05.479> magic

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
on physical damage so it does deal magic

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.620 
on physical damage so it does deal magic
damage<00:01:06.380> over<00:01:07.160> time<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.790> what<00:01:08.479> does

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
damage over time and what does

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.150 
damage over time and what does
hemorrhoids<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.290> does<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.740> affects<00:01:10.009> some

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
hemorrhoids also does is it affects some

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.480 
hemorrhoids also does is it affects some
of<00:01:10.250> its<00:01:10.369> abilities<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:11.360> decimate<00:01:11.899> Q<00:01:12.380> is<00:01:13.160> his

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
of its abilities so decimate Q is his

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.480 
of its abilities so decimate Q is his
AoE<00:01:13.759> like<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.270> looks<00:01:14.450> like<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.890> as

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
AoE like that looks like this and it as

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
you can see this outer radius here if

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.930 
you can see this outer radius here if

than<00:01:21.530> vs.<00:01:21.860> if<00:01:21.979> you're<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.280> inside<00:01:22.640> and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
than vs. if you're in the inside and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.910 
than vs. if you're in the inside and
obviously<00:01:23.720> like<00:01:23.899> if<00:01:24.050> you're<00:01:24.289> outside<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.890> a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
obviously like if you're outside is a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.820 
obviously like if you're outside is a
pretty<00:01:25.250> short<00:01:25.400> range<00:01:25.670> that's<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:26.390> oh<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.710> is

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
pretty short range that's it is oh it is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.380 
pretty short range that's it is oh it is
pretty<00:01:28.010> easy<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.369> avoid<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.210> stand

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
pretty easy to avoid so if you stand

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.000 
pretty easy to avoid so if you stand
outside<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.960> don't<00:01:30.080> take<00:01:30.200> any<00:01:30.350> damage<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:30.860> if

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
outside you don't take any damage but if

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.230 
outside you don't take any damage but if
you<00:01:31.130> know<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.520> absolutely<00:01:31.940> he's<00:01:32.060> going<00:01:32.180> to

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.399 
you know that absolutely he's going to
hit<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.540> there's<00:01:32.690> no<00:01:32.810> way<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.960> avoid<00:01:33.140> it

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
just dipped in a little bit so he

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.520 
just dipped in a little bit so he
doesn't<00:01:35.240> deal<00:01:35.510> as<00:01:35.720> much<00:01:35.750> damage<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.439> if

slow<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.510> no<00:03:54.720> mobility<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:56.040> no<00:03:56.220> escape<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:56.790> he's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
slow is no mobility is no escape so he's

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.520 
slow is no mobility is no escape so he's
really<00:03:57.150> easy<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.660> gank<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.349> thing

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
really easy to gank that's the thing

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.020 
really easy to gank that's the thing
like<00:03:58.680> if<00:03:58.739> your<00:03:58.950> jungler<00:03:59.250> comes<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.700> in<00:03:59.849> gang

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
time if before six you don't even know

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.180 
time if before six you don't even know
it's<00:04:03.780> gonna<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.049> an<00:04:04.109> absolutely<00:04:04.500> free<00:04:04.919> kill

now<00:04:05.940> his<00:04:06.269> Q<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.750> like<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.989> said<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.169> pretty<00:04:07.349> short

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
now his Q is like I said a pretty short

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.409 
now his Q is like I said a pretty short
range<00:04:08.190> it's<00:04:08.459> also<00:04:08.609> has<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.880> pretty<00:04:09.060> high<00:04:09.150> mana

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
range it's also has a pretty high mana

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.349 
range it's also has a pretty high mana
cost<00:04:09.660> elavil<00:04:10.200> as<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.859> levels<00:04:11.130> increase<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:11.940> if

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
cost elavil as the levels increase so if

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.909 
cost elavil as the levels increase so if
he<00:04:12.540> does<00:04:12.690> spam<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.049> he<00:04:13.169> will<00:04:13.319> run<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.650> pretty

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
he does spam it he will run in pretty

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.559 
he does spam it he will run in pretty
fast<00:04:14.069> unless<00:04:14.340> you'd<00:04:14.579> running<00:04:14.790> GP<00:04:15.060> tens<00:04:15.299> philo

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
fast unless you'd running GP tens philo

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.240 
fast unless you'd running GP tens philo
stone<00:04:15.900> which<00:04:16.289> just<00:04:16.530> means<00:04:16.680> he's<00:04:16.859> more<00:04:17.039> prone

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
stone which just means he's more prone

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.740 
stone which just means he's more prone
to<00:04:17.280> gangs<00:04:17.579> because<00:04:18.120> he's<00:04:18.269> not<00:04:18.359> hitting<00:04:18.599> his

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
to gangs because he's not hitting his

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.330 
to gangs because he's not hitting his
hard<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.049> he's<00:04:19.169> also<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.680> doesn't<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
hard and he's also like doesn't have the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.370 
hard and he's also like doesn't have the
mobility<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:21.000> tankiness<00:04:21.419> stuff<00:04:22.200> like

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
mobility or the tankiness stuff like

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.620 
mobility or the tankiness stuff like
that<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.310> too<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.760> w<00:04:24.090> there<00:04:24.240> isn't<00:04:24.419> really<00:04:24.479> a

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
that so too is w there isn't really a

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.450 
that so too is w there isn't really a
way<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.840> avoid<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.349> like<00:04:25.889> I<00:04:25.979> said<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.370> an

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
way to avoid it like I said it's just an

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.180 
way to avoid it like I said it's just an
auto<00:04:26.639> attack<00:04:26.910> right<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.680> if<00:04:28.680> he<00:04:28.860> gets<00:04:29.010> close

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
auto attack right so if he gets close

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.500 
auto attack right so if he gets close
enough<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.580> he's<00:04:29.760> going<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.030> auto<00:04:30.210> attack

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
enough to you he's going to auto attack

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.610 
enough to you he's going to auto attack
and<00:04:30.720> there's<00:04:30.870> something<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.169> really<00:04:31.349> you<00:04:31.470> can

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
and there's something you really you can

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.170 
and there's something you really you can
do<00:04:31.710> about<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.490> basically<00:04:32.700> just<00:04:32.880> have<00:04:33.000> to

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
do about it you basically just have to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.620 
do about it you basically just have to
sit<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:33.389> and<00:04:33.690> eat<00:04:33.960> his<00:04:35.030> auto<00:04:36.030> attack<00:04:36.360> if<00:04:36.539> he

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
sit there and eat his auto attack if he

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.810 
sit there and eat his auto attack if he
does<00:04:36.810> get<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.050> range<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.320> use<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.820> apprehend

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
does get in range to use it apprehend

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.879 
does get in range to use it apprehend
now<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.840> pretty<00:04:40.200> short<00:04:40.620> range

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
now this is it is a pretty short range

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.890 
now this is it is a pretty short range
but<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.460> teemo's<00:04:41.820> auto<00:04:42.030> attack<00:04:42.330> at<00:04:42.510> least<00:04:42.719> if

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
but it teemo's auto attack at least if

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.690 
but it teemo's auto attack at least if
your<00:04:43.349> auto<00:04:43.500> attacking<00:04:43.800> at<00:04:44.010> max<00:04:44.219> range<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.610> he

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
your auto attacking at max range and he

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.430 
your auto attacking at max range and he
stakes<00:04:45.000> like<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.419> step<00:04:45.659> forward<00:04:45.870> he<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.260> drag

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
stakes like one step forward he can drag

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.080 
stakes like one step forward he can drag
you<00:04:46.590> in

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
you in

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.250 
you in
timo<00:04:47.300> does<00:04:47.480> have<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.630> really<00:04:47.840> short<00:04:47.960> auto

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
timo does have a really short auto

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.340 
timo does have a really short auto
attack<00:04:48.530> granted<00:04:48.980> but<00:04:49.580> still<00:04:50.139> nidalee<00:04:51.139> is

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
attack granted but still nidalee is

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.960 
attack granted but still nidalee is
pretty<00:04:51.889> safe<00:04:52.040> in<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.310> especially<00:04:52.790> with<00:04:52.880> the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
pretty safe in this especially with the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.360 
pretty safe in this especially with the
bushes<00:04:53.300> but<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.410> way<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.650> avoid<00:04:54.949> this<00:04:55.130> is

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
bushes but the the way to avoid this is

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.990 
bushes but the the way to avoid this is
people<00:04:55.699> don't<00:04:56.060> really<00:04:56.180> understand<00:04:56.600> this<00:04:56.770> the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
people don't really understand this the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.879 
people don't really understand this the
