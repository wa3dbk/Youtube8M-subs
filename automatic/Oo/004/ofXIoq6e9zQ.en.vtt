all fire logs are not crash logs this is

all fire logs are not crash logs this is
an<00:00:16.470> example<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.609> mod<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.199> will<00:00:19.439> isolate

an example the mod that we will isolate

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.840 
an example the mod that we will isolate
that<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.550> causing<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.630> spam<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.500> time<00:00:22.850> is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
that is causing the spam this time is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.330 
that is causing the spam this time is
not<00:00:24.240> broken<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.230> being<00:00:25.529> used<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.099> an

not broken it is being used as an

example ah just let's get that out of
the<00:00:29.220> way<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:30.810> next<00:00:31.289> thing<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.949> need<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the way the next thing that you need to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.729 
the way the next thing that you need to
consider<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.030> while<00:00:33.899> common<00:00:34.380> sense

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
consider is that while common sense

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.150 
consider is that while common sense
would<00:00:35.250> direct<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.050> loose<00:00:37.410> scripts

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
would direct you to the loose scripts

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.619 
would direct you to the loose scripts
folder<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.680> your<00:00:42.170> Skyrim<00:00:43.170> data<00:00:43.440> folder<00:00:44.629> this

is<00:00:45.989> probably<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> most<00:00:47.399> difficult<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is probably the most difficult way to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200 
is probably the most difficult way to
troubleshoot<00:00:49.379> where<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.550> scripts<00:00:50.940> came

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
troubleshoot where these scripts came
