00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.650
 The next party is now on the defensive farms were run in the woods 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.730
 I literally turn this on r3 stick 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 This is the direction of turning 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.960
 Now the player has a right hand on which handler this handler has to help. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.940
 It's the left hand. 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.570
 It depends on the hand holding the ball and I am down here 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:36.430
 It depends on where you are. 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:42.699
 If you look at me, I have an orall ball. When I put the ball in my right hand, 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:44.469
 If you turn it like this on the right side , 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.199
 I am drunk 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.350
 I mean, pretending to be Spirals. 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 Here, 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.739
 Now if I do this and return the skill Yeah, I would have left Writer 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.290
 It's like this. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:08.729
 Next time, serve your guard and give it back to the real one. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.630
 So now, when you play the other way around, you 're looking at it now . 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.159
 Honestly, Turn this way, while you pretend to spend this money in any way 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.159
 So I figured a condensed yet 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.299
 So if you move around like this, it's different. 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.450
 So for example if the iron I move in this direction sections 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.450
 Spins 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 So turn around again 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:45.200
 But to do so, Turn the fabric in place when this place so 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.420
 Toro is so little copper stack Act 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:55.520
 I can use both of these. If I get vomited later in the process, 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.630
 This can break through and turn it to the next while the diameter of bread ah 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.590
 It is the same 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.229
 Now, look at your father's heart . Give me painting motion. 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.229
 In this way we will catch the ball today 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.179
 Again, pay more and 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.950
 And then I'll try it again. 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 Now you can use it like this 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.760
 Then the server giant cross crossover All right olryeotjyo in this way then 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.760
 Turn around, North Korea. 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.500
 U 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.500
 I can not sleep . 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.280
 U 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.280
 I will 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.730
 again 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.519
 Four turns, spinning like that, and then it's good to reverse the direction of the function . 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.170
 That was it. 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.260
 Now that's what you mean in this way do so even go up 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.129
 Let's play this like this 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 This is the first time I've been to this place . 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.750
 It's not like that, but when you turn softly, 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:30.000
 Instead of being able to switch the direction of the scratched car so I'll turn around like this 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.810
 The defenders will be well informed to refrain when cells then lead to've seen opponents 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.810
 To be dedicated to 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.630
 Like this 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:45.790
 In this way, I'll highlight it again. 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:50.740
 For dribbles to be successful, the jump must be based . 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 I do not want to be short. 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.380
 It's literally just playing well wherever you are. 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.560
 If the defenders step back to stop my dribble 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.740
 Give me a strong jump . 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.740
 I should think so. 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.000
 Let's do this again and again. 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.980
 I feel the dribble is glued Ly 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.570
 If the defense is not backed up, I will block the west side I do not know 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.570
 So it just opens. 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:31.639
 Re- emphasize the basics during the basics again 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:37.110
 Just go inside when you get the defense. 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:43.310
 If you do not go to the ground and then defend 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:47.210
 Hugh beat the LA Now do this should be based on the party now has the difficult conditions Rabbit 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.380
 This does not even fully adhered fully to neither ying colors 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.040
 It keeps the right distance. 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.810
 A good defender is ready even if he is. 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:03.980
 cpu similarly breathtaking predicate Excellent noticed 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.980
 How bad it is to maintain a reasonable distance 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.970
 Now you just have to push it in this state. 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.639
 But here is where would this place is hard to enter that this is blocked 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.639
 The next time I'm in Hughes, the hands-up is blocked . 

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:27.969
 So make the size I want 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:27.969
 That's the size up and seeing him in this series of dribbles .
