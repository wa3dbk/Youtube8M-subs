00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
make automated systems easier to use

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.490 
make automated systems easier to use

not a hindrance we are working to remove

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.910 
not a hindrance we are working to remove
the<00:02:33.209> ingress<00:02:33.660> caused<00:02:33.959> by<00:02:34.170> technological

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the ingress caused by technological

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.310 
the ingress caused by technological
barriers<00:02:36.230> an<00:02:38.209> interface<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.480> basically<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
barriers an interface is basically the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.620 
barriers an interface is basically the
result<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.980> three<00:02:41.340> things<00:02:41.580> which<00:02:42.330> work

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
result of three things which work

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.470 
result of three things which work
together<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.830> input<00:02:44.310> device<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:45.000> could<00:02:45.300> be

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
together the input device it could be

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.199 
together the input device it could be
the<00:02:45.660> keyboard<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.350> mouse<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:47.070> example<00:02:47.580> the

the keyboard or mouse for example the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.500 
the keyboard or mouse for example the
technique<00:02:48.810> used<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.620> interaction<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
technique used for interaction so this

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.509 
technique used for interaction so this
could<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.870> typing<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.860> keyboard<00:02:53.070> or

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
could be typing on the keyboard or

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.670 
could be typing on the keyboard or
moving<00:02:53.940> an<00:02:54.060> icon<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.840> mouse<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.470> the

test these three aspects are

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.500 
test these three aspects are
interdependent<00:02:58.489> during<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> days<00:02:59.850> when<00:03:00.330> the

now take another leap forward in the

now take another leap forward in the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
interaction we will be able not only to

allow people to carry out far more
complex<00:03:35.340> operations<00:03:36.060> but<00:03:36.390> also<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:37.019> make<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
complex operations but also to make the
