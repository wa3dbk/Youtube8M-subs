00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 Spy items and gifts at a good price 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.619
 today we present the latest model of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.199
 die cutting machines 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.620
 mobile phone sim cards this 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.949
 model is called dual has the great 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.850
 advantage that you have incorporated two 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.290
 Die two slots for the two types 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.620
 cards that are now more 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.430
 used this slot a little bit more 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.350
 great is for microsim cards that 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.159
 are those that use mobile phones 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.370
 like the iphone 4 or the samsung galaxy and 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.520
 a smaller slot to convert the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 micro sim in a nano without wool not without a 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.790
 it's the smallest card there is now 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.030
 same as is the one used by 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:18.330
 phones like the iphone 5 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 its use is very simple yes 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.820
 we have a card size without normal the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.740
 we introduce with the cut corner 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.570
 superior on the right side just as 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.390
 we see in the die the upper corner 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.970
 right cut is to say that we are 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.180
 seeing the metal part we insert it 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.180
 until the bottom we tighten strongly 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:49.890
 and here we have what is left 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 the part let's say empty and on the other hand 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.740
 we have the card cut to size 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.260
 micro sim for an iphone 4 for example 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.140
 that we would like it to be for an iphone 5 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.030
 and we want to cut it to size nano 5g mos 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 the micro sim that we just cut 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.510
 we introduce it in the small format of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.030
 Naro without in here to the bottom well 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.790
 introduced to the bottom and the same 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.910
 operation we do so let's put mouth 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.910
 down 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.900
 and here we already have a hand without it being the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.379
 Smallest size for an iphone 5 by 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.379
 example 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.160
 as you can see its use is very simple very 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.690
 fast we cut the card without sin 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.120
 danger of getting lost 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.370
 cutting it with a pair of scissors we cut it 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.870
 in just 5 seconds and now we have 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.320

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.570
 sachet several adapters for yes 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.970
 then we want to convert the card 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.730
 nano 5 or micro sim in a sim card 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.500
 normal to be able to re-enter it 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.630
 in a normal phone that is to say it converts 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.930
 the little one again big time with these 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.930
