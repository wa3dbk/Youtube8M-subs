do not get me wrong at the end of the
day<00:01:48.070> some<00:01:48.520> people<00:01:48.850> can<00:01:49.149> actually<00:01:49.450> host<00:01:49.899> is

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
day some people can actually host is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.050 
day some people can actually host is
there<00:01:50.710> are<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:50.950> few<00:01:51.219> people<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.579> can<00:01:51.789> host

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
there are a few people that can host

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.730 
there are a few people that can host
them<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.479> they<00:01:52.840> have<00:01:53.020> evidence<00:01:53.469> that<00:01:53.619> they

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
them and they have evidence that they

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.679 
them and they have evidence that they
can<00:01:53.859> host<00:01:54.070> them<00:01:54.310> but<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.880> point<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.359> there's

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
can host them but the point is there's

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.419 
can host them but the point is there's
only<00:01:56.020> going<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.320> be<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.469> person<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.189> hosts

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.520 
only going to be one person that hosts
them<00:01:57.640> because<00:01:58.030> loads<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.450> people<00:01:58.600> don't<00:01:59.320> have

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530
