00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.639
 and with friends I'm flag every font you 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.059
 I'm going to teach you how to play iphone 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 maroon five stars or the variants that 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.109
 nothing we are going to see a capo in the fret 4 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.650
 okay 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.119
 this song is quite easy this one 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.560
 you are a beginner I think you are 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.300
 I concentrate a lot 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.809
 although it 's good for all the rola to use 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.809
 four chords the sun my youngest and king 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.010
 and the easy thing about this is that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.050
 these two fingers the four and in three they 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 they will always be in the four between 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.440
 three years ago 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.090
 and 3 on the 3rd fret of the second that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 then 24 will go on it 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.570
 this fret 7 other than 3 from the field 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 as you want to see it from the first string 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:08.360
 and finger 3 will go on the fret 7 other 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.360
 of 3 of the second string 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.460
 those 22 will drop the whole song there and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.520
 good to make our eye with the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.120
 ninth who is the king let's do the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.230
 finger one in fret six other fingers of 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.270
 the fourth string and the two finger on the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.750
 fret of seven other three in the fifth 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.750
 agreement 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.679
 and here the arpeggio in the right hand 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.500
 easy enough it's also that you remember 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.720
 quarter and rope third rope first 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.620
 rope second rope 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.640
 third rope 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.140
 again first that agrees with the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.479
 rope 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.479
 he remembers first rope is a rope 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.870
 what then action 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.950
 again 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.180
 it's the first chord after we'll see 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.460
 a greater sun but what we do these 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.380
 two fingers we put a rope 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.330
 the pea is the same only 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.330
 under is obviously on the sixth string 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.069
 we would use extra rope fourth string 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.780
 third rope first rope second 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.780
 rope third rope 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.540
 then we will make a minor also 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.670
 with a ninth 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.310
 all we do here is everything 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.340
 we leave the same and the only thing we do 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.730
 finger 2 we are going to put it in fret 6 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.210
 fret 2 from the boss of the fourth 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.700
 rope 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.060
 and the arpeggio is equal low in the sixth 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.060
 rope 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.850
 I'm going to play the same three chords 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.770
 the last chord that is the king his 4 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.240
 he is the only one who changes the art a 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.870
 little science was going to be the finger one in 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.900
 the fret seixo fret two of the fourth 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.110
 rope of the third rope forgiveness the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.010
 finger three on the fret seven other three 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.239
 of the second 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.750
 the little finger the 24 on the fret 3 of 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.629
 the first other 7 and here the finger what 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.450
 let's put back on the fret 6 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.810
 although it does not sound right now 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.000
 then what we are going to do is 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.790
 the arpeggio will start at the on the bass 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.300
 in the fourth the fourth string is going to 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.760
 make second string second string 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.680
 first string there we're going to remove the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.670
 small finger and we're going to put it back 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.670
 Well, it's going to be like that 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.710
 believers fourth rope third rope 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.450
 second string 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.650
 of the rope 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.449
 we remove a small one and we are going to put it 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.449
 all the laps are like this 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.669
 i 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.050
 Y 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.060
 and good so it goes throughout the whole song 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.310
 the song is equal to this record verse 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.889
 of cut if they are touching you are 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.380
 if you want they can scratch in the choir 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.440
 Y 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.440
 and 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.630
 but I say there is how you see in the 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.800
 original song all the time the 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.800
 guitar goes with the art I 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.770
 if you put practically the whole song 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.020
 I do not leave the table below here 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.319
 anything if it 's an occasion 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.599
 pretty simple but again I repeat 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.449
 if you are a beginner, it will help you in 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.180
 regarding the change of chords and as soon as 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.569
 to the region and well then that's it 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.199
