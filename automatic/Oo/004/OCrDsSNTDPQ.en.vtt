00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
what it's like we'll add a chapter and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
what it's like we'll add a chapter and
then<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.329> you'll<00:01:30.479> enter<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.869> chapter

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
then up here you'll enter the chapter

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.660 
then up here you'll enter the chapter
title<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> what's<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.490> in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
title so this is what's going to be in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
title so this is what's going to be in
bold<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> we'll<00:01:33.840> say<00:01:34.670> sample<00:01:35.990> chapter<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
bold and we'll say sample chapter and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
bold and we'll say sample chapter and
then<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> come<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.060> basically

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
then you come in here and it's basically

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.499 
then you come in here and it's basically
all<00:01:39.689> set<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:39.990> very<00:01:40.350> similar<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.549> word<00:01:42.180> in

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
all set out very similar to word in

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.260 
all set out very similar to word in
terms<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.829> processing<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.909> very

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
terms of the processing so it's very

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
terms of the processing so it's very
powerful<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> program<00:01:47.070> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
powerful and this is a program I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.160 
powerful and this is a program I
recommend<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.729> people<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:49.049> have

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
recommend for people that don't have

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.460 
recommend for people that don't have
word<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.340> currently<00:01:50.700> using<00:01:50.790> word<00:01:51.470> then

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
word if you're currently using word then

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
word if you're currently using word then
you<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> redundant<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.049> ahead

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you it's kind of redundant to go ahead

Kindle<00:02:22.160> kind<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> all<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.730> one<00:02:22.880> package<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.050> I'm

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
Kindle kind of all in one package so I'm

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.180 
Kindle kind of all in one package so I'm
gonna<00:02:24.350> go<00:02:24.560> ahead<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.920> say<00:02:25.850> sample<00:02:26.240> text<00:02:27.190> click

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
gonna go ahead and say sample text click

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.430 
gonna go ahead and say sample text click
here<00:02:28.760> let's<00:02:29.180> go<00:02:29.360> ahead<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.260> make

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
here let's go ahead you can make

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.790 
here let's go ahead you can make
anything<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:31.010> hyperlink<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.990> right<00:02:33.230> click<00:02:33.560> or

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
conversion from here to there so it's

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.550
