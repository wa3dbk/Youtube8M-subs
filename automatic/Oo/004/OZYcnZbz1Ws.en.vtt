00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.020
 welcome to the kitchen version the day 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.890
 today we are going to make this delicious 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.890
 coconut lemonade 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.200
 to prepare this coconut lemonade the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.930
 ingredients are a milk can of 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.970
 coconut brand best choice 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:36.200
 sumo of 4 lemons ice quantity 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:39.380
 necessary sugar to taste 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.700
 mint leaves to decorate what 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.880
 first thing we should do is organize 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.920
 the lemons to get juice remember 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.460
 that the lemon should not be cut in half 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.410
 but in helmets like this we go 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.060
 removing 1 2 and 3 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.130
 this part that is here is the heart 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.840
 of lemon this is not used because it is more 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.850
 bitter at the time of squeezing it 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.760
 that usually recipes tend to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.760
 be more bitter because they used a 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.370
 part of the heart we are going to make the juice 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.740
 let's take it out and always squeeze it 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.140
 in excess to not get the taste either 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.800
 acid from the shell then this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.660
 form we squeeze in this case a lemon and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.910
 we're also going to do it with three others 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.610
 lemons more to have the amount ready 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.410
 for our recipe 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 to make the lemonade we are going to put 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.340
 all the ingredients within our 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.300
 blender we are going to put the juice of the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.670
 four lemons 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.280
 all the content of this coconut milk 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.490
 brand best choice is a sauce is a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 very creamy coconut milk because we 're going 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 to put everything 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.049
 let's also put sugar to taste 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.820
 and the rest of the space we are going to be 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.820
 filled with ice 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.290

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.959
