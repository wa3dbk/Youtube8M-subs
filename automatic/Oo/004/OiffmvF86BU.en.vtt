here<00:00:07.920> in<00:00:08.920> this<00:00:09.100> folder<00:00:09.610> I<00:00:09.790> have<00:00:10.210> all<00:00:10.600> of<00:00:10.660> my

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
here in this folder I have all of my

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.950 
here in this folder I have all of my
rigs<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:12.610> each<00:00:12.850> float<00:00:13.210> that<00:00:13.420> I<00:00:13.480> have<00:00:13.660> is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
rigs and on each float that I have is

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.289 
rigs and on each float that I have is
the<00:00:14.170> shot<00:00:14.410> in<00:00:14.620> pattern<00:00:15.070> where<00:00:15.790> I<00:00:15.820> have<00:00:16.119> the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
the shot in pattern where I have the

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.600 
the shot in pattern where I have the
shot<00:00:16.570> and<00:00:16.869> importantly<00:00:17.590> just<00:00:18.040> importantly

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
shot and importantly just importantly

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.439 
shot and importantly just importantly
what<00:00:19.210> size<00:00:19.540> of<00:00:19.779> shot<00:00:20.020> so<00:00:20.650> this<00:00:20.950> float<00:00:21.250> here<00:00:21.670> is

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
what size of shot so this float here is

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.140 
what size of shot so this float here is
an<00:00:22.750> in<00:00:23.190> 23.6<00:00:24.190> so<00:00:24.760> by<00:00:24.910> looking<00:00:25.119> here<00:00:25.660> in<00:00:26.880> 23.6<00:00:27.880> it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
an in 23.6 so by looking here in 23.6 it

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.300 
an in 23.6 so by looking here in 23.6 it
says<00:00:28.330> one<00:00:28.539> number<00:00:28.840> eight<00:00:29.020> seven<00:00:29.440> inches<00:00:29.770> one

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
says one number eight seven inches one

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.549 
says one number eight seven inches one
number<00:00:30.580> eight<00:00:30.730> 14<00:00:31.270> inches<00:00:31.690> and<00:00:31.869> seven<00:00:32.410> to

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
number eight 14 inches and seven to

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.080 
number eight 14 inches and seven to
eight<00:00:32.710> number<00:00:33.070> eight<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.430> twenty<00:00:33.790> one<00:00:33.820> inches

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
eight number eight to twenty one inches

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.600 
eight number eight to twenty one inches
so<00:00:34.930> now<00:00:35.110> we<00:00:35.170> go<00:00:35.530> about<00:00:35.769> putting<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.190> shot<00:00:36.400> on

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
so now we go about putting the shot on

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.040 
so now we go about putting the shot on
the<00:00:36.820> line<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:38.140> by<00:00:38.350> putting<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.820> loop<00:00:40.059> back<00:00:40.840> in

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
the line so by putting the loop back in

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.310 
the line so by putting the loop back in
the<00:00:41.170> loop<00:00:41.350> tire<00:00:41.680> again<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.870> my<00:00:44.079> first

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
the loop tire again because my first

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.130 
the loop tire again because my first
shot<00:00:44.680> is<00:00:44.860> at<00:00:45.070> seven<00:00:45.399> inches<00:00:45.730> if<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:46.329> put<00:00:46.630> my<00:00:46.899> loop

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
shot is at seven inches if I put my loop

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.450 
shot is at seven inches if I put my loop
on<00:00:47.320> there<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.559> would<00:00:47.770> not<00:00:47.920> be<00:00:48.040> able<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.190> put<00:00:48.370> that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
on there I would not be able to put that

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.580 
on there I would not be able to put that
shot<00:00:48.730> on<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.480> first<00:00:49.719> shot<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.140> always<00:00:50.410> put

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
shot on so the first shot I always put

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
shot on so the first shot I always put
on<00:00:50.739> with<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.010> loop<00:00:51.160> tire<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.739> pick<00:00:54.430> my

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
on with the loop tire so I pick my

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.750 
on with the loop tire so I pick my
number<00:00:54.879> right<00:00:54.910> shot<00:00:55.300> again<00:00:56.110> this<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.190> your

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
number right shot again this is your

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.549 
number right shot again this is your
final<00:00:58.239> check-in<00:00:58.780> period

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
final check-in period

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.459 
final check-in period
it's<00:00:59.680> your<00:00:59.980> rig<00:01:00.250> make<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.120> right<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.629> on<00:01:02.320> each

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
it's your rig make it right so on each

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.619 
it's your rig make it right so on each
shot<00:01:02.770> you<00:01:02.920> put<00:01:03.100> on<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.370> line<00:01:03.579> just<00:01:04.119> make<00:01:04.360> sure

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
shot you put on the line just make sure

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.800 
shot you put on the line just make sure
that<00:01:04.660> it's<00:01:04.989> centrally<00:01:05.649> cut<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.220> round<00:01:07.030> if<00:01:07.630> it

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
that it's centrally cut and round if it

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.440 
that it's centrally cut and round if it
doesn't<00:01:08.170> look<00:01:08.289> right<00:01:08.470> discard<00:01:09.399> it<00:01:09.610> do<00:01:09.970> not<00:01:10.000> put

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
doesn't look right discard it do not put

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.650 
doesn't look right discard it do not put
a<00:01:10.479> shot<00:01:10.720> on<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.929> line<00:01:11.080> that<00:01:11.319> you<00:01:11.410> don't<00:01:11.649> like

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
a shot on the line that you don't like

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.180 
a shot on the line that you don't like
that<00:01:13.660> is<00:01:13.869> one<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.259> most<00:01:14.440> important<00:01:14.979> things

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
that is one of the most important things

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.279 
that is one of the most important things
again<00:01:15.819> it's<00:01:16.149> not<00:01:16.300> about<00:01:16.450> having<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.990> million

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
again it's not about having a million

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.949 
again it's not about having a million
rigs<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:17.830> having<00:01:18.130> rigs<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.240> trust<00:01:19.630> and

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
rigs it's having rigs that you trust and

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.139 
rigs it's having rigs that you trust and
that<00:01:19.990> are<00:01:20.800> perfectly<00:01:21.190> charged<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:21.819> the<00:01:21.940> first

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
that are perfectly charged so the first

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.779 
that are perfectly charged so the first
one<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:23.020> nip<00:01:23.319> them<00:01:23.440> on<00:01:23.619> my<00:01:23.800> teeth<00:01:24.069> probably

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789

flow just by gently wetting the flow
remember<00:02:05.709> from<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.039> base<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.420> body<00:02:07.630> just

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
remember from the base of the body just

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.320 
remember from the base of the body just
gently<00:02:08.890> slide<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.459> up<00:02:09.550> look<00:02:09.819> how<00:02:09.910> easy<00:02:10.119> that

gently slide it up look how easy that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.240 
gently slide it up look how easy that
slides<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.170> again<00:02:11.410> you'll<00:02:11.709> notice<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.130> when

slides and again you'll notice that when

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.280 
slides and again you'll notice that when
I'm<00:02:12.370> sliding<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.450> piece<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.780> line<00:02:14.110> is

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
I'm sliding it this piece of line is

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.619 
I'm sliding it this piece of line is
slack<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.099> line<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.579> not<00:02:15.790> cutting<00:02:16.120> into<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
slack the line is not cutting into the

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.929 
slack the line is not cutting into the
body<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.989> flow<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.980> just<00:02:18.189> by<00:02:18.310> sliding<00:02:18.640> it

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
body of the flow so just by sliding it

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.610 
body of the flow so just by sliding it
up

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
up

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.910 
up
rubbers<00:02:20.400> come<00:02:20.550> off<00:02:20.959> which<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.140> not<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.319> bad

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
rubbers come off which is not a bad

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.570 
rubbers come off which is not a bad
thing

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.949 

takes<00:02:26.580> two<00:02:26.790> seconds<00:02:27.239> just<00:02:27.480> pop<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.780> back<00:02:27.810> on

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
takes two seconds just pop it back on

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.949 
takes two seconds just pop it back on
again<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.280> next<00:02:29.819> shot<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.599> remember

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
again so now the next shot if I remember

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.860 
again so now the next shot if I remember
rightly<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.709> at<00:02:31.830> 14<00:02:32.310> inches<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:33.209> me<00:02:33.630> board

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
rightly it's at 14 inches of me board

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.660 
rightly it's at 14 inches of me board
that's<00:02:34.440> why<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.620> always<00:02:34.739> use<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.220> board<00:02:35.459> it's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
that's why I always use this board it's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.170 
that's why I always use this board it's
brilliant

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
brilliant

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.809 
brilliant
every<00:02:36.510> week's<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> same<00:02:37.080> every<00:02:37.560> time

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
every week's the same every time

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.850 
every week's the same every time
brilliant<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.300> all<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.080> by<00:02:40.380> holding

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
brilliant so all I do is just by holding

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.699 
brilliant so all I do is just by holding
the<00:02:41.220> line<00:02:41.400> again<00:02:42.030> making<00:02:42.870> sure<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> shot

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
the line again making sure that the shot

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.600 
the line again making sure that the shot
is<00:02:43.980> centrally<00:02:44.970> cut<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.739> again<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.250> doesn't

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
is centrally cut and again if it doesn't

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.370 
is centrally cut and again if it doesn't
look<00:02:47.730> right<00:02:47.940> throw<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.540> away

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.009 

so<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.560> by<00:02:52.680> nipping<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.489> line<00:02:54.019> it's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
so just by nipping that on the line it's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.370 
so just by nipping that on the line it's
slightly<00:02:55.470> shorter<00:02:56.160> than<00:02:56.190> 14<00:02:57.090> inches<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:58.200> all<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
slightly shorter than 14 inches so all I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.240 
slightly shorter than 14 inches so all I
do<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.890> just<00:02:59.310> push<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.819> gently<00:03:00.830> 14<00:03:01.830> inches

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
do is just push it gently 14 inches

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.729 
do is just push it gently 14 inches
moving<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> bulk<00:03:03.630> now<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.410> remember

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
moving on to the bulk now if I remember

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.580 
moving on to the bulk now if I remember
rightly<00:03:04.950> it's<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.670> point<00:03:05.910> 6<00:03:06.299> into<00:03:06.720> 3<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.440> that

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
rightly it's a point 6 into 3 and that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.789 
rightly it's a point 6 into 3 and that
means<00:03:07.799> 7<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> 8<00:03:08.519> number<00:03:08.819> 8<00:03:08.849> or<00:03:09.269> 21<00:03:09.840> inches<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
means 7 to 8 number 8 or 21 inches so

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.410 
means 7 to 8 number 8 or 21 inches so
the<00:03:10.950> third<00:03:11.130> thing<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.549> do<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:12.030> get<00:03:12.209> another

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the third thing to do is get another

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.339 
the third thing to do is get another
number<00:03:12.780> 8<00:03:14.060> again<00:03:15.060> making<00:03:15.450> sure<00:03:15.599> it's<00:03:16.019> cut

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
number 8 again making sure it's cut

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.589 
number 8 again making sure it's cut
perfectly<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.400> putting<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.120> line

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
perfectly and putting it on the line

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.360 
perfectly and putting it on the line
the<00:03:18.750> 21<00:03:19.290> inches<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:23.120> just<00:03:24.120> nip<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.630> line

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
the 21 inches so just nip it on the line

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.039 
the 21 inches so just nip it on the line
slightly<00:03:26.370> shorter<00:03:26.790> than<00:03:26.820> 21<00:03:27.269> inches<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.560 
slightly shorter than 21 inches and the
nice<00:03:28.230> thing<00:03:28.470> about<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:28.890> soft<00:03:29.190> shot<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:30.060> just
