all<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.199> week<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:02.370> scrapping<00:00:06.440> a

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
all right this week we're scrapping a

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:31.570 
all right this week we're scrapping a
computer<00:00:08.910> power<00:00:09.120> source

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.170 

check<00:00:32.580> it<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.809> from<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> computer<00:00:34.910> it's<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
check it out it's from a computer it's a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.250 
check it out it's from a computer it's a
power<00:00:36.420> source<00:00:36.900> you<00:00:38.750> know<00:00:39.750> what's<00:00:39.900> in<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.080> power

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
power source you know what's in a power

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.979 
power source you know what's in a power
supply<00:00:40.760> then<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> power<00:00:42.030> source<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.720> got<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
supply then a power source so that got a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
supply then a power source so that got a
little<00:00:43.170> power<00:00:43.290> source<00:00:43.650> I<00:00:43.949> meant<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> say<00:00:44.970> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
little power source I meant to say it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.759 
little power source I meant to say it's
a<00:00:45.750> power<00:00:45.930> supply<00:00:47.960> this<00:00:48.960> stuff<00:00:49.260> doesn't<00:00:49.470> take

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
a power supply this stuff doesn't take

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.130 
a power supply this stuff doesn't take
long<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> partner<00:00:50.820> work<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.269> it's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
long to take a partner work for it's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
long to take a partner work for it's
always<00:00:52.350> worth<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:52.890> taking<00:00:53.510> taking

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
always worth your time taking taking

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.979 
always worth your time taking taking
this<00:00:54.780> stuff<00:00:54.989> apart<00:01:02.090> maybe<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this stuff apart maybe it's not if you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.600 
this stuff apart maybe it's not if you
make<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> hundred<00:01:04.440> dollars<00:01:04.770> an<00:01:04.920> hour<00:01:05.039> it's<00:01:05.399> not

make a hundred dollars an hour it's not

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.100 
make a hundred dollars an hour it's not
worth<00:01:05.789> your<00:01:05.940> time<00:01:06.119> taking<00:01:06.509> this<00:01:06.600> stuff<00:01:06.780> apart
