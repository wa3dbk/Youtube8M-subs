okay flashing paddles are more efficient

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.510 
okay flashing paddles are more efficient
and<00:01:55.780> better<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.259> faster<00:01:56.439> etc<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.220> there<00:01:57.400> is

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
and better and faster etc but there is

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.590 
and better and faster etc but there is
something<00:01:58.030> really<00:01:58.450> still<00:01:58.960> delightful<00:01:59.770> about
