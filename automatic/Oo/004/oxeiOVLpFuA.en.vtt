00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 well well well very well evenings 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.359
 quiet let's say between parties with two 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.000
 degrees this evening juve genoa then kgb ha 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.889
 the slope then tempered by a little down 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 in the end the referee didn't climb 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.280
 the tights are clearly seen 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 that in short the legs were chilly 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.090
 so he didn't feel like running 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.350
 well it says it would take 8 minutes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.619
 recovery we are three so there 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 let's get up and then 30 seconds from the end 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 the split ends of gb they should 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.900
 still talk about football and ne 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.700
 they will speak again this time though if I do 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.350
 allow this time they must appear 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 starting talking is really successful e 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.690
 there were four successful situations 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.720
 remember in this match 1 for juve 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.880
 I think we say that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.380
 there are two very strict penalties between juve 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.510
 and those like viruses there is no rigor 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.660
 sure precise trusted name for i 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.370
 stakes parity then there is a rigor on which one 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.960
 discusses so much but I believe that beyond 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.420
 any discussion 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.360
 don't give a penalty like that 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 be pretty blatant because it says 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.869
 speech he touched with his true foot 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.250
 found hit but it's not a rebound a 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.640
 shooting rebounded by an intervention 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.320
 defensive and fat a cross and at that 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.869
 point if on a ball so entitles with the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.590
 go wide arms get in trouble from 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.869
 only and sincerely it is clear that the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.470
 voluntary but it is a broken-down intervention 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.490
 that prevents the end of year ball there 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.380
 but let us take it to another delegation 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.909
 because what's happening in the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 building we are still in the press room e 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.190
 the midnight pasta and that will have some 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.069
 unbelievable aftermath obviously is not 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.479
 or it is not rigor on which they have precisely this 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.830
 destroyed life but I know but I am 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.240
 marked two notes of the indications 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.159
 this summer's ability to hear them 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.020
 it can be rigor but we do 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.330
 pretend that is not the problem here with 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.979
 you say that the nara referee says that 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.509
 penalty the chief referee says not me 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.490
 I heard it and we can clearly see it 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.380
 because you watch the player protests 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.719
 help and go straight to the middle 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 then they rejoice because they are not less than being 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.159
 dangerous and then we see that the genoa 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.990
 that goes a bit tesserate and then results 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.060
 and there is no result but turns to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.130
 drive and see that they drive a kick 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.459
 corner and then there are count here 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.910
 the referee is that as he said marotta in 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.520
 then I have to say a very very tone 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.480
 I can't even define it because of one 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.500
 who was just born to the relationship a 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.980
 take it in the field of too nervous 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.470
 fear yes 3 no it was very ironic e 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.660
 even a little mischievous, not even a little 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 mischievous stressed that the dress of 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.570
 I return to both from near Naples and la 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.450
 Juve is playing the Scudetto with Naples 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.330
 and who whistles a penalty at the 93rd giving 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.590
 two points to the juve maybe in short a 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.300
 so that the concept returns 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.840
 of juve 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.730
 actually aim correctly at solar 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.530
 you can also for the party but if 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.760
 the dress of a door that is two meters away 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.100
 Some say that admissions and everything is not 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.510
 only mail to be processed is there if 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.770
 the dress I didn't feel like that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 says that even for which the rigor but not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.150
 he wants to give it here, sorry if it comes 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.620
 confirmed then is what I then the only one 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.900
 what will never be confirmed because he 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.040
 the median tomorrow but loving of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.860
 arbitrate 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.630
 but beyond this it is very serious that it is 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.820
 true that those who have to decide whether to skin them 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.150
 undergoing it can listen to a known non 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.069
 listen tell her don't give a damn 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.840
 go away one thing, though 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.120
 sensational that has seen the whole stadium e 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.129
 that he can't have seen that in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.040
 moment in which he decides not to follow 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.200
 those indications 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.200
 the waitress asks why 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.060
 because it cannot be that you referee who 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.739
 you're second action you're running 6 May 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.989
 he held better see in that one 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.590
 situation of the goal judge he was 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.390
 there in front 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.550
 if the 2 meters and is only looking 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.269
 that scene the limits but simply 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.769
 because you feel another because to which 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.239
 we must look for the answer to this 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.590
 evening but maybe more complicated more 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.610
 simple arbitration board of coffin so 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.880
 I tell you 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.280
 and how it is that the slow juve part becomes 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.940
 a diesel produces those ten fifteen 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 goal balls 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 he takes a post and misses as usual 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.950
 achievements can take goals 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.780
 of the draw by the team that 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.000
 even finished the last half hour in 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.920
 of them were so convinced that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 what we have created so much puts them 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.450
 in function of lippi but in the recovery if 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.340
 I have to find someone who is me in 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.550
 the stake starts on punishment 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.930
 all these balls, in short, from those 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.190
 20 25 there were but also 30 certainly 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.470
 because the arbitration has diverted you from 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.150
 later on to then give these from 21 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.240
 he played very well but he must not 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.130
 however, it still has 50 times 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.110
 something especially even you have time is 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.850
 rotted in front of the vidal goalkeeper from 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.039
 brand would bring niederaurer was 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.680
 the absence of it for once if so 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.900
 it pulls so glaringly because team 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.160
 closed a little less Saturday is as it can not 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.139
 Cuban even if the woman for the beautiful 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.110
 ball yes but there were spaces so much 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.650
 clogged with sticky minds than in one 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.410
 match like this 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.880
 the area man served the man will give more 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.940
 of area that to the juve was sick because 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.340
 confirmations are sent and he is there 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.110
 looking objectively very bad 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.300
 Quailrella part of goals did a lot 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.250
 little I win was very good at 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.430
 very unlucky position 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.840
 otherwise I didn't like it and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.810
 beltrame has made that relationship is 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.820
 came in where he started 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.840
 there are conflicting judgments on the cells 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.580
 who said between a beautiful match 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.090
 which says that instead the ballet really 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.610
 and above all it is not the fifth sixth goal 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.680
 seasonally the customer decisively 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.330
 in the action of the opponents goal for that 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.570
 moriello is good jokes has been made 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.870
 mock model made a thing though them 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.370
 de celie become on which out of area with 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.760
 a harder intervention and taken away the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.470
 ball 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.120
 and in any case it must not fall on that 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.669
 pretend like this must turn around 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.160
 in short, 42 errors in the sensation is not 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.810
 unfortunately my time is healthier 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.680
 someone 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.660
 I have to greet life for once 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.090
 however, he sees being because why anyway 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.770
 you create these discussions you give from 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.280
 work but you work beautifully 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.139
 velino ties quiet perhaps travertine 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.790
 however neither name nor choose rush there is so much 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.930
 stuff he writes tonight is actually not 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.820
 had to vote we did work 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.790
 so much tonight would have been better 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.590
 instead being in the car yes yes that 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.720
 had avoided, however, let's say hello 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.060
 great guide maybe we can rates at a 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.419
 a little injured and above all a 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.850
 a little 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.350
 I make a prediction on how since 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.700
 he is not yet international you are 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.140
 these four months to become one 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.330
 you'll see that in June international 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.010
 I think in my opinion that second put 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.229
 we do not talk to these companies anelka no 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.510
 no no but used to understand that ce 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.919
 there is enough room today with here 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.030
 because we face next time 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:48.030
 for me the league and the salam able to the room 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.030
 bag
