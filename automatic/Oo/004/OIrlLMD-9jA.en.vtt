his<00:00:35.640> music<00:00:36.030> does<00:00:36.210> something<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.079> very

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
his music does something to me it's very

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.900 
his music does something to me it's very
immediate<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.950> speaks<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
immediate it speaks to me here like a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
immediate it speaks to me here like a
very<00:00:39.239> very<00:00:39.600> direct<00:00:40.530> level<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.640> think<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
very very direct level and I think it's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.330 
very very direct level and I think it's
very<00:00:42.210> imaginative<00:00:42.800> there's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
very imaginative there's a lot of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.010 
very imaginative there's a lot of
layering<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.969> old<00:00:45.180> stuff<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.960> he

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
layering of old stuff like how he

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.740 
layering of old stuff like how he
recycles<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.280> ideas<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.210> think<00:00:48.510> we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
recycles all these ideas I think we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
recycles all these ideas I think we
would<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.200> able<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.590> come<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.390> some

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
would be able to come up with some

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
would be able to come up with some
really<00:00:51.570> cool<00:00:52.039> combinations<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.520> want<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
really cool combinations you want a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.420 
really cool combinations you want a
different<00:00:54.210> answer<00:00:55.039> Frankenstein<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
different answer Frankenstein that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
different answer Frankenstein that
better

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:14.840 

I<00:01:11.750> almost<00:01:12.750> barely<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.950> concert<00:01:14.310> like

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I almost barely go to a concert like

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
I almost barely go to a concert like
regular<00:01:15.540> traditional<00:01:15.660> chorus<00:01:16.260> concerts

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
regular traditional chorus concerts

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
regular traditional chorus concerts
anymore<00:01:16.950> unless<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.940> feel<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.300> going<00:01:18.660> to<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
anymore unless I feel like going to the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.280 
anymore unless I feel like going to the
museum<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.940> go<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.600> museum

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
museum right so I want to go to a museum

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.830 
museum right so I want to go to a museum
and<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:23.160> you<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> Beethoven<00:01:24.450> piece<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and see you know a Beethoven piece I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
and see you know a Beethoven piece I
think<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.979> stage<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> people<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
think if there is a stage and people are

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.180 
think if there is a stage and people are
on<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.870> need<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.260> be<00:01:28.380> seen<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.040> they

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
on it they need to be seen that they

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.920 
on it they need to be seen that they
need<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.640> aware<00:01:29.910> of<00:01:30.300> what<00:01:30.600> they're<00:01:30.750> doing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
need to be aware of what they're doing

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.140 
need to be aware of what they're doing
and<00:01:31.260> they<00:01:31.380> need<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.800> doing<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.640> think

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and they need to be doing more I think

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
and they need to be doing more I think
all<00:01:34.850> artists<00:01:35.850> should<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.830> given<00:01:37.830> some

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
all artists should be given some

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
all artists should be given some
training<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.880> other<00:01:39.330> art<00:01:39.600> disciplines<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
training in other art disciplines I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.249 
training in other art disciplines I
think<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.250> narrow<00:01:41.580> minding<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
think it's very narrow minding to just

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
think it's very narrow minding to just
stick<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.770> thing<00:01:49.160> people<00:01:50.160> have<00:01:50.490> their

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
stick with one thing people have their

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510 
stick with one thing people have their
own<00:01:51.030> approach<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.770> how<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.979> judge<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
own approach to how they judge and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.820 
own approach to how they judge and
critique<00:01:54.030> other<00:01:54.360> people's<00:01:54.960> art<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.649> don't

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
critique other people's art I don't

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.400 
critique other people's art I don't
think<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.250> uniform<00:01:57.030> they're<00:01:57.660> standardized

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
think it's uniform they're standardized

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.070 
think it's uniform they're standardized
I<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.729> general<00:01:59.970> it's<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
I think in general it's it's really the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.889 
I think in general it's it's really the
honesty<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:02.940> an<00:02:03.210> artist<00:02:03.360> gives

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
honesty with which an artist gives

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.760 
honesty with which an artist gives
themselves<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> audience<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.869> just

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
themselves to the audience and that just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:22.280 
themselves to the audience and that just
it<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.640> works<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:21.300> entirely<00:02:21.690> about<00:02:22.050> my

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it just works it's entirely about my

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.559 
it just works it's entirely about my
experiences<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.520> emotions<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.209> my<00:02:24.360> life

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
experiences and my emotions in my life

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.190 
experiences and my emotions in my life
music<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.130> abstract<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.900> want<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
music is very abstract and if I want to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.780 
music is very abstract and if I want to
say<00:02:28.350> my<00:02:28.890> father<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> dad

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
say my father is dad

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.400 
say my father is dad
and<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.600> want<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.840> say<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.110> through<00:02:31.260> music

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
and if I want to say it through music

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800 
and if I want to say it through music
who<00:02:32.250> knows<00:02:32.550> what<00:02:32.910> people<00:02:33.060> will<00:02:33.330> get<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.660> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
who knows what people will get from it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.800 
who knows what people will get from it
if<00:02:34.050> I'm<00:02:35.150> composing<00:02:36.150> something<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
if I'm composing something with a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.780 
if I'm composing something with a
certain<00:02:37.140> emotion<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.590> mind<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.069> lot<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.610> other

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
certain emotion in mind a lot of other

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.660 
certain emotion in mind a lot of other
emotions<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.990> creep<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.010> process<00:02:41.190> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
emotions can creep in in the process and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.080 
emotions can creep in in the process and
then<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.860> mix<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.040> up<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.430> big<00:02:44.610> bowl<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
then I mix it up in a big bowl and I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.699 
then I mix it up in a big bowl and I
spit<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.420> out<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.660> people<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.410> they<00:02:46.560> will

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
spit it out of people and then they will

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.650 
spit it out of people and then they will
tell<00:02:46.890> me<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.130> they've<00:02:47.280> gotten<00:02:47.490> from<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.940> you
