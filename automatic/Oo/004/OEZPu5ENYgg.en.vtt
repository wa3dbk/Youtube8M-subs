00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 19 people know and welcome to one 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.270
 another gameplay commentary and there are 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 there are some news again today 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.350
 it is increasingly about black ops 2 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 in the background a small team sees 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.730
 deathmatch from black ops 1 come in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 small team the jungle with the command 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 a very nice words but I guess 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.460
 you all already know each other and I come 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 then just to my black ops was 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.510
 I have news today 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.879
 again something from the zombie mode 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.920
 I pick a bit yes 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.090
 back in there not as up to date 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 but I'm now a thing times 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.510
 zombie mode rausgepickt because times 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 again what is what somehow last 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.129
 time was increasingly in demand and by 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.530
 So today I have a few more 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.629
 zombie mode information 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.899
 should it be loud any one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.219
 developers of 22 zombies significantly more 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 give opportunities for example now 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.000
 will be firearms and so on 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.060
 So that's what it already was 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.810
 with the macbook and so far apart 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.610
 now part to electric shock weapons 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.950
 flamethrower and all sorts of fucking 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 can you think up we had air 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.060
 for example, air pressure with one there 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.320
 in the cinema of the dead and so on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.560
 weapons should give it back, so to speak 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 elemental wind water and everything else 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.909
 that can be used there 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 also electrically what actually only in 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.060
 black ops 1 with the fall was possible 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.680
 that should be done somehow now 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 so the notes are extended 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 to be vulnerable is yes 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.140
 well known and sometimes we look 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.329
 that there still expected are further 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.009
 new animals have been announced and indeed 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.310
 there was the black ops already one 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.229
 dogs as zombies and yes the dogs are 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 yes, almost tradition in the truck play 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.670
 so I think that too 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.960
 continue to be included as a child 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 so are already in it, and anyway 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.180
 at least, but you should now too 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 somehow horses in the zombie must be on the ob 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.869
 who are now friendly with collision 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.159
 the mature can or whether the against one 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.899
 I'm not quite sure yet 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.179
 think they are with you if you have one 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.039
 in the trailer 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.359
 by black ops 2 i think more hate 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.760
 under second trailer one has in 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.200
 singleplayer last was seen on the return 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.480
 which one rode so I think so 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.579
 sometimes he may now maps the very 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.219
 are big and that you can do so 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.569
 maybe drive or take and 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.150
 so flee or so has 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.590
 somehow something like television included 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.780
 maybe even a few more animals 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 Definitely cool I think there were times 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.109
 so rumored that heavy should be so small 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.909
 dinosaur be in it 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.069
 but I think that's unlikely 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.049
 but you still hold 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.879
 something what you in this direction in 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.319
 zombie mode can imagine well 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.609
 write it in the comments 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.780
 I could still like how 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.250
 imagine general cargo 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.049
 we already had monkeys we had 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.819
 dogs we now have for horses and 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.709
 Everything so I would first 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.169
 maybe even more so nagl animals 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.669
 can anyone imagine who's really funny 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.290
 can also go right to the table 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.359
 should rodents in that's all sides 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.129
 known so far would have been determined 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.049
 times as a little gag certainly not 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.180
 bad so at first I would 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.250
 find it funny and here it comes to me 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.889
 no goals in the gameplay here I have 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.139
 you can already say that hunting has penetrated 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.000
 So they were right in there 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.979
 a little luck honest that the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.780
 were incompetent but that was good too 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.699
 this and this is already gameplay 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.019
 as good as over 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.150
 yes you can you ever as a comment 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.620
 If necessary, leave an abo and me 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.129
 I look forward to seeing you soon 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.870
 hear 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.169
 because the gameplay is but I think so 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.790
 the ennskai his films 31 and beautiful 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.790
 day until the next time look
