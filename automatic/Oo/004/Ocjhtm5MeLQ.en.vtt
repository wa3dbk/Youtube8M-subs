00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.100
 all the cells have as they are more forming adec chains arranged in 

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.399
 a certain way 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:13.039
 viruses that are not considered cells have no chromosomes but a simple 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.039
 blacksmith chain mohan p 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.650
 the bacteria do not have a defined nucleus and that's why they are called cells 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.650
 prokaryotes 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.869
 their chromosomes are distributed throughout the cytoplasm without apparent war order 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 but the cells that make up the tissues of plants and animals 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.710
 they are the uk to biotic ie they have a well-defined core in whose 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.710
 inside are the chromosomes 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.880
 all these cells that are bad that we are going to refer 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.730
 they constitute the majority of the alive beings and they are formed by three 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.220
 core items 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.360
 nucleus the cytoplasm 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.530
 and membrane 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.760
 the nucleus of these cells has a more or less spherical shape and it 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 located located approximately in the center 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.480
 the chromosomes inside contain the genetic information and 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.350
 are responsible for controlling the operation of all processes 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 cell phones 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.110
 the cytoplasm around the nucleus 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.810
 a kind of viscous liquid in which float a series of organs that 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 they fulfill certain functions within the fed 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.200
 in the outer part and a thin membrane through which the substances enter 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.689
 that serve as food for the cell and waste substances leave 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 The behavior of cells, whether they are plants or animals, is similar to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.040
 from a factory 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.090
 there is a kind of computer that controls all cell cultures its 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.260
 Since then the assimilation until the repair of the sidewalks in the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.539
 nucleus of the cell 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.259
 All the necessary data for cellular operation are found 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.370
 archived in the genetic code of chromosomes 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.040
 from here 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.040
 all cellular functions are coordinated and controlled 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.109
 as in a factory the cell received raw materials continuously to 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.379
 through the membrane 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 where everything that enters and leaves the femp is controlled 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.009
 depending on the type of nutrition you have 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.159
 the cell will need certain type of substances 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.180
 the proteins are manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.029
 with the important collaboration of some tiny organisms william to two a 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.819
 ribosome as 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.999
 the proteins are essential for the correct functioning of all the 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.999
 zetas 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.000
 proteins are used for a multitude of functions such as 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.309
 repair of the cell membrane or to produce movement 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.219
 the energy that the cell needs is produced through breathing 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.329
 and if I store the centers called mitochondria 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.870
 In addition to internal stimuli the cell also receives stimuli from the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.959
 environment 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.049
 the cell membrane works like a kind of radar that detects 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.049
 the stimuli and so the cell responds to them 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.370
 the cells 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.230
 They use different methods to attract food and for their movements 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.479
 many cells have a kind of matches of different sizes that 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.349
 they use for the movement and capture of the food around them
