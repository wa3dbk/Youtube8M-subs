the barrel there now I want you to take

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.190 
the barrel there now I want you to take
a<00:02:28.290> look<00:02:30.020> at<00:02:31.020> both<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.380> these<00:02:31.620> guns<00:02:32.990> which<00:02:33.990> one

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
a look at both of these guns which one

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.060 
a look at both of these guns which one
looks<00:02:34.440> bigger

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
looks bigger

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.970 
looks bigger
ah<00:02:35.780> you're<00:02:36.780> thinking<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.380> aren't<00:02:37.620> you

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
ah you're thinking this one aren't you

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.830 
ah you're thinking this one aren't you
the<00:02:38.490> reason<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.360> when

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the reason that is is because when

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
the reason that is is because when
Magnum<00:02:40.320> research<00:02:40.590> came<00:02:40.800> out<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.160> first

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
Magnum research came out with the first

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.980 
Magnum research came out with the first
50<00:02:41.760> 80<00:02:41.910> pistols<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:45.060> had<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.330> same<00:02:45.540> slide

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
50 80 pistols it had the same slide

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.420 
50 80 pistols it had the same slide
assembly<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.740> it<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> exact<00:02:47.400> same

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
assembly as this it was the exact same

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.330 
assembly as this it was the exact same
size<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.900> believe<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.620> sometime<00:02:50.250> in

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
size and I believe it was in sometime in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.340 
size and I believe it was in sometime in
the<00:02:50.430> late<00:02:50.580> 90s<00:02:50.640> maybe<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.690> decided<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.170> have

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
the late 90s maybe they decided to have

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.260 
the late 90s maybe they decided to have
all<00:02:52.590> their<00:02:52.830> guns<00:02:53.070> all<00:02:53.340> three<00:02:53.550> calibers<00:02:53.940> carry

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
all their guns all three calibers carry

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.230 
all their guns all three calibers carry
the<00:02:54.420> same<00:02:54.570> slide<00:02:54.959> assembly<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.030> before<00:02:57.030> that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
the same slide assembly and before that

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.090 
the same slide assembly and before that
all<00:02:57.630> their<00:02:58.050> guns<00:02:58.200> were<00:02:58.380> called<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> mark<00:02:58.890> 7

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
all their guns were called the mark 7

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.470 
all their guns were called the mark 7
series<00:02:59.490> when<00:02:59.640> they<00:02:59.760> came<00:02:59.880> out<00:02:59.940> with<00:03:00.240> all<00:03:00.270> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
series when they came out with all the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
series when they came out with all the
gun<00:03:00.630> sharing<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.050> same<00:03:01.170> slide<00:03:01.470> assembly<00:03:01.709> they

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
gun sharing the same slide assembly they

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.240 
gun sharing the same slide assembly they
called<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.480> mark<00:03:03.750> 19<00:03:03.990> series<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
called that the mark 19 series and the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.460 
called that the mark 19 series and the
difference<00:03:05.550> between<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.940> two<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.690> mark<00:03:09.690> 7

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
difference between the two is the mark 7

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.509 
difference between the two is the mark 7
series<00:03:10.950> I'll<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:12.290> look<00:03:13.290> here<00:03:13.500> I'll<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.459> a

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
calibers you can go from in my case this

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.780 
calibers you can go from in my case this
is<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.850> 44<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.720> go<00:03:45.840> from<00:03:46.019> 44<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.680> 50<00:03:46.830> by

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
is a 44 I can go from 44 to 50 by

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.290 
is a 44 I can go from 44 to 50 by
swapping<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.780> magazine<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:51.060> slide

swapping out the magazine and the slide

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.630 
swapping out the magazine and the slide
I<00:03:51.330> just<00:03:51.570> have<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.900> get<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.050> 50<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> slide<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.519> go

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
I just have to get a 50 a slide to go

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.150 
I just have to get a 50 a slide to go
from<00:03:53.850> either<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.239> those<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.780> 357<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.860> would<00:03:56.010> have

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
from either of those to 357 I would have

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.100 
from either of those to 357 I would have
to<00:03:56.310> get<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.580> magazine<00:03:56.820> slide<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.900> bolt

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
to get a magazine slide and a bolt

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.830 
to get a magazine slide and a bolt
assembly<00:03:58.320> because<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> 357<00:03:59.700> is<00:04:00.030> obviously<00:04:00.720> a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
assembly because the 357 is obviously a

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.949 
assembly because the 357 is obviously a
smaller<00:04:01.200> round<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.269> 44<00:04:03.660> Magnum<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.959> you

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
smaller round and the 44 Magnum so you

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.759 
smaller round and the 44 Magnum so you
tell<00:04:07.170> me<00:04:07.549> it's<00:04:08.549> going<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.880> look<00:04:09.000> better<00:04:09.769> the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
tell me it's going to look better the

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.810 
tell me it's going to look better the
older<00:04:11.040> Mark<00:04:11.280> 7

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
older Mark 7

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.699 
older Mark 7
the<00:04:12.600> newer<00:04:12.810> mark<00:04:13.140> 19<00:04:14.750> sexy<00:04:15.750> aren't<00:04:15.959> they

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
the newer mark 19 sexy aren't they

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.099 
the newer mark 19 sexy aren't they
they're<00:04:17.980> both<00:04:18.070> very<00:04:18.310> good<00:04:18.430> guns<00:04:18.900> very<00:04:19.900> very

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
they're both very good guns very very

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.830 
they're both very good guns very very
reliable<00:04:21.060> every<00:04:22.060> once<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.389> while<00:04:22.540> they<00:04:22.720> will

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
reliable every once in a while they will

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.810 
reliable every once in a while they will
jam<00:04:23.230> but<00:04:23.470> honestly<00:04:23.830> mostly<00:04:24.280> that's<00:04:24.430> due<00:04:24.669> to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
jam but honestly mostly that's due to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.790 
jam but honestly mostly that's due to
resting<00:04:25.750> sometimes<00:04:26.199> I'll<00:04:26.350> have<00:04:26.440> some<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.650> my
