00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
how it was so I had a better idea as we

open it up this was shipped with
Priority<00:00:45.719> Mail<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.760> arrived

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
Priority Mail so it actually arrived

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.439

three<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.649> four<00:00:49.890> days<00:00:50.070> earlier<00:00:50.910> than<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.300> was

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
three to four days earlier than I was

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.590 
three to four days earlier than I was
expecting<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> I've<00:00:52.980> always<00:00:53.160> good<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.789> dig

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
expecting so I've always good to see dig

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.490 
expecting so I've always good to see dig
into<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> first<00:00:55.649> thing<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:57.500> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
into it the first thing we see is of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.130 
into it the first thing we see is of
course<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> harness<00:00:59.370> has<00:01:00.329> everything<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
course the harness has everything you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.460 
course the harness has everything you
need<00:01:01.170> including<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.859> brackets<00:01:03.260> don't<00:01:04.260> think

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
need including the brackets don't think

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.780 
need including the brackets don't think
I'll<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> having<00:01:04.860> any<00:01:05.040> problems<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
I'll be having any problems with this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
I'll be having any problems with this
one<00:01:06.000> seems<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.420> pretty<00:01:06.659> high<00:01:06.840> quality<00:01:07.320> all

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
one seems to be pretty high quality all

the plugs seem to be there but a fuse
there<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.320> case<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.880> high<00:01:15.659> voltage<00:01:17.210> will

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
there just in case of high voltage will

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
there just in case of high voltage will
dig<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> main<00:01:19.619> part

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
dig in here and get to the main part

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.999

of<00:01:45.540> pictures<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.200> help<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> put<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.770> together

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
of pictures to help you put it together

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.450 
of pictures to help you put it together
and<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:48.689> does<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.079> some<00:01:49.320> questions<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> are

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and it does have some questions that are

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.330 
and it does have some questions that are
often<00:01:51.270> asked<00:01:51.720> about<00:01:51.780> these<00:01:52.140> kits<00:01:54.950> next<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.100> can

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
often asked about these kits next we can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.219 
often asked about these kits next we can
pull<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> these<00:01:57.979> ballasts<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
pull out one of these ballasts so the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.990 
pull out one of these ballasts so the
ballasts<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.860> seem<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:03.149> heavy<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
ballasts do seem pretty heavy so

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.219 
ballasts do seem pretty heavy so
hopefully<00:02:06.000> they're<00:02:06.210> good<00:02:06.630> quality<00:02:06.869> I'll

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
hopefully they're good quality I'll

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050 
hopefully they're good quality I'll
probably<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> video<00:02:07.950> where<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.340> dig<00:02:08.610> into<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
probably do a video where I dig into it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.180 
probably do a video where I dig into it
see<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.569> kind<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
see what kind of it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.960 
see what kind of it
they've<00:02:10.550> used<00:02:10.580> inside<00:02:11.120> as<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:13.220> mean<00:02:13.490> there<00:02:13.850> are

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
they've used inside as I mean there are

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.880 
they've used inside as I mean there are
some<00:02:14.270> companies<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.110> are<00:02:15.350> filling<00:02:15.740> them

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
some companies that are filling them

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.460 
some companies that are filling them
with<00:02:15.920> sand<00:02:16.370> or<00:02:16.700> I've<00:02:17.480> actually<00:02:17.720> seen<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:18.320> with

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
with sand or I've actually seen one with

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.980 
with sand or I've actually seen one with
rocks<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.700> make<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.240> have<00:02:20.660> that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
rocks in it just to make it have that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.710 
rocks in it just to make it have that
that<00:02:21.680> more<00:02:22.400> quality<00:02:22.910> feel<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
that more quality feel just with the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.450 
that more quality feel just with the
weight<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.560> hopefully<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> don't<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.130> any<00:02:25.370> of

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
weight so hopefully I don't have any of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.450 
weight so hopefully I don't have any of
that<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.900> does<00:02:27.140> come<00:02:27.380> with<00:02:27.410> some<00:02:27.590> screws<00:02:28.070> here

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
that it does come with some screws here

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.670 
that it does come with some screws here
I'm<00:02:28.610> presuming<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.570> mount<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.230> with<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
I'm presuming to mount it with the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.610 
I'm presuming to mount it with the
brackets<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:35.660> double-sided<00:02:36.290> tape

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
brackets and then that double-sided tape

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.980 
brackets and then that double-sided tape
I<00:02:36.770> was<00:02:36.890> talking<00:02:37.310> about<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.790> help<00:02:37.820> mount<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.870> as

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
I was talking about to help mount it as

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.100 
I was talking about to help mount it as
well<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:40.390> then<00:02:41.390> there's<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.200> ballast<00:02:42.950> itself

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
well and then there's the ballast itself

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.510 
well and then there's the ballast itself
like<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.290> said<00:02:45.530> does<00:02:45.800> seem<00:02:46.040> pretty<00:02:46.070> good

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
like I said does seem pretty good

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.300 
like I said does seem pretty good
quality<00:02:47.030> from<00:02:47.240> just<00:02:47.510> looking<00:02:47.690> at<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.190> all<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
quality from just looking at it all the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.930 
quality from just looking at it all the
connections<00:02:49.850> are<00:02:50.120> well<00:02:51.050> done<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.700> wires

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
connections are well done and the wires

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.530 
connections are well done and the wires
don't<00:02:53.360> seem<00:02:53.660> too<00:02:53.870> Jeep<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.700> that's<00:02:55.970> one<00:02:56.360> I'll

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
don't seem too Jeep so that's one I'll

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.710 
don't seem too Jeep so that's one I'll
put<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.780> off<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.080> side<00:02:58.360> same<00:02:59.360> thing<00:02:59.390> with

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
put it off to the side same thing with

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.190 
put it off to the side same thing with
the<00:02:59.870> other<00:02:59.990> half<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:02.300> ballast<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:05.660> also

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the other half the ballast and I also

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.710 
the other half the ballast and I also
have<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.690> screws<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:11.000> tape<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:14.540> does

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
have the screws and the tape it does

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.420 
have the screws and the tape it does
also<00:03:14.900> come<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:15.350> some<00:03:15.530> zip<00:03:15.709> ties<00:03:16.010> which<00:03:16.310> are

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
also come with some zip ties which are

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.130 
also come with some zip ties which are
going<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.670> be<00:03:16.760> helpful<00:03:17.209> just<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.690> mount<00:03:17.900> it

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
going to be helpful just to mount it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.610 
going to be helpful just to mount it
around<00:03:18.440> whatever<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.730> want<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.870> would<00:03:21.470> maybe

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
around whatever you want I would maybe

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.650 
around whatever you want I would maybe
use<00:03:21.739> some<00:03:21.950> better<00:03:22.370> quality<00:03:22.910> ones<00:03:23.090> these<00:03:23.360> are

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
use some better quality ones these are

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.810 
use some better quality ones these are
they're<00:03:24.560> okay<00:03:24.890> but<00:03:24.920> they're<00:03:25.340> not<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.580> biggest

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
they're okay but they're not the biggest

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.520 
they're okay but they're not the biggest
I<00:03:26.120> will<00:03:26.239> just<00:03:26.420> go<00:03:26.510> with<00:03:26.540> them<00:03:26.810> some<00:03:27.260> thicker

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
I will just go with them some thicker

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.010 
I will just go with them some thicker
zip<00:03:28.520> ties<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:28.970> that's<00:03:29.120> where<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.420> were<00:03:29.900> going

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
zip ties if that's where you were going

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.970 
zip ties if that's where you were going
to<00:03:30.080> secure<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:32.840> finally<00:03:33.380> get<00:03:33.590> into<00:03:33.709> the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
to secure it and we finally get into the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.070 
to secure it and we finally get into the
bulbs<00:03:34.310> themselves<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:38.090> they<00:03:38.390> do<00:03:38.450> have<00:03:38.570> this

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
bulbs themselves so they do have this

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.620 
bulbs themselves so they do have this
