00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 the possible death of post light sir was 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.269
 project that Disney had for toy story3 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.969
 for many years in this voice story 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.190
 it starts to malfunction and they realize 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.859
 that they no longer make voice the llÃ­ria not of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.109
 spare parts so send it up it's 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.510
 same with the intention of being able 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 fix it but in taiwan that either 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.570
 there are parts far from repairing it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.359
 they consider obsolete and then what 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 store for further destruction 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.430
 one of his friends find out about that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.190
 situation and run fast to taiwan 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.309
 to save his friend who even 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.579
 placed on a conveyor belt in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 which would be crushed and subsequently 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 cast we see because of his evil 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.449
 functioning can not save itself 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.960
 he himself has to receive the help of his 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.780
 friends who must fight before 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.750
 a malignant transformer and a transformer 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.180
 and maybe bored come too late 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.930
 to save you 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.270
 the story of I repeat is not fiction is 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.970
 the project that had sad for all 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 bull and three for several years where already 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.520
 they were even very advanced the script and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.790
 the story words behind clear pixar 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.979
 since at that time 2004 both 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.550
 companies were in a very legal litigation 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.190
 strong that culminated until disney 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.380
 he bought pixar to steve jobs and while he 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.350
 they sent to the courts for 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.850
 understands to advance and conclude a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.430
 series of movies that they had in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.240
 inkwell with pixar among them monsters 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.240
 inc 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.270
 and of course toy story 3 when disney 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.280
 bought pixar pixar then take it back 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.790
 the projects that had been commissioned 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.200
 to a company called circle 7 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.380
 subsidiary of Disney itself and 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.869
 they ended with a happy success all 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.580
 these projects a few days ago 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.800
 jim martin the man in charge of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.770
 make the first sketches of this 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.190
 movie toy story3 went up to his site was 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.980
 those illustrations that were not used 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.140
 that was the basis of this argument that you 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.390
 I just presented that although it does not sound 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.030
 evil is very far from the masterpiece 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.940
 that came to create pixar and that premiered 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.310
 in 2010 which nevertheless resumes 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.440
 several drawings and concepts of the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.140
 original story as prisoners toys 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.020
 in baskets like a jail 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.600
 face an evil toy look 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.390
 what seems an imminent death and a 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.140
 bear that at that time was called apolo 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.230
 super 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 evolved until the lapse data says that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.420
 pixar bought in 7000 400 million 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.840
 dollars alone toy story 3 raised thousand 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.150
 million dollars says puts the silver 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.239
 pixar the talent and everyone is made 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.700
 disgustingly rich now I called the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.980
 attention of this project in taiwan or 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 prefer the version that we all saw in 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.370
 the cinema I ask you all this because the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.790
 July 16 , 2017 pixar disney announced 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.390
 that would be premiering 'toy story' 4 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.720
 and they intend to make it a story of 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.970
 romance and I imagine the meeting of the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.579
 top executives of disney for their 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.269
 Very elegant curves very expensive honey 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.190
 I do not know about happiness because in 2017 they will 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.260
 further inflate your pockets 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.380
 the question for us who are going 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.600
 to the cinema it was necessary to make a whole 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.030
 history 4 especially after the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.790
 extraordinary end of the third 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.220
 delivery that I believe from my point of 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.590
 seen since nothing hurts no longer 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.890
 they should touch each other but we will see 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.710
 if pixar can present us with a great 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.690
 history as we have come you 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.350
