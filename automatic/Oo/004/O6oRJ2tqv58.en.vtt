00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.280 
is actually not necessarily on this
engine<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.400> have<00:01:47.670> mechanical

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
pump here but it was there so we will

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.240 
pump here but it was there so we will
use<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.910> switch<00:01:54.420> our<00:01:54.600> Meg's<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:58.100> give<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.160> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
use it switch our Meg's on and give it a

now I'm going to put my thumb over the
microphone<00:02:02.970> here<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.870> keep<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:04.620> getting

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800
