motive<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.480> course<00:02:25.720> our<00:02:26.230> suppose

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
motive like that of course our suppose

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.770 
motive like that of course our suppose
there<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.069> pretty<00:02:27.520> slim<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.569> will<00:02:28.660> need

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
there is a pretty slim so you will need

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.690 
there is a pretty slim so you will need
the<00:02:29.620> pathway<00:02:29.890> attachments<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.489> that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
the pathway attachments like that

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.520 
the pathway attachments like that
absolutely<00:02:30.790> earlier<00:02:31.300> right<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.290> will

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
absolutely earlier right so this will

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.440 
absolutely earlier right so this will
prevent<00:02:32.800> water<00:02:33.069> from<00:02:33.250> splashing<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:36.450> you
