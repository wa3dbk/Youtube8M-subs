00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
online co-op seems a little off I

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.810 
online co-op seems a little off I
remember<00:02:43.740> reading<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.370> reason<00:02:44.640> why<00:02:44.760> it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
remember reading that the reason why it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.490 
remember reading that the reason why it
wasn't<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.360> there<00:02:45.540> was<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> game<00:02:46.350> was

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
wasn't in there was because the game was

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
wasn't in there was because the game was
running<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.040> much<00:02:47.160> power<00:02:47.430> already<00:02:47.880> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
running on so much power already that

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
Finn look is better on this one but in

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.830 
Finn look is better on this one but in
terms<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.410> gameplay<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.950> style<00:04:09.630> there<00:04:10.630> really

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
terms of gameplay and style there really

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.900 
terms of gameplay and style there really
isn't<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.260> much<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.710> difference<00:04:11.880> though<00:04:12.880> I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
isn't that much of a difference though I

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.199

Mario games that you've played before

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.390 
Mario games that you've played before

but it has a lot of great moments to it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.510 
but it has a lot of great moments to it
especially<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.630> ones<00:04:59.810> in<00:04:59.960> multiplayer<00:05:00.260> mode

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
especially the ones in multiplayer mode

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.340 
especially the ones in multiplayer mode
hopefully<00:05:01.520> they're<00:05:01.700> good<00:05:01.880> ones<00:05:02.350> and

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
hopefully they're good ones and

hopefully they're good ones and
personally<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.010> prefer<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.910> one<00:05:05.090> over<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.390> DS

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
personally I prefer this one over the DS

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.030 
personally I prefer this one over the DS
version<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.230> thought<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.770> one<00:05:06.920> was

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
version I thought that one was

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.520 
version I thought that one was
completely<00:05:07.640> overrated<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.420> four<00:05:09.140> out<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.350> five

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
completely overrated a four out of five

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.860 
completely overrated a four out of five
a<00:05:09.920> couple<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.430> flaws<00:05:10.640> but<00:05:10.970> overall<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.600> good

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
a couple of flaws but overall a good

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.170 
a couple of flaws but overall a good
game
