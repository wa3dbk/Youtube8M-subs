there we have it now you can also click
the<00:03:24.920> resize<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.330> actually<00:03:26.360> make<00:03:26.750> it

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
the resize so you can actually make it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
the resize so you can actually make it
smaller<00:03:27.290> or<00:03:28.840> bigger<00:03:29.840> we're<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.830> go

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
smaller or bigger we're going to go

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.980 
smaller or bigger we're going to go
ahead<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.250> adjust<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.690> go<00:03:32.720> ahead

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
ahead and adjust this and you go ahead

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.840 
ahead and adjust this and you go ahead
and<00:03:33.110> just<00:03:33.260> grab<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.740> move<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.400> around<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.820> where

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
and just grab it move it around to where

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.160 
and just grab it move it around to where
you<00:03:35.060> want<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:37.640> looks<00:03:37.880> good<00:03:38.360> right

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
you want it and that looks good right

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.530 
you want it and that looks good right
just<00:03:39.530> about<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:40.040> just<00:03:40.880> make<00:03:41.060> sure<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.420> it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
just about there just make sure that it

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.180 
just about there just make sure that it
is<00:03:41.660> big<00:03:41.900> enough<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.320> fit<00:03:42.560> around<00:03:42.650> all<00:03:43.010> these

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
is big enough to fit around all these

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.920 
is big enough to fit around all these
little<00:03:43.430> squares<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.390> think<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.690> need<00:03:44.780> to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
little squares so I think we need to

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.160 
little squares so I think we need to
resize<00:03:45.380> our<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.739> just<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.010> little<00:03:46.459> bit<00:03:46.610> more<00:03:46.820> and

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
resize our is just a little bit more and

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.449 
resize our is just a little bit more and
once<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.290> have<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.560> filled<00:03:48.860> up<00:03:49.010> all<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.370> way

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
once you have it filled up all the way

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.860 
once you have it filled up all the way
around<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:50.030> could<00:03:50.150> just<00:03:50.330> go<00:03:50.450> ahead<00:03:50.570> and<00:03:50.690> add

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
around you could just go ahead and add

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.620

there along with the castro 5661 and it

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.470 
there along with the castro 5661 and it
came<00:04:29.320> out<00:04:29.530> way<00:04:29.830> better<00:04:30.070> than<00:04:30.220> expected<00:04:30.820> super

clear<00:04:31.780> really<00:04:32.560> really<00:04:32.740> nice<00:04:33.010> now<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.670> case

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
clear really really nice now the case

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.970 
clear really really nice now the case
itself<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.540> a<00:04:34.600> glossy<00:04:35.200> finish<00:04:35.230> though<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.890> it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
itself is a glossy finish though so it

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.280 
itself is a glossy finish though so it
will<00:04:36.160> attract<00:04:36.520> fingerprinting<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.300> smudging

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
will attract fingerprinting and smudging

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.900 
will attract fingerprinting and smudging
so<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.040> might<00:04:39.250> be<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.430> little<00:04:39.610> bit<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.790> a

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
so that might be a little bit of a

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.790 
so that might be a little bit of a
problem<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.360> aside<00:04:40.570> from<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.380> case<00:04:41.620> is

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
problem but aside from that the case is

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.830 
problem but aside from that the case is
a<00:04:42.190> very<00:04:42.520> solid<00:04:42.910> case<00:04:43.060> it's<00:04:43.300> made<00:04:43.450> from<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.660> nice

it<00:04:59.260> doesn't<00:04:59.560> have<00:04:59.710> any<00:04:59.890> guard<00:05:00.220> rails<00:05:00.460> like

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
it doesn't have any guard rails like

it doesn't have any guard rails like

there<00:05:02.140> like<00:05:02.350> rebel<00:05:02.710> scholar<00:05:02.920> they<00:05:03.130> have<00:05:03.250> those

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
there like rebel scholar they have those

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.140 
plastic or all white plastic all the way
through<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:08.890> there<00:05:09.070> are<00:05:09.160> no<00:05:09.250> rails<00:05:09.520> no<00:05:09.820> nothing

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.460 
through so there are no rails no nothing
like<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.300> but<00:05:10.600> then<00:05:10.720> again<00:05:10.810> there<00:05:11.050> are<00:05:11.169> no

little bar code maybe to track the image
or<00:05:28.720> something<00:05:28.990> like<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.169> but<00:05:29.740> your<00:05:29.919> way

looks really nice especially when on the

looks really nice especially when on the
iPhone

now<00:05:38.669> as<00:05:38.880> for<00:05:39.120> in<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.419> hand<00:05:39.600> feel<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:40.080> gives<00:05:40.440> you

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
now as for in the hand feel it gives you

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.070 
now as for in the hand feel it gives you
a<00:05:40.560> really<00:05:40.860> nice<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.509> surprisingly<00:05:42.509> up<00:05:42.690> grippy

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
a really nice and surprisingly up grippy

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.020 
a really nice and surprisingly up grippy
in<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.350> hand<00:05:43.530> feel<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:44.280> say<00:05:44.460> surprisingly

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
in the hand feel and I say surprisingly

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.240 
in the hand feel and I say surprisingly
because<00:05:45.360> typically<00:05:46.050> with<00:05:46.350> these<00:05:46.530> glossy<00:05:46.860> type

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
because typically with these glossy type

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.070 
because typically with these glossy type
finished<00:05:47.639> cases<00:05:48.090> there<00:05:48.690> are<00:05:48.720> a<00:05:48.780> little<00:05:48.900> bit

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
finished cases there are a little bit

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.689 
finished cases there are a little bit
slippery<00:05:49.350> at<00:05:49.590> times<00:05:49.860> but<00:05:50.070> this<00:05:50.220> plastic

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
slippery at times but this plastic

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.129 
slippery at times but this plastic
actually<00:05:51.090> feels<00:05:51.330> like<00:05:51.509> it's<00:05:51.720> sort<00:05:51.990> of<00:05:52.050> a

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
actually feels like it's sort of a

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.620 
actually feels like it's sort of a
tackiness<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.370> which<00:05:53.880> helps<00:05:54.180> provide<00:05:54.449> for

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
tackiness to it which helps provide for

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.080 
tackiness to it which helps provide for
a<00:05:54.660> little<00:05:54.810> extra<00:05:55.050> grip<00:05:55.530> onto<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:56.070> case<00:05:56.280> now

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
a little extra grip onto the case now

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.060 
a little extra grip onto the case now
the<00:05:57.150> case<00:05:57.479> itself<00:05:57.840> doesn't<00:05:58.139> add<00:05:58.350> much<00:05:58.380> bulk<00:05:58.889> to

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
the case itself doesn't add much bulk to

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.909 
the case itself doesn't add much bulk to
the<00:05:59.100> phone<00:05:59.190> it's<00:05:59.639> pretty<00:05:59.910> slim<00:06:00.270> fitting<00:06:00.660> and

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
the phone it's pretty slim fitting and

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.439 
the phone it's pretty slim fitting and
one<00:06:01.919> thing<00:06:02.160> that<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.370> very<00:06:02.550> unique<00:06:02.970> about<00:06:03.300> this

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
one thing that is very unique about this

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.840 
one thing that is very unique about this
uncommon<00:06:03.840> case<00:06:04.139> is<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.889> button<00:06:05.250> access<00:06:05.669> on

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
uncommon case is the button access on

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.029 
uncommon case is the button access on
the<00:06:05.910> volume<00:06:06.810> rocker<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.169> on<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.740> power

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
the volume rocker and on the power

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.890 
the volume rocker and on the power
button<00:06:08.340> they<00:06:09.000> actually<00:06:09.330> have<00:06:09.479> these<00:06:09.630> little

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
button they actually have these little

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.450 
button they actually have these little
tabs<00:06:10.169> that<00:06:10.440> cover<00:06:10.770> them<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.039> I<00:06:11.160> say<00:06:11.430> that

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
tabs that cover them and I say that

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.490 
tabs that cover them and I say that
because<00:06:12.060> typically<00:06:12.660> with<00:06:12.900> slider<00:06:13.229> style

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
because typically with slider style

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.100 
because typically with slider style
cases<00:06:13.949> you<00:06:14.220> only<00:06:14.340> have<00:06:14.580> cutouts<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.810> have<00:06:15.930> big

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
cases you only have cutouts you have big

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.110 
cases you only have cutouts you have big
circle<00:06:16.590> cutouts<00:06:16.889> and<00:06:17.100> with<00:06:17.789> this<00:06:17.910> one<00:06:18.090> you

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
circle cutouts and with this one you

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.460 
circle cutouts and with this one you
actually<00:06:18.270> have<00:06:18.510> these<00:06:18.630> tabs<00:06:18.930> covering<00:06:19.350> the

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
actually have these tabs covering the

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.870 
actually have these tabs covering the
volume<00:06:19.740> rocker<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.070> i<00:06:20.310> gotta<00:06:20.460> say<00:06:20.669> they

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
volume rocker and i gotta say they

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.000 
volume rocker and i gotta say they
surprisingly<00:06:21.300> work<00:06:21.720> really<00:06:22.020> well<00:06:22.169> you<00:06:22.650> get<00:06:22.979> a

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
surprisingly work really well you get a

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.920 
surprisingly work really well you get a
good<00:06:23.220> amount<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.520> feedback<00:06:23.729> from<00:06:24.150> them<00:06:24.360> now

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
good amount of feedback from them now

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.750 
good amount of feedback from them now
aside<00:06:25.169> from<00:06:25.229> that<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:26.070> do<00:06:26.190> have<00:06:26.280> your<00:06:26.310> vibrate

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
aside from that you do have your vibrate
