00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:12.120
 This video is about a new one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:44.370
 backpack on the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:49.100
 I'm researching 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.100
 a video about gone too far 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.110
 military backpacks in contrast to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.289
 normal hiking backpacks bit around 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.590
 set and am also evasion rucksack de 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.539
 come and I have one easy 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 chose me for the color 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.460
 like 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 that was the edf per 95 liters 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.990
 I saw the flight plane 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.930
 does not offer the smaller space 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.900
 wanted to be searched when i go to israel 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.540
 come and found that the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.530
 company which also manufactures director 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.530
 sold 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:34.050
 that is in this video so in 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.500
 this sense has details agile down 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.240
 on 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.760
 when he says something about the price 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.580
 It originally has 42 US dollars 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.910
 tasted down to 120 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:54.060
 US dollar does at the present 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:59.220
 dollarkurs about 87 89 euro and then 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.740
 the eu import tax will be added and that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.930
 So in my case , it was because of it 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 an article is about 50 euros 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.000
 costs and under 150 intensive shipping 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 then were still times 16 euros a couple 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.750
 crushed almost 17 euros 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.750
 that come on it are so summa 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.830
 In summary, one can say so reduced 510 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.240
 I bought it and euro 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.930
 equivalent in the quiet spot find 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.050
 then I 'll show you a short time 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.050
 So the backpack had the end of the drink 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:36.600
 system with protective cap on it 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.430
 system teeth and then bite here 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.760
 below 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:47.910
 we switch down here then, so to speak 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.360
 valve release but it pushes yes 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.890
 three liters of drinking bubbles system that 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.060
 I think quite good immediately realizes that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.300
 former climate has been developed 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.090
 which has been developed for the EDF 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.300
 then rausgekriegt and now 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.790
 need if some elite units 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.290
 buy the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.050
 yes, but I would always say 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:20.180
 clever and look at the good part of 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:28.580
 the back so it has the backpack 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.580
 outside mill here wanted pages to two 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.319
 he has that military great one says 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.530
 to 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.620
 closures so that's a lot 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.630
 thicker also military craig 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 Zips everywhere 35 liters content 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.800
 unlike my respect the me 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.630
 otherwise I always had to uni I could 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.130
 just get the one folder and 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.570
 then just slip with the laptop here 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.760
 Everything fits under 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.350
 I still have space inside 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.700
 want to turn the military 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.919
 development already here so you can 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.000
 grab it out then he has two 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.800
 fooled front 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.960
 I created it in here and then 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.900
 down here again the front pocket there 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.940
 I have mine if nothing in it 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.940
 firewood and dried wood drill 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.890
 I then but times just to get here 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:44.419
 another side pocket for small 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:49.110
 zeug then he has all these 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:53.210
 Strong hard rubber textile parts 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.500
 Keep this whole stress together 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.680
 prevent that from happening all the time 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:07.340
 somewhere money so now I 'll go to the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:07.340
 whole apparatus around so 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:19.190
 here also wanted the drinking system has 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:24.139
 a kind of rubberized textile 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.810
 moderate hose does not help it that way 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.870
 easily gets 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:34.060
 I'm really excited hip quote everything 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.889
 padded and then with great 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:42.410
 So shut that up a bit 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:44.450
 harder to walk a bit heavier 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.810
 They do not expect work in this way either 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:56.840
 Easily drinking system it has the cap 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.330
 To be honest, that has me a little bit 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.750
 difficult for the cap, the cap is 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.870
 also secured with a cord 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.600
 that you do not lose them I think 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:14.560
 the totally cool the situation between plague 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:18.850
 and here is the three-liter bubble in it 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.340
 between the bubble and the main part is 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.240
 almost behind the mole on my ipad in 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.669
 layer in it 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.160
 I am very excited about the part 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:33.220
 even more in kicking and zipper 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:38.409
 and about no idea how big 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:43.809
 the part is ingenious to arrange 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:47.469
 So bush vigorously I hope that you 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:50.529
 this answer pleases supercomm premiere 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:52.300
 that was part of my page is it 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:56.709
 Worth a recommendation for all those still 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:00.159
 So do not have a proper backpack 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:03.519
 for a three day trip depending on how 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:09.219
 Spartan is equipped 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:10.419
 I am already absolutely enough 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:12.249
 would probably even more 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.739
 weeks to endure if only one 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:17.469
 Change of clothes has also max 

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:19.539
 really under our daily stress 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:20.259
 should it use now you can here 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.449
 wonderful 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:25.449
 you see it here this cross-com 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.969
 you can make it smaller by pressing it 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:32.619
 finds the part absolutely ingenious and 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:35.259
 expandable by the mill systems still 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:37.209
 not shown and down if you do 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.159
 sometimes turn off are also again 

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:41.709
 So you can do four of these fashionable ones 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:43.509
 a sleeping mat or something very good 

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:45.909
 pack underneath or if you stop 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:49.179
 Firewood has collected you can do that 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:52.199
 here across with fast with the 

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:55.990
 belt or whatever 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:56.499
 So then I make the video to 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.689
 The End 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:02.729
 and you may be backpacking 

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:02.729
 See you more often
