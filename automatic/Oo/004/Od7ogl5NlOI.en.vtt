 Takejin Taketake Blood Orange Arms 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.929
 This is the arm change series of the Prevan limitation, and the women's association is after this postwar b battle 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:18.960
 It is an enemy character 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.620
 Personally, I use ganbarizing and it's great and strong c voice is also cool and best 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.050
 Right 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.419
 That minute 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:30.899
 in Ayumu 's ac series, so I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.899
 The top is the makeover process and this is the background 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.030
 Yes the contents are basically because it is a nested item of arm 鎧 鎧 鎧 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 Contents also Bujingai It is the same body and blood orange Arms 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.450
 It and met parts and generations of Takehito Satoshi version 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.380
 And let's see from the body the battlefield in Muso Saber 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.850
 The whole is really like he's color scheme era is always with Takeru 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.200
 It is exactly the same Takehito Takeru has a black crusher and its parts 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.470
 It is metallic red 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.480
 I'm also with the battlefield driver or the incomparable saber holster 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.750
 I do not have a lock seed holder on the other side, but I've been cleaning the belt of Takeda town 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.370
 Maekawa comparison and back comparison and weapon parts 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.570
 Orange circle and Muso Saber this is orange 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.710
 It is totally different now with the armless Saber together now 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.120
 It contains also be made in metallic green silver color scheme based in properly 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.780
 And Blood Orange Arms This is a black paint based on a red molded color 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.470
 It is done 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 It is this is a warrior none seems a little grotesque pattern Usshirou 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.490
 It is this and the Met part also compared with the lens you have wet properly 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.740
 If you try side by side, the Orange Arms will judge , so the comparison of Met looks like Blood 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.920
 Set the Met Parts to the Orange Arms 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.980
 The way is completely with Orange Arms 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.300
 part once to expand message on the back of parts 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.830
 Return to the other head in the same encourage the reverse order 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.830
 Yes this is ok then 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.189
 Strictly, innocent samurai does not reply 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.640
 I don't change arms, but I'll transform in the same way as Ikubu 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:11.349
 Set arm 2 from above as usual and lock on shoulder parts 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:17.319
 And then expand the parts First behind the shoulder parts further 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:22.569
 And if ask to have the breast Park further orange circle and Muso Saber 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:28.269
 Kansai Takehito Taketake Blood Orange Arms This is more than I thought 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:31.120
 A little Oh Ranger Mutsu because the warrior is a coin in one day I armor Takeshi I say is none 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.139
 I thought it would keep the atmosphere 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.310
 It's a very cool villain-like atmosphere 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:42.620
 There is also the weirdness of arms 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.160
 The pattern of the compound eye becomes clear red Nervously the villain's character has come out because of this face 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.849
 I suppose 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.420
 It looks like this from the cool back 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:56.700
 The image changes quite well though 4 routes should be with none 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:02.410
 The movement is exactly the same as the usual arm's change , so pose appropriately 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.650
 With the generations window to determine the Bashi' course Yoroibu same Muso Saber 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.950
 It is good to be able to be in Naginata mode 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.040
 'M Takeshi blade District 6 cool course Muso Saber 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.640
 It is also possible to attach it to the forster 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.640
 It does not become this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:23.890
 Yes, it will be like this if you line it up with こ う 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.950
 Proportion Toka armed parts also has come out quite the atmosphere of Apu role with the same 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.780
 And to do it the dumping that Tsu lime Toka cherry hurricane 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.470
 Jin bar lemon Arms of tulips poker warrior Yoroibu This is it looks almost no 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.580
 Furthermore, at the time of victory with no warriors, arms met parts are 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:45.120
 I kept the blur and the lens, but after all it's still present 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:50.040
 Or the last would not it what there is also a watermelon and personal Yoroibu these kinda cute Takeshi blade Street 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.280
 Let's return to the arms state First, attach the Met parts and the back parts and put them in the chest 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:59.450
 Return parts and parts 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.450
 And if I pulled it, I could get the initial arms after all is super easy 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.220
 bb 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.900
 By the way ac pb 01's humanoid mobble trencher imitation was introduced 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.950
 The atmosphere of Takehito Ruitake has come out amazing that the Orange Arms appearance has disappeared more than expected 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:33.450
 This is just ac tb series there was a worth waiting half a year at the moment 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.010
 Since I have made reservations for 04, I hope that the future acp b series will arrive early 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.740
 Pre-van limited more 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.760
