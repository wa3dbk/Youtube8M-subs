I really like the draw it theme and the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.190 
I really like the draw it theme and the
blackboard<00:02:13.060> theme<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.850> would<00:02:16.690> choose<00:02:16.900> one

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
blackboard theme so I would choose one

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.420 
blackboard theme so I would choose one
of<00:02:17.230> these<00:02:17.530> two<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:20.260> can<00:02:20.470> also<00:02:20.650> customize

your<00:02:21.820> theme<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:24.550> think<00:02:25.330> I'm<00:02:25.570> not<00:02:25.690> sure<00:02:25.750> that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
your theme and I think I'm not sure that

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.490 
your theme and I think I'm not sure that
you<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.430> create<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.730> new<00:02:28.000> theme<00:02:28.330> based<00:02:29.080> on

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
you you can create a new theme based on

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.580 
you you can create a new theme based on
a<00:02:30.150> SFG<00:02:31.150> file<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.810> means<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.350> can

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
a SFG file that means that you can

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.360 
a SFG file that means that you can
create<00:02:32.980> your<00:02:33.370> own<00:02:34.110> keyboard<00:02:35.110> using<00:02:35.710> Inkscape

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
create your own keyboard using Inkscape

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.600 
create your own keyboard using Inkscape
and<00:02:36.700> saving<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> file<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:38.170> SVG<00:02:38.770> format<00:02:39.340> but

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
and saving the file in SVG format but

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.840 
and saving the file in SVG format but
I'm<00:02:39.730> not<00:02:39.880> sure<00:02:40.090> about<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.530> try<00:02:41.800> it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
I'm not sure about this I have to try it

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.330 
I'm not sure about this I have to try it
however<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.690> would<00:02:44.140> use<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.590> Droid<00:02:44.920> keyboard

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
however I would use the Droid keyboard

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.300 
however I would use the Droid keyboard
that<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.610> very<00:02:46.150> good<00:02:46.470> if<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.560> want<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.980> install

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
that is very good if you want to install

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.360 
that is very good if you want to install
some<00:02:48.900> application<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.530> are<00:02:50.560> very<00:02:50.950> useful
