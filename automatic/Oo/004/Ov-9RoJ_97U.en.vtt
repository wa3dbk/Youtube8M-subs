00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
I'm not sure I will test that out and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.970 
I'm not sure I will test that out and
give<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.420> kind<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> an<00:03:24.930> update<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.320> my<00:03:25.620> blog<00:03:25.860> or

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
something what it does with really heat

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.729 
something what it does with really heat

and humidity but the BB cream all around

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.740 
and humidity but the BB cream all around
has<00:03:32.100> been<00:03:32.280> really<00:03:32.579> good<00:03:32.760> now<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.180> will<00:03:33.480> say<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
has been really good now I will say that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.930 
has been really good now I will say that
this<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.230> probably<00:03:34.260> half<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.950> shade<00:03:35.130> too<00:03:35.579> dark

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
this is probably half a shade too dark

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.180 
this is probably half a shade too dark
for<00:03:36.030> me<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.350> lighter<00:03:37.560> shade<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.070> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
for me this is the lighter shade that it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.310 
for me this is the lighter shade that it
does<00:03:38.340> come<00:03:38.609> in<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.480> be<00:03:39.630> wary<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.019> if

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
does come in so do be wary of that if

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.539 
does come in so do be wary of that if

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
kind of works really really good or a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.890 
kind of works really really good or a

powder that is one shade lighter than
you<00:03:58.109> normally<00:03:58.230> would<00:03:58.410> use<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.160> just

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
you normally would use and it just

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.590 
you normally would use and it just
blends<00:03:59.609> in<00:03:59.790> perfectly<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.239> that's<00:04:00.450> actually

because some
humanizes<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.290> are<00:04:16.380> built-in<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:17.190> make<00:04:17.310> you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
humanizes that are built-in can make you

covering<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.440> very<00:04:22.680> good<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.100> very<00:04:23.340> much<00:04:23.550> a

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
covering is very good it's very much a

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.160 
covering is very good it's very much a
light<00:04:23.910> medium<00:04:24.090> coverage<00:04:24.690> which<00:04:24.870> I'm<00:04:25.020> happy

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
light medium coverage which I'm happy

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.960 
light medium coverage which I'm happy
with<00:04:25.470> for<00:04:25.710> every<00:04:25.920> day<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.340> mean<00:04:26.850> is

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
with for every day I mean is

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.550 
with for every day I mean is
moisturizing<00:04:27.720> like<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.960> said<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.170> doesn't<00:04:28.320> get

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
moisturizing like I said it doesn't get

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.950 
moisturizing like I said it doesn't get
over<00:04:28.920> drying<00:04:29.130> on<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.340> skin<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:30.630> says

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
over drying on the skin it says

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.990 
over drying on the skin it says
balancing<00:04:31.650> here<00:04:31.920> so<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.310> would<00:04:32.550> presume<00:04:32.940> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
balancing here so I would presume that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.820 
balancing here so I would presume that
it's<00:04:33.210> good<00:04:33.450> for<00:04:33.660> combination<00:04:34.200> skin<00:04:34.230> as<00:04:34.680> well

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
it's good for combination skin as well

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.460 
it's good for combination skin as well
as<00:04:35.010> oily<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.700> correcting<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.720> does<00:04:37.080> correct

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
as oily and correcting it does correct

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.080 
as oily and correcting it does correct
out<00:04:37.620> little<00:04:37.860> bits<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.130> can<00:04:38.400> use<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.670> little<00:04:38.910> bit

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
out little bits I can use a little bit

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.550 
out little bits I can use a little bit
extra<00:04:39.360> underneath<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.870> eyes<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.320> it's<00:04:40.410> almost

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
extra underneath my eyes and it's almost

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.590 
extra underneath my eyes and it's almost
like<00:04:40.800> an<00:04:40.920> under-eye<00:04:41.160> concealer<00:04:41.730> so<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.360> give<00:04:42.570> a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
like an under-eye concealer so I give a

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.270 
like an under-eye concealer so I give a
really<00:04:43.050> good<00:04:43.080> point<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.560> that<00:04:43.770> one<00:04:43.920> for<00:04:44.160> this

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
really good point to that one for this

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.400 
really good point to that one for this
BB<00:04:44.670> cream<00:04:44.880> because<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.450> can<00:04:45.690> use<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.140> a

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
BB cream because you can use it as a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.350 
BB cream because you can use it as a
spot<00:04:46.740> concealer<00:04:47.100> underneath<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.730> eyes<00:04:47.910> which

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
spot concealer underneath the eyes which

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.620 
spot concealer underneath the eyes which
is<00:04:48.570> fantastic<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:50.340> then<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.510> it

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
is fantastic and then this is that it

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.260 
is fantastic and then this is that it
also<00:04:51.780> protects<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.530> skin<00:04:52.830> as<00:04:53.220> well<00:04:53.490> now<00:04:53.820> I'm

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
also protects the skin as well now I'm
