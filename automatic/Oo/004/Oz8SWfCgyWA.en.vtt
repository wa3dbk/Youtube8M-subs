better ones yet and it's relatively

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.310 
better ones yet and it's relatively

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.490 
okay next we're going to show you that
we<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.620> lose<00:02:34.739> any<00:02:34.950> responsiveness<00:02:36.500> within

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
we don't lose any responsiveness within

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.140 
we don't lose any responsiveness within
the<00:02:37.590> drum<00:02:37.830> pad<00:02:38.040> itself<00:02:38.340> by<00:02:38.580> putting<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.910> pads

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
the drum pad itself by putting the pads

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.690 
the drum pad itself by putting the pads
on<00:02:39.420> we'll<00:02:40.290> go<00:02:40.680> ahead<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.920> hit<00:02:41.010> some<00:02:41.220> blue<00:02:41.459> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
on we'll go ahead and hit some blue and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.670 
on we'll go ahead and hit some blue and
some<00:02:41.849> yellow<00:02:42.150> got<00:02:42.630> scrolling<00:02:43.170> up<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.380> down<00:02:43.470> on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
some yellow got scrolling up and down on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280 
some yellow got scrolling up and down on
the<00:02:43.769> menu<00:02:44.069> here<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> show<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:45.290> both

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the menu here to show you that both

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:14.720 
the menu here to show you that both
options<00:02:46.769> work<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.340> well

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.309 

and<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.360> also<00:03:15.480> believe<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.290> probably

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
and I also believe that it probably

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.280 
and I also believe that it probably
gives<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.250> little<00:03:17.400> more<00:03:17.520> bounce<00:03:17.940> back<00:03:18.300> with<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
gives a little more bounce back with the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.580 
gives a little more bounce back with the
foam<00:03:19.590> pads<00:03:19.890> then<00:03:20.280> without<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.060> foam<00:03:21.269> pads<00:03:21.590> I'm

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
foam pads then without the foam pads I'm

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.020 
foam pads then without the foam pads I'm
not<00:03:22.650> sure<00:03:22.950> about<00:03:23.040> compared<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.640> gum<00:03:23.819> rubber

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
not sure about compared to gum rubber

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.650 
not sure about compared to gum rubber
but<00:03:25.430> these<00:03:26.430> pads<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:27.120> will<00:03:27.150> work<00:03:27.390> pretty<00:03:27.540> well

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
but these pads you will work pretty well

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.100 
but these pads you will work pretty well
with<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.140> responds<00:03:29.420> okay<00:03:30.420> here's<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.989> end

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
with the responds okay here's the end

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.680 
with the responds okay here's the end
