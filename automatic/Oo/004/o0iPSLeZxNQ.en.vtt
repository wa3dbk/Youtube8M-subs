00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
wrong as I've just got a tuning but

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
wrong as I've just got a tuning but
there's<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.470> good<00:00:25.740> at<00:00:25.920> altering<00:00:26.490> things<00:00:26.760> but

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630 
there's so good at altering things but
yeah<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> time<00:00:27.869> when<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.340> repeat<00:00:29.340> things

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
yeah it's a time when we repeat things

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.120 
yeah it's a time when we repeat things
over<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.119> over<00:00:30.300> again

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130

going over it and I saw worked out one

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180 
going over it and I saw worked out one
time<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:48.390> many<00:00:48.450> times<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.140> listened<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.010> song

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
time how many times I listened to a song

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
time how many times I listened to a song

before it gets to radio it's in the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100 
before it gets to radio it's in the
thousands<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.110> because

they're nice little songs that we can

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.760 
they're nice little songs that we can
focus<00:03:41.550> ly<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.450> we're<00:03:42.840> well<00:03:43.080> prepared<00:03:43.260> it's

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
focus ly so we're well prepared it's

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.850 
focus ly so we're well prepared it's
just<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.430> stage<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.060> sort<00:03:45.360> of<00:03:45.560> it's<00:03:46.560> not<00:03:46.650> as

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
just this stage it's sort of it's not as

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.220 
just this stage it's sort of it's not as
serious<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.489> make-or-break

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
serious as make-or-break

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.630 
serious as make-or-break
but<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> sort<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.680> like<00:03:49.800> feels<00:03:50.070> as<00:03:50.190> up<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.489> go

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
but it sort of like feels as up can go

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.580 
but it sort of like feels as up can go
on<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:50.850> way<00:03:50.910> another<00:03:51.300> with<00:03:51.540> every<00:03:51.750> song<00:03:51.959> each

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
on one way another with every song each

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.850 
on one way another with every song each
something<00:03:53.160> like<00:03:54.050> go<00:03:55.050> up<00:03:55.080> start<00:03:55.530> sounding

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
sounded a bit dreary and the last one

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.979 
sounded a bit dreary and the last one
we're<00:04:12.000> doing<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.269> probably<00:04:12.540> only<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.870> heard

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989

we're doing you probably only just heard
a<00:04:13.230> little<00:04:13.680> bit<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.190> we're<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.239> trying<00:04:15.420> to

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
a little bit of it we're just trying to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.420 
a little bit of it we're just trying to
get<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.660> bridge<00:04:15.840> going<00:04:16.080> into<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.350> chorus<00:04:16.680> do

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
get the bridge going into the chorus do

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.830 
get the bridge going into the chorus do
can<00:04:17.850> I'll<00:04:17.970> go<00:04:18.090> one<00:04:18.269> way<00:04:18.390> or<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.540> other<00:04:18.600> and

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
can I'll go one way or the other and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.780 
can I'll go one way or the other and
they're<00:04:18.959> usually<00:04:19.160> through<00:04:20.160> my<00:04:20.310> experience<00:04:20.700> of

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
they're usually through my experience of

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.860 
they're usually through my experience of
working<00:04:20.940> with<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.239> band<00:04:21.419> they<00:04:21.510> usually<00:04:21.600> go

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
working with this band they usually go

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.930 
working with this band they usually go
the<00:04:21.989> right<00:04:22.200> way<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:23.250> do<00:04:23.400> lose<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.820> odd

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
the right way but you do lose the odd

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.240 
the right way but you do lose the odd
one

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.969 

well<00:04:27.250> we're<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:29.020> think<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.560> third<00:04:29.740> or

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
well we're in I think it's the third or

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.710 
well we're in I think it's the third or
fourth<00:04:30.220> we<00:04:30.400> could<00:04:30.550> rehearse<00:04:30.639> Ida<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.330> don't

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
fourth we could rehearse Ida I don't

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.839 
fourth we could rehearse Ida I don't
come<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.259> first<00:04:32.530> week<00:04:32.800> because<00:04:33.699> they've

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
come to the first week because they've

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.969 
come to the first week because they've
just<00:04:33.879> got<00:04:34.120> any<00:04:34.300> new<00:04:34.419> songs<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.020> fresh<00:04:35.319> I<00:04:35.620> think

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
just got any new songs and fresh I think

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.200 
just got any new songs and fresh I think
so<00:04:36.159> they've<00:04:36.280> got<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.550> pick<00:04:36.759> the<00:04:36.879> way<00:04:36.970> around

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
so they've got to pick the way around

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.240 
so they've got to pick the way around
them<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.960> came<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.349> a<00:04:38.409> couple<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.740> days<00:04:38.949> on

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
them and I came in a couple of days on

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.309 
them and I came in a couple of days on
the<00:04:39.520> second<00:04:39.909> week<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.659> a<00:04:40.750> couple<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:41.050> days<00:04:41.139> on

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
the second week and a couple of days on

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.050 
the second week and a couple of days on
the<00:04:41.379> third<00:04:41.560> way<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:41.919> this<00:04:42.039> week<00:04:42.669> I've<00:04:42.879> been

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
the third way and this week I've been

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.909 
the third way and this week I've been
most<00:04:43.300> days<00:04:43.629> so<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.259> think<00:04:44.319> he's<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.680> fourth

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
most days so I think he's the fourth

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.249 
most days so I think he's the fourth
week<00:04:45.159> at<00:04:45.879> King's<00:04:46.090> Arms<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.690> then<00:04:46.780> we<00:04:46.900> move<00:04:47.080> on

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
week at King's Arms and then we move on

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.070 
week at King's Arms and then we move on
to<00:04:47.289> blueprint<00:04:47.919> after<00:04:48.819> that<00:04:48.970> and<00:04:49.479> we<00:04:49.569> do<00:04:49.750> four

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
to blueprint after that and we do four

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.050 
to blueprint after that and we do four
weeks<00:04:50.319> of<00:04:50.440> blueprint<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.099> then<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:51.819> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
weeks of blueprint and then it's the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.520 
weeks of blueprint and then it's the
album<00:04:52.389> starts<00:04:52.750> recording

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
album starts recording

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.029 
album starts recording

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
I think it's on 21st of April 20th of

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.820 
I think it's on 21st of April 20th of
