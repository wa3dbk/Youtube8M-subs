00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 but youtube uses chimpanzee and that 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.130
 Here is the Battlefield 4 field trial 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.540
 where you can determine your eco account 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.550
 which weapon and which one I have 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 to play the first episode and how 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.880
 The whole thing is of course totally 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.559
 simply first pictures to your wish 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.820
 suggest below you the comments 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 and or offers another 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.510
 corner up or down 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.130
 if he does not like you at all 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.170
 like and last time had 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.000
 we yes, I'll say a relatively coal 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 setup this time not right 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.890
 that sugar has chris with his 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 setup your brave thumbs up 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 driven and has only 32 votes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 the best setup and indeed 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.079
 primary was for ump 45 m2 with 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.879
 silencer that means for me me 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.340
 I have no other tags on it 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 made no scope, no nothing just 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 the pure silencer secondary g 18 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 exactly the same also not further 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 then packed gadget no matter what 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.670
 means with me as much as used on 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.500
 Nothing at all and as grenade the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 blendgranate so the flashback to it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.530
 that tantow knife and upgrade was him 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.329
 no matter, I have that normal 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.370
 Assault upgrade also taken when I 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 had to play here with the pioneer of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.409
 city yet I resisted done 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 but four still argue these perpetrators 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.430
 good means as much as the modern warfare 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 2 It is actually setup but never mind 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 the whole thing is pretty good for me 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.840
 I have it on work 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 different servers today during the day 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.020
 unfortunately we played very fast 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 very fast 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 very fast chaotic and unterm 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.390
 I have different on different 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 I have played nomination maps 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.590
 personally most bob now 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.250
 simmons honestly when i setup a cod 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.560
 It does not work here 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.240
 that in the rush mode or speaks in the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.760
 conquest mode up and down to gamble 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 because most are the maps lcd but a 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.330
 Bit smaller now you can me 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.190
 said if the pugs modern warfare 2 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.380
 for example, bigger or 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.390
 accordingly , smaller is like that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.729
 my personal feeling there 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.790
 accordingly so true 45 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.190
 excellent because I have exactly 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.080
 with this weapon still some kills form 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.810
 here and for that for the 500th 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.910
 Children speak for this little task 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.470
 which I have given myself now 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.720
 I'll give you the next one again 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.119
 task for the next setup 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.040
 please a weapon from this 500th 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.260
 challenge you will find below in the video 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.090
 description a link to my 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.800
 present status was yes yes I do two 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.630
 small scavenger hunt or postings and 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.890
 small balance and all weapons 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.230
 which are not yet green so at the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.400
 I still managed not 500 kills the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.630
 you may like to come back next time 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.340
 evaluable are also real bangers 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.560
 with it and find you are yes 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.720
 because that's just the right thing 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.280
 some of the first few shop quite yes 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.620
 So there is in principle still air 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.550
 top left right and in principle also 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.230
 back to the back 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.780
 if it is something longer again 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.820
 In any case , should be clock p45 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.290
 course in battlefield 4 a pdw 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.780
 So say a person wanted the fans 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.940
 which you can only play with the pioneer 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.519
 Unfortunately I have to say I found it 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.200
 actually cooler in the past and that is 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.519
 Of course, always not missing 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.410
 have been playing silencers for so long 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.540
 means as much as yes you can do with it 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.010
 flanking does not always work 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 relatively good sometimes a little bit better 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 sometimes a little bit worse and me 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.940
 Got it now I believe the two 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.100
 gameplays from operation loose and or 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
 still packed with dragon pasta and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.820
 both apps are actually quite suitable 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.709
 good for the opponent a bit 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.239
 to flank or sometimes so completely 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.560
 to run so especially at all right 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.200
 that can always be casual in between 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.090
 But I'll tell you how it is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.799
 The teams special operation loose the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.519
 were a little bit stronger have become good 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.420
 agreed 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.950
 and I did not really have that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.519
 cuts at the bottleneck saw it all 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.440
 different 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.940
 half of us have our team 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.470
 The other half has dominated 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.329
 I am dominated by the opposing team 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.860
 but at both matches with relative 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.390
 good scores ran out of it can 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.070
 In places you can just be satisfied 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.300
 for such a casual gamer for me that is 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.280
 absolutely in the green area 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.530
 I'm not that honest 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.600
 often unpacked one or the other 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.370
 but certainly that is one 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.990
 I really answer them 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.300
 Everyone can learn to appreciate 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.980
 you can testify or can each of you 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.480
 like to try this is not 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.070
 okay so lehwald against a bit 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.110
 continue to change you meet nothing more 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.740
 At a distance, it is natural 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.810
 just such a ball spray wonder 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.970
 yes the thing skin balls out without end 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.770
 loads extremely fast maybe has 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.150
 not the best precision euro is 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.550
 it was very fast on it 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.900
 the floor and stay tuned had it good 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.790
 Of course you have to do the best 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.440
 have 21 hands on and off doing that 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.850
 you have to be a toddler again 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.500
 I once even made me so 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.169
 kill yourself and on the other 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.760
 side only because you in principle marca 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.200
 gets when a blend grenade interior 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.060
 That does not mean you're all thrown 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.530
 or really everyone in the room 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.180
 have is really fake 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.590
 and even if they 've flashed now 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.669
 finally how much they are flashed 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.350
 they might not see anything else 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.490
 can or just wild through the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.110
 area and then shoot at the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.510
 so jump in at the rhine 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.040
 so to speak off yes that's me 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.770
 one or the other happens from there 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.900
 I say blendgranate beautiful toy 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.580
 in battlefield, however, only with 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.660
 caution to enjoy tantow knife is 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.850
 for me a knife we ​​saw smoke 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.040
 looks a bit different but does 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.570
 also so much fun and the last sentence 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.680
 I also quoted to say what I 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.479
 but no battlefield 4 writes 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.370
 Nevertheless, I think this setup is great 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.780
 think it's great that you're watching the videos 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.490
 and to look yes even if you do not 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.380
 profession with four players is no active 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.940
 Just come in and watch 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.470
 just have fun with later times 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.900
 Buck on battlefield did you have 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.120
 probably the best source for yes 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.400
 dullness and many other things like 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.930
 on other channels of course, too 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.669
 I say thank you for that 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.380
 my name is chimpanzee that 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.150
 was the wetfeet field trial for this 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.650
 week and now I say 'you can do it 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.900
 the keys horn writes me neat 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.760
 comments writes the setups here 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.560
 whether the fun things are whether that 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.880
 really good stories are me 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.800
 no matter the main thing they have 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.390
 any topic and also offers please 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.410
 existing comments up or 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.729
 downward 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.700
 See you next week 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.020
 Again, I am purely lounging comments 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.410
 I hope this week I hope 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.389
 pair 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.590
 I think I also have a few coming 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.060
 Selected first jim rumen you notice 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.460
 to that, please do not say all my video 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.659
 so the new document is a video of 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.020
 fischer function I find great 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.659
 also from trackmania why is there one 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.909
 tree in the hall back I'm for 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:01.370
 a comment with cent no matter which and 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:02.539
 from beginning to end July starts her 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.970
 against the cholera 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.919
 What's wrong with the reverse 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.840
 Field trial is not there with me 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.210
 really cool if a boom again 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.210
 cut, according to this one
