00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.190
 beauty you already have the most important is that we start working with 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.920
 the new guidelines 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.620
 how to imagine 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.400

 this 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.859
 let's take action to the left of the box and add a few touches that taken under the
