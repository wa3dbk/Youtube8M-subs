00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello my name is patric heizmann in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.110
 this video is about digestion 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.110
 hose which makes a really good mood 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 because in the bowel becomes a large part of the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.359
 happiness hormone produces serotonin 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.690
 if the gut is healthy he is happy 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.730
 the human being 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.189
 it's not health in it now 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.380
 necessarily a Stammtisch topic and at 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 prosecco with friends there you talk 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.210
 Neither about the digestion or there 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 he knows because then exciting topic because 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.360
 in the intestine next to it more bacteria than the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.519
 human body cells has the lady 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 So they do not just decide 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:54.379
 our mood but above all 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.379
 the health and our vitality 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.629
 if the intestine has three wishes 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.629
 then see the like 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.159
 fiber is that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.350
 cleaning service for your gut 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.960
 because the fibers scrub yours 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 intestinal lightning and just the whole 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 mist there is not there again with 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.909
 All the stuff stuck in the outside 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.930
 fruits vegetables and legumes and also 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.930
 in wholemeal products 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.020
 Drink Drink You Can 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.630
 daily two liters 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.270
 and I'm not talking about alcohol until 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.880
 resting the pupil even if omi 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.860
 the best is the tip of a schnapps 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.620
 to stimulate digestion 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.770
 the complete nonsense on the contrary 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.780
 alcohol stress because then really 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.690
 and it blocks the burning of fat like that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.690
 long until it is completely broken down 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.330
 then biologics and spices do so then 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.650
 really good 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.380
 and because he does that, too 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.610
 Headquarters of the immune system is power 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.780
 that is a powerful defense troop 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.729
 and as a coronation it could also 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.210
 irresistibly good mood 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.970
 make probiotic yoghurts sauerkraut 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340
 help those by so far lousy food 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.350
 selection unfavorable intestine 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.200
 to push bacteria out of the gut and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.140
 to replace it with good bacteria 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.480
 The good intestinal bacteria should also turn off 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.110
 and get her favorite food 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 So-called organic foods for 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.450
 for example the chorea artichokes 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.980
 parsnip or onions and parsnip 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.440
 when you now then eat with 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.390
 turmeric or caraway spice then freaks 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.940
 then anticipation is likely 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.370
 completely out because these spices are one 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.370
 head when it comes to intestinal health
