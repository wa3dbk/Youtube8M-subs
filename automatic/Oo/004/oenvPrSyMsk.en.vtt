00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
dry tip that way and it won't be able to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.170 
dry tip that way and it won't be able to
actually<00:02:00.930> push<00:02:01.320> anything<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
as usual if neither of these things

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.119 
as usual if neither of these things
works<00:02:41.459> then<00:02:42.450> your<00:02:42.659> next<00:02:43.019> option<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.889> go<00:02:44.069> to

water<00:05:14.360> cleaning<00:05:14.720> station<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.500> works<00:05:15.710> for

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
water cleaning station it works for

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.010 
water cleaning station it works for
almost<00:05:16.070> any<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.610> them<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.390> just<00:05:17.630> put<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
almost any of them and you just put the

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.530 
almost any of them and you just put the
tip<00:05:18.230> down<00:05:18.560> in<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.670> will<00:05:19.820> actually<00:05:20.030> use

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
tip down in it and it will actually use

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.210 
tip down in it and it will actually use
some<00:05:20.750> kind<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:20.960> ultrasonic<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:21.950> run<00:05:22.130> it

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
some kind of ultrasonic and run it

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.260 
some kind of ultrasonic and run it
through<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.910> blah<00:05:23.150> blah<00:05:23.180> blah<00:05:23.950> I'm<00:05:25.000> cheap<00:05:26.000> I

up another guys on the internet had some

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.370 
up another guys on the internet had some
teflon<00:05:49.880> tape<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.390> think<00:05:50.630> he<00:05:50.720> said<00:05:50.960> that<00:05:51.110> he<00:05:51.170> put

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
teflon tape I think he said that he put

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.160 
teflon tape I think he said that he put
on<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.620> threads<00:05:51.980> here<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:53.030> keep<00:05:53.300> that<00:05:53.600> sealed

very well between there I might could

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.040 
very well between there I might could

God<00:07:02.400> and<00:07:02.730> now<00:07:03.330> this<00:07:03.660> one<00:07:04.020> apparently<00:07:04.470> there<00:07:04.920> is

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
God and now this one apparently there is

God and now this one apparently there is
some<00:07:05.250> kind<00:07:05.460> of<00:07:05.670> in<00:07:05.820> this<00:07:06.000> brand<00:07:06.330> of<00:07:06.450> compressor

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170 
some kind of in this brand of compressor

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.470 
some kind of in this brand of compressor
some<00:07:07.920> kind<00:07:08.130> of<00:07:08.160> air<00:07:08.430> leak<00:07:08.670> somewhere

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
some kind of air leak somewhere

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.780 
some kind of air leak somewhere
because<00:07:09.930> this<00:07:10.320> is<00:07:10.530> now<00:07:10.770> staying<00:07:11.520> on

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
because this is now staying on

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.850 
because this is now staying on
continuously<00:07:12.630> when<00:07:12.930> I'm<00:07:13.020> having<00:07:13.320> to<00:07:13.410> use<00:07:13.440> it

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
continuously when I'm having to use it

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.450 
continuously when I'm having to use it
and<00:07:14.750> it's<00:07:15.750> not<00:07:16.050> filling<00:07:16.500> up<00:07:16.620> the<00:07:16.770> tank<00:07:16.950> anymore

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
and it's not filling up the tank anymore

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.240 
and it's not filling up the tank anymore
and<00:07:17.760> it<00:07:18.540> actually<00:07:18.810> has<00:07:19.230> these<00:07:19.440> moments<00:07:19.740> even

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
and it actually has these moments even

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.190 
and it actually has these moments even
in<00:07:20.610> the<00:07:20.700> middle<00:07:21.000> of<00:07:21.120> using<00:07:21.540> it<00:07:21.660> where<00:07:21.840> for<00:07:22.050> no

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200 
in the middle of using it where for no

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680 
in the middle of using it where for no
apparent<00:07:22.320> reason<00:07:22.680> the<00:07:23.670> needle<00:07:24.090> will<00:07:24.330> go<00:07:24.450> all

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
apparent reason the needle will go all

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.530 
apparent reason the needle will go all
the<00:07:24.720> way<00:07:25.350> back<00:07:25.710> down<00:07:26.010> as<00:07:26.370> all<00:07:26.580> the<00:07:27.030> air<00:07:27.180> comes

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
the way back down as all the air comes

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.960 
the way back down as all the air comes
back<00:07:27.810> down<00:07:27.990> out<00:07:28.290> of<00:07:28.440> it<00:07:28.590> so<00:07:28.950> I<00:07:29.250> don't<00:07:29.670> know

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970 
back down out of it so I don't know

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.120 
back down out of it so I don't know
what's<00:07:30.210> going<00:07:30.510> on<00:07:30.660> there<00:07:30.960> I<00:07:30.990> opened<00:07:31.440> it<00:07:31.740> up<00:07:31.890> in

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130 
what's going on there I opened it up in

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.250 
what's going on there I opened it up in
desperation<00:07:32.700> and<00:07:33.120> put<00:07:33.390> duct<00:07:33.630> tape<00:07:33.660> around

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.260 
desperation and put duct tape around

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.310 
desperation and put duct tape around
every<00:07:34.620> seal<00:07:34.890> I<00:07:34.920> could<00:07:35.340> find<00:07:35.610> and<00:07:36.060> to<00:07:36.960> try<00:07:37.260> to

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.320 
every seal I could find and to try to

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.770 
every seal I could find and to try to
