00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hi hello everyone today I'm going to show you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.810
 how to make a tang braid 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.670
 inverted is a different way of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 make the tang braid that all 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.160
 we know and we will start holding 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.770
 our hair with a little league 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.170
 this will help us make it easier 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.350
 make this braid I will divide my 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.390
 hair in two equal sections of a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.840
 of the sections I'm going to take a small 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.300
 section of the shore and the step towards 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 contrary section but not how I do it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 in the normal tang braid that is by 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.370
 the forward part this section I'm going 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.640
 to go through the back to the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 opposite section now of this section 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.469
 I'm going to take a small section of the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.809
 shore and the step towards the section 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.840
 contrary from the back 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.140
 we do this again I take a small 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.200
 section of the shore and the step towards 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 reverse section from the back 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.720
 Now from this section I take a small 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.790
 section of the shore and I pass it by the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.180
 back to the section 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.280
 opposite we repeat these steps all over 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.730
 how long we want the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730
 braid 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.650
 It is very important that the sections 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.920
 little girls that we drink are the same 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.920
 size 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.450
 as we have finished doing the will 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.930
 to fasten my braid with a rubber band 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 same color of my hair I try to give 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.780
 a little volume to my braid pulling 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.940
 a little hair and finally I'm going to 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.430
 cut the liguita from the top 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.430
 so that the braid looks better 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.150
 I hope you liked it I send them 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.390
 many kisses and see you in the next 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.390
