00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
right up there with CM Punk as far as

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560 
right up there with CM Punk as far as
what<00:01:46.409> he<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> TNA<00:01:47.340> vs<00:01:47.820> CM<00:01:48.030> Punk<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> mean

what he does in TNA vs CM Punk I mean

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.139

think that Austin Aries is his mic work

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.230 
think that Austin Aries is his mic work
in<00:01:54.329> TNA<00:01:54.630> has<00:01:54.720> been<00:01:54.899> good<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:56.189> great<00:01:56.549> I'm

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
in TNA has been good but not great I'm

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
some of the other guys but but the thing

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.270 
some of the other guys but but the thing
is<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.570> Booker<00:03:26.380> T<00:03:26.530> goes<00:03:26.770> into<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.100> Hall<00:03:27.250> of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920

I think that you know they might be

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.540 
I think that you know they might be
better<00:03:53.200> off<00:03:53.320> going<00:03:53.500> into<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.160> hall<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.310> fame

as a tag team just because there was

later in WCW during the Monday Night
Wars<00:04:16.840> so<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.590> think<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:18.040> Steiner<00:04:18.310> Brothers<00:04:18.430> you

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
Wars so I think the Steiner Brothers you

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.520 
Wars so I think the Steiner Brothers you
know<00:04:19.000> if<00:04:19.150> there's<00:04:19.330> going<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.630> be<00:04:19.690> like<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.930> WCW

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
know if there's going to be like a WCW

wing<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.130> Hall<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.370> Fame<00:04:21.669> i<00:04:21.700> think<00:04:22.120> that

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
wing to the Hall of Fame i think that

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.300 
wing to the Hall of Fame i think that
the<00:04:22.870> Steiner<00:04:23.110> Brothers<00:04:23.200> would<00:04:23.680> absolutely<00:04:23.950> be

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the Steiner Brothers would absolutely be

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.030 
the Steiner Brothers would absolutely be
going<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:24.729> no<00:04:24.970> doubt<00:04:25.150> about<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.630> I

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
going in no doubt about it and I

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.200 
going in no doubt about it and I
I<00:04:26.070> think<00:04:26.430> they<00:04:26.550> should<00:04:26.760> be<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.060> Hall<00:04:27.180> of

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
I think they should be in the Hall of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.110 
I think they should be in the Hall of
Fame<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.690> as<00:04:28.350> far<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:28.620> nasty<00:04:28.950> boys<00:04:29.280> go<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.760> think

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
Fame and as far as nasty boys go I think

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.650 
Fame and as far as nasty boys go I think
that<00:04:30.270> that's<00:04:30.800> unlikely<00:04:31.800> unless<00:04:32.240> Houk<00:04:33.240> Hogan

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
that that's unlikely unless Houk Hogan

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.620 
that that's unlikely unless Houk Hogan
gets<00:04:33.690> on<00:04:33.990> good<00:04:34.170> terms<00:04:34.410> with<00:04:34.560> WWE<00:04:35.160> again<00:04:35.310> then

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
gets on good terms with WWE again then

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.210 
gets on good terms with WWE again then
we<00:04:36.630> could<00:04:36.780> consider<00:04:37.110> nasty<00:04:37.380> boys<00:04:37.740> go<00:04:37.920> in<00:04:38.070> you

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
we could consider nasty boys go in you

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.430 
we could consider nasty boys go in you
know<00:04:38.340> as<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> political<00:04:39.180> favor<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.930> hold<00:04:40.110> cokin

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
know as a political favor to hold cokin

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.010

could see that happening you know a lot

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.440 
could see that happening you know a lot
of<00:05:53.280> people<00:05:53.370> would<00:05:53.640> be<00:05:53.730> disappointed<00:05:54.300> with<00:05:54.420> I

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
finish unless you have both guys get

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.170 
finish unless you have both guys get
counted<00:05:58.020> out<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:58.350> then<00:05:58.650> Dolph<00:05:59.460> Ziggler<00:05:59.610> comes

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
counted out and then Dolph Ziggler comes

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.970 
counted out and then Dolph Ziggler comes
down<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:00.780> caches<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.260> money<00:06:01.590> in<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.770> bank

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
down and caches and money in the bank

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.040 
down and caches and money in the bank
that<00:06:02.250> I<00:06:02.580> could<00:06:02.940> see<00:06:03.150> happening<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:03.720> think<00:06:03.930> that

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
that I could see happening I think that

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.230 
that I could see happening I think that
that's<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.470> decent<00:06:04.710> possibility<00:06:05.610> especially

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
that's a decent possibility especially

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.020 
that's a decent possibility especially
with<00:06:06.720> this<00:06:06.840> whole<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.410> Last<00:06:07.710> Man<00:06:07.830> Standing

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
with this whole on Last Man Standing

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.740 
with this whole on Last Man Standing
stipulation<00:06:09.030> it<00:06:09.120> makes<00:06:09.300> me<00:06:09.450> think

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
stipulation it makes me think

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.930 
stipulation it makes me think
something's<00:06:10.200> going<00:06:10.410> to<00:06:10.440> happen<00:06:10.500> here<00:06:10.890> but<00:06:11.220> if

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
something's going to happen here but if

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.490 
something's going to happen here but if
they<00:06:12.060> just<00:06:12.270> do<00:06:12.390> a<00:06:12.420> double<00:06:12.840> finish<00:06:13.200> and<00:06:13.380> that's

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
they just do a double finish and that's

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.320 
they just do a double finish and that's
the<00:06:13.680> end<00:06:13.770> of<00:06:13.860> it<00:06:13.980> no<00:06:14.160> cash<00:06:14.460> in<00:06:14.730> from<00:06:14.940> Ziggler

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
the end of it no cash in from Ziggler

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.630 
the end of it no cash in from Ziggler
that<00:06:16.080> would<00:06:16.230> be<00:06:16.380> a<00:06:16.410> huge<00:06:16.470> letdown<00:06:17.010> hopefully

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
that would be a huge letdown hopefully

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.150 
that would be a huge letdown hopefully
that<00:06:17.820> doesn't<00:06:18.000> happen<00:06:18.800> all<00:06:19.800> right<00:06:19.950> that'll

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
that doesn't happen all right that'll

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.950 
that doesn't happen all right that'll
