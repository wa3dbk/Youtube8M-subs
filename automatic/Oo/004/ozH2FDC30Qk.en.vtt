00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.530
 well then let's make an envelope or 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.230
 flat box to store or give away CDs 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.530
 or good or a note if you want as you see 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.430
 we're going to need a cedÃ© and two plates 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.630
 two sheets if they are on thick paper better 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 well then let's draw four 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.950
 cde size circles 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.540
 I have left the link to the store because 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.280
 you can download the digital paper 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.630
 this in particular and other models if 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.600
 you want, you can do it in any 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.800
 paper that you want a plain paper 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.250
 well, well, let's cut the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250
 circles 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.670
 and we have here the four of us are going to 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.090
 fold them in half, marking the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 fold 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.690
 well as you see the box placed 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.789
 it's not about that if there's one on top of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.469
 another as you can see we are not going to hit it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.079
 let's do a little more space 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.800
 let's put glue in the middle 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.680
 lower left and we put the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.659
 next the next circle we can 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.810
 do it so best folded in half and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.090
 looking for the perpendicular 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.619
 they have to be well perpendicular I 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.509
 helped me with this mat as you are 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.009
 seeing that it has lines but you can 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.840
 use anything else as a 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.759
 squad for example or some box that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.759
 have or good by marking some lines 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.990
 we continue placing the third 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.990
 and now the last one you have to lend a 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.579
 little attention 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.899
 in the first part we do the same 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.899
 we put glue 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.390
 we place the half if it doubles it is like 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.200
 I have to go inwards as you see 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.020
 leaving the line out and now as 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 you have seen I have passed the circle 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.770
 previous above 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.020
 well as you see we are exactly left 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.360
 the size of the cde 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.130
 following this method you see 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.900
 so if you want to give it away you put it 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 inside and you put a tape if not 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.940
 you can put a note inside or a 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.160
 good message what you want 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.819
 you can close it with a pretty sticker 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.890
 for example a rope loop 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.640
 or what you like most, I've done it 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.069
 as you see with a paper bow 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.120
 and here you have it is easy to open and 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.120
 lovely to give
