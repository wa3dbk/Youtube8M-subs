00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
was thinking about doing 40 40 long's

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.629 
was thinking about doing 40 40 long's
Bob<00:05:58.150> back-to-back<00:05:59.020> so<00:05:59.530> like<00:05:59.650> one<00:05:59.889> or<00:06:00.190> side<00:06:00.520> to

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
Bob back-to-back so like one or side to

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.060 
Bob back-to-back so like one or side to
side<00:06:00.669> or<00:06:00.849> whatever<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:01.360> like<00:06:01.539> you<00:06:02.289> know<00:06:02.320> to<00:06:02.680> 40

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
side or whatever so like you know to 40

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.129 
side or whatever so like you know to 40
logs<00:06:03.280> on<00:06:03.580> one<00:06:03.789> stand<00:06:04.120> and<00:06:04.389> then<00:06:04.479> underneath<00:06:04.930> of

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
logs on one stand and then underneath of

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.950 
logs on one stand and then underneath of
them<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.320> 40<00:06:05.620> long's<00:06:05.860> running<00:06:06.340> parallel<00:06:06.960> and

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
them to 40 long's running parallel and

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.050 
them to 40 long's running parallel and
that<00:06:08.110> would<00:06:08.260> get<00:06:08.440> me<00:06:08.470> 80<00:06:08.800> gallons<00:06:09.310> I've<00:06:09.669> also

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
that would get me 80 gallons I've also

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.300 
that would get me 80 gallons I've also
thought<00:06:10.210> about<00:06:10.360> doing

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
thought about doing

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.520 
thought about doing
40<00:06:11.970> Long's<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.510> then<00:06:12.600> doing<00:06:12.840> stacks<00:06:13.170> of<00:06:13.380> like

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
40 Long's and then doing stacks of like

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.640 
40 Long's and then doing stacks of like
tens<00:06:13.890> like<00:06:14.850> little<00:06:15.210> stacks<00:06:15.540> attends<00:06:16.050> this<00:06:16.410> way

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
tens like little stacks attends this way

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.110 
tens like little stacks attends this way
all<00:06:16.920> the<00:06:17.190> way<00:06:17.220> across<00:06:17.570> sideways<00:06:18.570> so<00:06:19.410> I<00:06:20.120> could

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
all the way across sideways so I could

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
all the way across sideways so I could
have<00:06:21.270> a<00:06:21.300> bunch<00:06:21.540> of<00:06:21.570> thing<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.810> problem<00:06:22.050> with

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
have a bunch of thing the problem with

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.270 
have a bunch of thing the problem with
that<00:06:22.170> is<00:06:22.290> doing<00:06:22.560> water<00:06:22.770> changes<00:06:22.860> would<00:06:23.190> be

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
that is doing water changes would be

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.710 
that is doing water changes would be
