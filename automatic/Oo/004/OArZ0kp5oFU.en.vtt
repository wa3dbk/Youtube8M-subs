00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.370 
wait and the idea is eventually there's
no<00:02:37.430> me<00:02:37.670> eventually<00:02:38.420> there's<00:02:38.569> no<00:02:38.690> lead<00:02:38.959> because

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
no me eventually there's no lead because

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.900 
no me eventually there's no lead because
you've<00:02:39.500> got<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> well-behaved<00:02:40.130> dog<00:02:40.160> but<00:02:40.849> we

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
you've got a well-behaved dog but we

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.220 
you've got a well-behaved dog but we
certainly<00:02:41.120> do<00:02:41.450> need<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:41.900> because<00:02:42.170> he

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
certainly do need it now because he

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:51.220 
certainly do need it now because he
doesn't<00:02:42.440> know<00:02:42.620> when<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.799> do<00:02:49.900> siren<00:02:50.900> oh<00:02:51.019> we've

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
also got another problem here and that's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.150 
also got another problem here and that's
that<00:02:53.120> Roy<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.410> too<00:02:54.560> comfortable<00:02:54.769> with

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
that Roy is not too comfortable with

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.699 
that Roy is not too comfortable with
having<00:02:55.280> little<00:02:55.640> max<00:02:55.850> approaching<00:02:56.660> him<00:02:56.870> yes<00:02:57.680> he

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
seems to be getting a little bit

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.319 
seems to be getting a little bit
frustrated<00:02:59.420> with<00:03:00.019> him<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.549> just<00:03:02.090> noticed

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
frustrated with him and I just noticed

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.770 
frustrated with him and I just noticed
that<00:03:02.920> he<00:03:03.920> seems<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.519> be<00:03:04.670> reaching<00:03:05.389> his<00:03:05.750> limit

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
that he seems to be reaching his limit

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.710 
that he seems to be reaching his limit
with<00:03:06.410> him<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> little<00:03:06.950> bit<00:03:07.130> more<00:03:07.519> he<00:03:08.359> used<00:03:08.569> to

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
with him a little bit more he used to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.900 
with him a little bit more he used to
put<00:03:08.930> up<00:03:09.049> with<00:03:09.230> quite<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.680> lot<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.880> know

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
put up with quite a lot of you know

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.970 
put up with quite a lot of you know
cuddles<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.780> kisses<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.680> sort<00:03:12.950> of

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
cuddles and kisses and that sort of

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.160 
cuddles and kisses and that sort of
thing<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.430> now<00:03:13.609> he<00:03:13.670> tends<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.569> be<00:03:14.660> moving<00:03:15.079> away

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
thing and now he tends to be moving away

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.599 
thing and now he tends to be moving away
a<00:03:15.350> lot<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:17.420> did<00:03:17.989> actually<00:03:18.200> see<00:03:18.769> him<00:03:19.100> kind<00:03:19.430> of

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
a lot and I did actually see him kind of

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.569 
a lot and I did actually see him kind of
snarl<00:03:20.120> at<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:20.630> point<00:03:20.930> like<00:03:21.380> quiver<00:03:22.010> his<00:03:22.250> lips

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
snarl at one point like quiver his lips

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.050 
snarl at one point like quiver his lips
and<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:24.170> really<00:03:24.680> worried<00:03:25.100> me<00:03:25.130> okay<00:03:25.850> well

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
and that really worried me okay well

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.940 
and that really worried me okay well
that's<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.299> warning<00:03:26.569> sign<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.079> we<00:03:27.319> do<00:03:27.620> need<00:03:27.829> to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
that's a warning sign so we do need to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.470 
that's a warning sign so we do need to
take<00:03:28.100> some<00:03:28.310> action<00:03:28.400> there<00:03:28.760> I've<00:03:29.150> got<00:03:29.180> some

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
take some action there I've got some

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.890 
take some action there I've got some
solutions<00:03:30.019> sure<00:03:31.359> there's<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.420> few<00:03:32.600> things<00:03:32.810> that

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
solutions sure there's a few things that

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
solutions sure there's a few things that
we<00:03:33.019> can<00:03:33.170> do<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.530> make<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.370> situation<00:03:34.970> between

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
we can do to make the situation between

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.170 
we can do to make the situation between
Roy<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.290> Max<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.980> lot<00:03:37.310> more<00:03:37.459> happier<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.030> one

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
Roy and Max a lot more happier and one

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.059 
Roy and Max a lot more happier and one
is<00:03:38.329> this<00:03:38.480> -<00:03:38.630> supervised<00:03:39.079> interactions<00:03:39.889> like

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
is this - supervised interactions like

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.830 
is this - supervised interactions like
these<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.670> as<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.819> can<00:03:40.940> see<00:03:41.180> I've<00:03:41.660> always

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
these and as you can see I've always

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.479 
these and as you can see I've always
been<00:03:41.989> really<00:03:42.230> polite<00:03:42.650> there<00:03:42.920> he<00:03:43.040> moved<00:03:43.280> away

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
been really polite there he moved away

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.690 
been really polite there he moved away
and<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.079> what<00:03:45.410> we<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:45.980> exactly<00:03:46.489> what

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
and this is what we this is exactly what

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.830 
and this is what we this is exactly what
we<00:03:46.790> need<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.090> sort<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.299> be<00:03:47.420> looking<00:03:47.660> out<00:03:47.810> for

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
we need to sort of be looking out for

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.690 
we need to sort of be looking out for
and<00:03:48.380> he's<00:03:48.530> been<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> good<00:03:49.040> boy<00:03:49.280> because<00:03:49.609> he's

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
and he's been a good boy because he's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.430 
and he's been a good boy because he's
been<00:03:49.849> passive<00:03:50.389> in<00:03:50.599> his<00:03:50.780> defensive<00:03:51.290> behavior

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
been passive in his defensive behavior

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.249 
been passive in his defensive behavior
he's<00:03:51.979> moving<00:03:52.340> away<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.479> again<00:03:53.780> he's<00:03:54.079> just

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
he's moving away and and again he's just

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.089 
he's moving away and and again he's just
laid<00:03:54.470> down<00:03:54.650> next<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:55.070> max<00:03:55.250> there

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
laid down next to max there

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.530 
laid down next to max there
it's<00:03:56.219> not<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:56.549> he's<00:03:56.670> really<00:03:56.999> worried<00:03:57.480> about

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it's not as if he's really worried about

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.569 
it's not as if he's really worried about
him<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:57.959> doesn't<00:03:58.349> like<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.459> he's

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
him it just doesn't like you know he's

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.009 
him it just doesn't like you know he's
just<00:03:59.700> getting<00:03:59.939> a<00:03:59.999> bit<00:04:00.120> impatient<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.780> too

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
just getting a bit impatient with too

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.289 
just getting a bit impatient with too
much<00:04:01.139> interaction<00:04:01.439> so<00:04:02.099> so<00:04:02.579> supervision<00:04:03.180> is

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
much interaction so so supervision is

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.449 
much interaction so so supervision is
the<00:04:03.420> number<00:04:03.659> one<00:04:03.840> key<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.769> another<00:04:05.249> thing

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
the number one key and another thing

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.610 
the number one key and another thing
that<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.700> need<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.939> do<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.329> Rene<00:04:06.689> is<00:04:07.079> let<00:04:07.439> Roy
