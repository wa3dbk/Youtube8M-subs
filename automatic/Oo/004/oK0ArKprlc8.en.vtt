00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:12.429
 I'll show you 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.490

 maintains the relationship but how many people have visited your website 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.779
 this functionality is not implemented as part of the html language 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.969
 simply because it can not be achieved in this way 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.090
 there are many websites or companies 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.630
 that give you kelso functionality 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.870

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.400
 site 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.020
 some companies 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.080
 they provide you with more functionalities to your page 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 that go way beyond a simple counter 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.690
 how to tell you what city and from what country 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.800
 well your visitors 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.250
 I will demonstrate how to include 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.610
 a very simple visitor counter that is available on the site 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.690
 shrinks cancer dot 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.820
 simply select the color of your counter 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 then select the background color 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.950
 press the d button with everything free 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.380
 and the page generates html code 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.980
 copy this code 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.840
 and then pegalÃ³n inside the podium label 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 in your source code of acs tml 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.490
 turn that file 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.820
 and refresh the page 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 now you will see your own accountant 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 on your page 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.340
