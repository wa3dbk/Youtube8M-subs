00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
which is just amazing in my opinion at

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
which is just amazing in my opinion at
least<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.540> go<00:01:36.689> back<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> way

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
least and then we go back all the way

least and then we go back all the way
over<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.310> once<00:01:38.490> again<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.030> isn't

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
over there but once again this isn't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
over there but once again this isn't
like<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> easily<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.860> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
like a really you can easily make this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.910 
like a really you can easily make this
so<00:01:44.130> much<00:01:44.189> cooler<00:01:44.750> just<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.229> ahead<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so much cooler just by going ahead and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
explain or try to explain this how this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
explain or try to explain this how this
works<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.600> sure<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> lot<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> guys<00:02:01.200> already

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
works I'm sure a lot of you guys already

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.760 
works I'm sure a lot of you guys already
see<00:02:02.850> how<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> works<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
see how it works and as you can see if I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.679 
see how it works and as you can see if I
let<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.219> by<00:02:05.399> itself<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.939> will<00:02:06.030> pick<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
let it go by itself it will pick up a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.380 
let it go by itself it will pick up a
cow<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.849> will<00:02:09.030> kill<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
cow up there and it will kill it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.839 
cow up there and it will kill it
basically<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.310> picked<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
basically as you can see it picked up a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.670 
basically as you can see it picked up a
cow<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.390> dies

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
cow it dies

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.099 
cow it dies
it<00:02:13.739> didn't<00:02:14.099> die<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:15.000> interesting<00:02:15.569> but

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
it didn't die that's interesting but

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.380 
it didn't die that's interesting but
yeah<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.010> cow<00:02:17.189> will<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> loops<00:02:17.969> I<00:02:18.180> guess

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
yeah the cow will do the loops I guess

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.119 
yeah the cow will do the loops I guess
until<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> dies<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.439> at<00:02:19.680> some<00:02:19.799> point<00:02:19.859> it

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
until it dies because at some point it

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.309 
until it dies because at some point it
will<00:02:20.189> die<00:02:20.400> from<00:02:20.579> fall<00:02:20.819> damage<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.019> weird

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
will die from fall damage which is weird

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
will die from fall damage which is weird
that<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.620> didn't<00:02:22.890> die<00:02:23.040> there<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.000> was

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that it didn't die there I think it was

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.440 
that it didn't die there I think it was
because<00:02:24.359> you<00:02:24.750> fell<00:02:25.469> on<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.180> thing<00:02:27.180> but

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
because you fell on like a thing but

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.750 
because you fell on like a thing but
anyway<00:02:27.750> what<00:02:28.379> that's<00:02:29.069> weird<00:02:29.219> I<00:02:29.370> thought<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
anyway what that's weird I thought the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000 
anyway what that's weird I thought the
cows<00:02:29.939> died<00:02:30.239> they<00:02:30.599> should<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:30.959> should<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.349> see

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
cows died they should they should I see

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.770 
cows died they should they should I see
Darrell<00:02:32.219> he<00:02:32.430> takes<00:02:32.639> damage<00:02:32.849> but<00:02:33.420> anyway<00:02:33.659> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
Darrell he takes damage but anyway the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.580 
Darrell he takes damage but anyway the
cow<00:02:35.030> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.180> showed<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.629> what<00:02:37.290> how<00:02:37.530> does

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
cow kind of showed you what how does

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.740 
cow kind of showed you what how does
this<00:02:37.829> may<00:02:38.040> basically<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.480> made<00:02:39.870> by<00:02:40.230> using

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
this may basically it is made by using

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.410 
this may basically it is made by using
by<00:02:42.750> using<00:02:42.989> cows<00:02:43.560> that's<00:02:44.129> about<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.579> how<00:02:45.180> was<00:02:45.389> a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
by using cows that's about it how was a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.409 
by using cows that's about it how was a
lot<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:45.689> cows<00:02:46.040> cows<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> hole<00:02:47.790> if<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> put

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
lot of cows cows in a hole if you put

lot of cows cows in a hole if you put
them<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.720> hole<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.189> they<00:02:50.189> will

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
them in a hole like this they will

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.849 
them in a hole like this they will
basically<00:02:50.549> pop<00:02:50.849> out<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.780> sides<00:02:52.319> as<00:02:52.650> you

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
basically pop out on the sides as you

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.589 
basically pop out on the sides as you
can<00:02:53.069> see<00:02:53.220> right<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.549> which<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.209> beautiful

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
can see right here which is beautiful

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.809 
can see right here which is beautiful

I don't know when but the minecart will
come<00:03:07.290> soon<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:08.189> minecart<00:03:08.849> basically<00:03:09.329> it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
come soon the minecart basically it

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.009 
come soon the minecart basically it
flies<00:03:10.319> against<00:03:10.889> one<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.250> corners<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
flies against one of these corners and

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.440 
flies against one of these corners and
yeah<00:03:13.019> that's<00:03:13.290> about<00:03:13.439> it<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.459> gets<00:03:15.090> pushed

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
back we'll see if the mine cards I don't

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.140 
back we'll see if the mine cards I don't
think<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.709> loaded<00:03:20.159> so<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.400> don't<00:03:20.669> think<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:21.030> oh

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
think it's loaded so I don't think it oh

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.969 
think it's loaded so I don't think it oh
yeah<00:03:21.540> there<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.349> can<00:03:22.530> see<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.799> fall

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
yeah there it is you can see it fall
