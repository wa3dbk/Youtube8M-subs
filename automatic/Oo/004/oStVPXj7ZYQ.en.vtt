control volume an active and a passive

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.630 
control volume an active and a passive
input<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:38.530> depending<00:00:39.100> on<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.340> guitar<00:00:39.610> you

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
input so depending on the guitar you

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.140 
input so depending on the guitar you
have<00:00:40.470> gives<00:00:41.470> you<00:00:41.650> just<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.640> better<00:00:42.820> sound

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
have gives you just a better sound

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.750 
have gives you just a better sound
quality<00:00:43.240> for<00:00:43.810> whichever<00:00:44.110> option<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.890> then

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
quality for whichever option and then

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.440 
quality for whichever option and then
headphone<00:00:46.570> out<00:00:46.720> jack<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:49.080> so<00:00:50.080> this<00:00:51.240> amp<00:00:52.240> is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
headphone out jack so so this amp is

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.030 
headphone out jack so so this amp is
pretty<00:00:52.660> versatile<00:00:53.170> with<00:00:53.410> these<00:00:53.620> different

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
pretty versatile with these different

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.010 
pretty versatile with these different
controls<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.700> with<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.060> graphic<00:00:55.480> equalizer

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
controls and with the graphic equalizer

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.980 
controls and with the graphic equalizer
you<00:00:56.230> can<00:00:57.150> you<00:00:58.150> know<00:00:58.240> get<00:00:58.360> quite<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> bit<00:00:58.900> of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
you can you know get quite a bit of

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.340 
you can you know get quite a bit of
different<00:00:59.290> tonal<00:00:59.590> variances<00:01:00.370> end<00:01:01.200> with<00:01:02.200> this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
different tonal variances end with this

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.039 
different tonal variances end with this
limiter<00:01:02.830> here<00:01:02.860> basically<00:01:03.820> I'll<00:01:04.659> start<00:01:04.930> on

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
limiter here basically I'll start on

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.090 
limiter here basically I'll start on
this<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.869> control<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.350> volume<00:01:08.560> without

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
this you can control the volume without

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
this you can control the volume without
control<00:01:09.729> taking<00:01:10.240> away<00:01:10.450> sound<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.729> right<00:01:12.939> now

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
control taking away sound so right now

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.310 
control taking away sound so right now
it's<00:01:14.350> limited<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:16.299> much<00:01:16.509> sound<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.990> can<00:01:17.140> put

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
it's limited how much sound it can put

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's limited how much sound it can put
out<00:01:17.439> can<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.219> really<00:01:18.460> hear

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.960 

but<00:01:26.260> if<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> exact<00:01:26.830> same<00:01:27.100> sound<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.790> whole

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
but if the exact same sound the whole

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.750 
but if the exact same sound the whole
way

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
way

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.970 
way
as<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.450> goes<00:01:30.570> louder<00:01:30.840> whereas<00:01:31.440> if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> change

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
as it goes louder whereas if you change

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.380 
as it goes louder whereas if you change
the<00:01:32.130> volume

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390 

you<00:01:37.390> end<00:01:37.570> up<00:01:37.690> changing<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.350> little<00:01:38.560> bit<00:01:38.830> more<00:01:39.130> of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
you end up changing a little bit more of

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.200 
you end up changing a little bit more of
how<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.750> sounds<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:42.159> end<00:01:42.310> up<00:01:42.460> with<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.909> little

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
how it sounds you end up with a little

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.760 
how it sounds you end up with a little
bit<00:01:43.390> different<00:01:43.690> tonal<00:01:43.900> variance<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:44.619> you

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
bit different tonal variance as you

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
bit different tonal variance as you
change<00:01:45.040> volume<00:01:45.310> on<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.850> on<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.540> rather<00:01:47.170> than

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
change volume on it on it rather than

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.830 
change volume on it on it rather than
keeping<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.229> all<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.800> same<00:01:51.009> always<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.690> that

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
keeping it all the same always so that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.359 
keeping it all the same always so that
limiter<00:01:53.200> gives<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.649> option<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.250> can

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
limiter gives you that option so you can

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.399 
limiter gives you that option so you can
turn<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.640> down<00:01:54.670> quite<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.090> bit<00:01:55.180> keep<00:01:56.050> all<00:01:56.229> the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
turn it down quite a bit keep all the

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.430 
turn it down quite a bit keep all the
tonal<00:01:56.799> qualities<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.520> want<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:58.540> even<00:01:59.350> if

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
tonal qualities you want so even if

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.649 
tonal qualities you want so even if
you're<00:01:59.619> wanting<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.670> cranked<00:02:01.180> with<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.479> bass

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
you're wanting it cranked with the bass

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
you're wanting it cranked with the bass
and<00:02:02.020> stuff<00:02:02.229> drop<00:02:02.830> out<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.220> EQ<00:02:03.759> or<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.360> trebles

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:22.140 

keep<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.070> at<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> chronic<00:02:14.340> type<00:02:15.340> level

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.910 

right<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.020> it's<00:02:24.800> not<00:02:24.890> way<00:02:25.220> too<00:02:25.280> loud<00:02:26.920> whereas

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
right so it's not way too loud whereas

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.010 
right so it's not way too loud whereas
if<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.280> turn<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.090> down<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.600> still<00:02:29.870> get

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
if you just turn this down you still get

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.950 
if you just turn this down you still get
that<00:02:30.050> same<00:02:30.470> tone

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
and so I'll put that back no ruffle so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.630 
and so I'll put that back no ruffle so
um<00:02:55.300> just<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.260> normal<00:02:56.620> standard<00:02:57.069> setting<00:02:57.489> you

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
um just in a normal standard setting you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.880 
um just in a normal standard setting you
know<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.970> pretty<00:02:58.209> pretty<00:02:58.959> nice<00:02:59.230> sounding

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
know it's a pretty pretty nice sounding

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.680 
know it's a pretty pretty nice sounding
speaker<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.640> they<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.120> here<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.569> it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
speaker that they have in here and it's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.220 
speaker that they have in here and it's
pretty<00:03:02.080> clear<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.860> not<00:03:03.489> God<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:05.170> know<00:03:07.230> it's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
pretty clear it's not God you know it's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.970 
pretty clear it's not God you know it's
not<00:03:08.410> got<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.250> weakness<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.349> sound<00:03:11.650> that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
not got the weakness in the sound that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.400 
not got the weakness in the sound that
some<00:03:12.220> speakers<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.150> mean<00:03:13.330> some<00:03:13.599> some<00:03:14.260> you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
some speakers have I mean some some you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.850 
some speakers have I mean some some you
play<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.099> can<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:17.739> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
play with it and you can just have to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.940 
play with it and you can just have to
