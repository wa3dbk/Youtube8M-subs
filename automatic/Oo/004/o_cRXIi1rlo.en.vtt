top<00:00:05.270> of<00:00:05.450> the<00:00:05.479> head<00:00:05.720> has<00:00:06.080> two<00:00:06.470> bumps<00:00:06.740> these<00:00:07.490> are

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
top of the head has two bumps these are

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.410 
top of the head has two bumps these are
actually<00:00:08.540> part<00:00:09.110> of<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.350> arches<00:00:09.920> over<00:00:10.420> the

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
actually part of the arches over the

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.980 
actually part of the arches over the
eyes<00:00:12.549> continue<00:00:13.549> to<00:00:13.730> make<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.150> face<00:00:14.450> and<00:00:14.780> that

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
eyes continue to make the face and that

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.980 
eyes continue to make the face and that
is<00:00:15.230> going<00:00:15.469> to<00:00:15.620> be<00:00:15.740> a<00:00:15.769> circle

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.099 

now<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.589> ears<00:00:23.890> come<00:00:24.310> out<00:00:24.490> with<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.570> soft

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
now the ears come out with a soft

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:34.880 
now the ears come out with a soft
triangle<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:29.019> smaller<00:00:29.349> one<00:00:29.679> inside

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.189 

they<00:00:35.890> sit<00:00:36.219> kind<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.610> low<00:00:36.760> start<00:00:37.690> in<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.930> center

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
they sit kind of low start in the center

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.780 
they sit kind of low start in the center
of<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.500> face<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.070> make<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.309> straight<00:00:39.730> line

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
of the face and make a straight line

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.610 
of the face and make a straight line
across<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.530> we're<00:00:41.739> going<00:00:41.920> to<00:00:42.010> come<00:00:42.339> down<00:00:42.610> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
across then we're going to come down and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.040 
across then we're going to come down and
angle<00:00:44.620> from<00:00:45.220> both<00:00:45.399> ends<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.120> then<00:00:46.960> we're

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
angle from both ends and then we're

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.930 
angle from both ends and then we're
going<00:00:47.199> to<00:00:47.260> come<00:00:47.530> up<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:52.510> out<00:00:53.339> above<00:00:54.339> that<00:00:54.640> in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
going to come up in out above that in

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.880 
going to come up in out above that in
parallel<00:00:56.370> somewhat<00:00:57.370> parallel<00:00:57.730> I<00:00:58.710> would<00:00:59.710> like

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
parallel somewhat parallel I would like

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.310 
parallel somewhat parallel I would like
the<00:01:00.129> angry<00:01:00.699> eyebrows<00:01:01.300> want<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.960> go<00:01:02.079> straight

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
the angry eyebrows want to go straight

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.820 
the angry eyebrows want to go straight
down<00:01:02.679> and<00:01:02.949> then<00:01:03.670> head<00:01:05.130> across<00:01:07.590> curved<00:01:08.590> line

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
down and then head across curved line

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.459 
down and then head across curved line
there<00:01:10.679> for<00:01:11.679> the<00:01:11.770> eyes

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.889 

we'll<00:01:14.799> make<00:01:14.950> two<00:01:15.250> nostrils<00:01:15.670> we're<00:01:16.659> going<00:01:16.840> to

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
we'll make two nostrils we're going to

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.609 
we'll make two nostrils we're going to
dip<00:01:17.170> down<00:01:17.439> from<00:01:18.070> both<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.729> come<00:01:19.659> across<00:01:20.020> the

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
dip down from both and come across the

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.370 
dip down from both and come across the
jaw<00:01:21.689> let's<00:01:22.689> come<00:01:22.960> out<00:01:23.110> with<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.250> term<00:01:25.170> run<00:01:26.170> it

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
jaw let's come out with a term run it

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.850 
jaw let's come out with a term run it
parallel<00:01:27.340> for<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:27.939> little<00:01:28.240> bit<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.810> then<00:01:29.679> we're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
parallel for a little bit and then we're

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.300 
parallel for a little bit and then we're
going<00:01:29.979> to<00:01:30.039> come<00:01:30.250> up<00:01:30.490> with<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.329> curve<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.590> then

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
going to come up with a curve and then

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.139 
going to come up with a curve and then
we'll<00:01:33.460> match<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.630> other<00:01:34.810> side<00:01:35.610> okay<00:01:36.610> out

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
we'll match that other side okay out

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.139 
we'll match that other side okay out
from<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.960> face<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:40.090> come<00:01:40.270> out<00:01:40.560> with

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
from the face will come out with

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.070 
from the face will come out with
somewhat<00:01:43.149> of<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.420> bump<00:01:45.390> under<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:47.220> jaw

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
somewhat of a bump under the jaw

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.499 
somewhat of a bump under the jaw
we're<00:01:50.080> running<00:01:50.349> a<00:01:50.409> parallel<00:01:50.709> light<00:01:53.399> okay<00:01:54.509> he's

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
we're running a parallel light okay he's

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.199 
we're running a parallel light okay he's
facing<00:01:56.080> us<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:56.500> come<00:01:57.069> off<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.520> middle<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
facing us so come off the middle of the

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.620 
facing us so come off the middle of the
ear<00:01:58.509> with<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.049> slight<00:01:59.530> curve<00:02:00.459> and<00:02:00.939> then<00:02:01.509> we're

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
ear with a slight curve and then we're

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:11.180 
ear with a slight curve and then we're
going<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.899> make<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:05.459> two<00:02:07.380> three<00:02:09.690> loops<00:02:10.690> I'm

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
going to make one two three loops I'm

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.699 
going to make one two three loops I'm
going<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> start<00:02:12.549> into<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.880> circle<00:02:13.500> point<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
going to start into a circle point it

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.930 
going to start into a circle point it
right<00:02:15.010> there<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:16.019> continue<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.230> circle

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
right there and continue that circle

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.090 
right there and continue that circle
there's<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.060> hand<00:02:20.100> let's<00:02:21.100> follow<00:02:21.850> these<00:02:22.299> curves

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
there's a hand let's follow these curves

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.190 
there's a hand let's follow these curves
around

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
around

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.020

three<00:02:34.760> times<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.660> then<00:02:36.260> bring<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:37.070> straight

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
three times and then bring a straight

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.050 
three times and then bring a straight
line<00:02:38.270> down<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.290> chip<00:02:39.560> I'll<00:02:39.860> do<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.760> other

the cell has an edge to it and so let's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.400 
the cell has an edge to it and so let's
follow<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.220> arm<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.819> then<00:02:57.810> come<00:02:58.050> down<00:02:58.080> with

follow the arm and then come down with

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.250 
follow the arm and then come down with
the<00:02:58.530> curve<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.750> then<00:03:00.750> we're<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.020> come
