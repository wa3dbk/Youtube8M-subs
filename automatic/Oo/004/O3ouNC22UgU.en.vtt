00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.090
 files and we give in following these already 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.520
 they are extra programs so we chose the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.520
 second option and uncheck the box 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.770

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.780
 we open it manually 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.110
 now we're going to setup and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.569

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.130

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.130
 finally we close everything 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.860
 We now have the icon in the toolbar 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.750

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.030
