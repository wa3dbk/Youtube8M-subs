00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
in thick woods like this you'll start

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.820 
in thick woods like this you'll start
out<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:05.670> may<00:00:05.819> want<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.259> hang<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.379> tree<00:00:07.680> up

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
out you may want to hang a tree up

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.169 
out you may want to hang a tree up
you're<00:00:08.040> trying<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.370> create<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.670> hole<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
you're trying to create a hole in the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.499 
you're trying to create a hole in the
sky<00:00:09.769> and<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:11.759> room<00:00:11.940> for<00:00:12.120> other<00:00:12.240> trees

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
sky and so you have room for other trees

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.330 
sky and so you have room for other trees
to<00:00:12.630> fall<00:00:12.780> into<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> lot<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:13.950> times<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
to fall into and so a lot of times the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
to fall into and so a lot of times the
first<00:00:14.580> tree<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> cut<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.330> an<00:00:15.450> area<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
first tree I cut in an area is going to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.810 
first tree I cut in an area is going to
get<00:00:16.440> hung<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.340> hung<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.670> up

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
get hung up like this and I hung this up

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
get hung up like this and I hung this up
on<00:00:18.029> purpose<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.779> show<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.100> how<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> cut

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
on purpose just to show you how to cut

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300 
on purpose just to show you how to cut
it<00:00:20.580> back<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.869> way<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.070> put

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it back and the way to do that is to put

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.880 
it back and the way to do that is to put
a<00:00:23.369> cut<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> top<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.140> compression<00:00:25.529> side

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a cut in the top on the compression side

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.099 
a cut in the top on the compression side
and<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:26.760> release<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> tension<00:00:27.930> side

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and then release it on the tension side

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
and then release it on the tension side
when<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.800> release<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.279> back<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
when we release it back in this

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
when we release it back in this
direction<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.510> doesn't<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.080> hung<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> on

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
direction so that doesn't get hung up on

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:57.730 
direction so that doesn't get hung up on
there

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.980 

but<00:00:58.740> by<00:00:58.950> having<00:00:59.310> that<00:00:59.430> hinge<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.120> by<00:01:00.840> not

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
but by having that hinge in there by not

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.960 
but by having that hinge in there by not
cutting<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.650> way<00:01:01.770> through<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
cutting it all the way through it had to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.850 
cutting it all the way through it had to
fold<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.510> hinge<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.320> another

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
fold on the hinge so that's another

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
fold on the hinge so that's another
example<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.400> having<00:01:05.580> holding<00:01:06.060> wood<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
example of having holding wood you

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.790 
example of having holding wood you
always<00:01:06.660> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.870> have<00:01:07.020> holding<00:01:07.440> wood<00:01:07.590> even

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
always want to have holding wood even

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.250 
always want to have holding wood even
when<00:01:08.100> you're<00:01:08.280> cutting<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> horizontal<00:01:09.720> tree

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
when you're cutting at a horizontal tree

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.640 
when you're cutting at a horizontal tree
like<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:02:06.370 

you

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.439 

you
