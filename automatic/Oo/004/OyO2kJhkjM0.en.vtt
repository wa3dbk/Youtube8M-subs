be<00:00:04.860> reviewing<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.520> dual<00:00:05.880> shield<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
be reviewing that dual shield for the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.279 
be reviewing that dual shield for the
Galaxy<00:00:07.710> Nexus<00:00:07.920> um<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:09.150> case<00:00:09.509> was<00:00:09.809> designed

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:10.289 
Galaxy Nexus um this case was designed

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.220 
Galaxy Nexus um this case was designed
by<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.950> sale<00:00:11.339> and<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:12.329> is<00:00:12.480> actually<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.959> two

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
by be on sale and it is actually a two

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
by be on sale and it is actually a two
pieces<00:00:13.650> case<00:00:13.889> now<00:00:14.160> these<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.879> different<00:00:15.089> case

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
pieces case now these are different case

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.679 
pieces case now these are different case
it's<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.900> technically<00:00:16.580> hybrid<00:00:17.580> however<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
it's a technically hybrid however in the

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.040 
it's a technically hybrid however in the
other<00:00:18.900> way<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.619> let<00:00:19.949> me<00:00:19.980> explain<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.609> why<00:00:21.050> that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
other way so let me explain you why that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.259 
other way so let me explain you why that
in<00:00:22.259> their<00:00:22.560> part<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> case<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.550> actually

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
in their part of the case is actually

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.540 
in their part of the case is actually
the<00:00:24.390> plastic<00:00:24.900> part<00:00:24.929> while<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> outer<00:00:25.859> part<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the plastic part while the outer part is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.570 
the plastic part while the outer part is
the<00:00:26.789> silicon<00:00:27.359> now<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.410> our<00:00:28.740> ABS<00:00:29.339> plastic

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the silicon now this is our ABS plastic

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.300 
the silicon now this is our ABS plastic
on<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> inside<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.800> cool<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.070> about

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
on the inside and the cool thing about

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.060 
on the inside and the cool thing about
it<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.879> it<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.450> hole<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.140> here<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
it is that it has the hole right here to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.810 
it is that it has the hole right here to
fit<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.030> GSM<00:00:36.930> Galaxy<00:00:37.620> Nexus<00:00:37.800> right<00:00:38.309> over<00:00:38.550> here

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
fit the GSM Galaxy Nexus right over here

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.779 
fit the GSM Galaxy Nexus right over here
so<00:00:39.420> um<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.140> case<00:00:40.440> does<00:00:40.800> fit<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> Galaxy

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
so um this case does fit the Galaxy

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.319 
so um this case does fit the Galaxy
Nexus<00:00:41.910> LTE<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.289> GSM<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.520> GSM<00:00:45.030> with

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
Nexus LTE and the GSM on the GSM with

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.510 
Nexus LTE and the GSM on the GSM with
the<00:00:45.510> regular<00:00:45.899> battery<00:00:46.320> there's<00:00:46.859> a<00:00:46.949> little<00:00:47.250> gap

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the regular battery there's a little gap

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.479 
the regular battery there's a little gap
of<00:00:47.760> play<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.570> does<00:00:48.629> fit<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.710> does<00:00:49.949> stay<00:00:50.219> there

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of play it does fit it does stay there

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
of play it does fit it does stay there
however<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.750> works<00:00:51.960> better<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
however it works better with the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
however it works better with the
extended<00:00:53.460> battery<00:00:53.519> or<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.570> works<00:00:54.719> better<00:00:54.960> with

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
extended battery or it works better with

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
extended battery or it works better with
the<00:00:55.289> LTE<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.670> let's<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.600> ahead<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> install

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the LTE so let's go ahead and install

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
the LTE so let's go ahead and install
this<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.769> see<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.519> inner<00:01:02.730> part<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this so as you can see the inner part of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.050 
this so as you can see the inner part of
it<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> hard<00:01:03.960> plastic<00:01:04.230> it's<00:01:04.739> abs<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> then

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it is a hard plastic it's abs and then

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.450 
it is a hard plastic it's abs and then
your<00:01:06.360> phone<00:01:06.689> gets<00:01:06.750> placed<00:01:07.680> over<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
your phone gets placed over here and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
your phone gets placed over here and
these<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.820> two<00:01:09.000> piece<00:01:09.240> cases<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.560> you're

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
these are two piece cases so then you're

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
these are two piece cases so then you're
what<00:01:10.920> you're<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.939> put<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
what you're going to do is just put it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.140 
what you're going to do is just put it
in<00:01:12.509> really<00:01:12.840> easy<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.320> put<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.759> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
in really easy to put in and now as you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
in really easy to put in and now as you
can<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:16.170> case<00:01:16.439> there's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
can see over here in the case there's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.969 
can see over here in the case there's
little<00:01:17.369> holes<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:18.509> around<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.229> case<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
little holes all around the case and in

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
little holes all around the case and in
the<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.020> secure

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the back what is this for is to secure

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.069 
the back what is this for is to secure
the<00:01:23.009> silicon<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> over<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
the silicon as you can see over here and

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.800 
the silicon as you can see over here and
as<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> silicon<00:01:27.090> itself<00:01:27.600> as

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
as you can see on the silicon itself as

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.859 
as you can see on the silicon itself as
well<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.490> order<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> mount<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.720> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
well so in order to mount that just as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.649 
well so in order to mount that just as
usual<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> start<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> top<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.659> then

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
usual you start from the top and then

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
usual you start from the top and then
just<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> sides<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:36.680> case<00:01:37.680> stays

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
just put on the sides and the case stays

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.469 
just put on the sides and the case stays
right<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.930> once<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.290> clips<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:42.210> little

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
right there once it clips on the little

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.840 
right there once it clips on the little
holes<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.350> their<00:01:44.009> these<00:01:44.189> guys<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.700> really

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
holes and their these guys are really

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.340 
holes and their these guys are really
good<00:01:45.119> looking<00:01:45.390> case<00:01:45.600> i<00:01:45.780> love<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.079> inner

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
good looking case i love this inner

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
good looking case i love this inner
whiteside<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.460> give<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> phone<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
whiteside on it they give the phone a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.080 
whiteside on it they give the phone a
different<00:01:49.200> look<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:50.159> also<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> see

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
different look and then also if you see

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
different look and then also if you see
from<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> side<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.930> screen<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.409> well

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
from the side the screen is very well

from the side the screen is very well
protected<00:01:53.219> by<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> case<00:01:54.390> itself<00:01:54.930> now<00:01:55.740> from

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
protected by the case itself now from

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
protected by the case itself now from
the<00:01:56.490> bottom<00:01:56.850> part<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> big<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.259> big

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the bottom part you see a big one big

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
the bottom part you see a big one big
cut<00:01:58.860> out<00:01:59.039> over<00:01:59.789> here<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.659> has<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:02.390> charging

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
cut out over here that has the charging

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.620 
cut out over here that has the charging
port<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.229> microphone<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.130> 3.5<00:02:06.000> even

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
port the microphone and the 3.5 even

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.760 
port the microphone and the 3.5 even
though<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.750> looks<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.320> close<00:02:07.590> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
though it looks that it's close this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.500 
though it looks that it's close this
actually<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.250> feels<00:02:08.430> really<00:02:08.760> good<00:02:08.880> now

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
actually it feels really good now

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.260 
actually it feels really good now
remember<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
remember if you

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.540 
remember if you
had<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.840> extended<00:02:11.230> battery<00:02:11.260> all<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.890> LTE<00:02:12.280> all

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
had the extended battery all the LTE all

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.180 
had the extended battery all the LTE all
these<00:02:13.060> will<00:02:13.240> go<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:13.750> higher<00:02:14.050> one<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
these will go a little higher one of the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.560 
these will go a little higher one of the
details<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.880> about<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.270> case<00:02:16.540> is

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
details that I like about this case is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.140 
details that I like about this case is
that<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:17.170> left<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.680> open<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.340> regardless

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
that they left this open and regardless

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.090 
that they left this open and regardless
if<00:02:19.450> you're<00:02:19.630> coming<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.230> new<00:02:20.530> accessory

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
if you're coming with a new accessory

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.610 
if you're coming with a new accessory
for<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.670> iphone<00:02:21.820> or<00:02:22.360> if<00:02:22.840> they're<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.200> at

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
for that iphone or if they're not at

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.500 
for that iphone or if they're not at
least<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.190> chance<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.880> using<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.330> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
least you have the chance of using it so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.940 
least you have the chance of using it so
then<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> case<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.500> fits<00:02:26.710> both

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
then you have a case of fits both

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.490 
then you have a case of fits both
devices<00:02:27.370> now<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.360> silicon<00:02:28.930> buttons<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:29.440> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
devices now the silicon buttons they are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.410 
devices now the silicon buttons they are
really<00:02:29.770> good<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.460> can<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:30.880> they're

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
really good there you can really they're

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.020 
really good there you can really they're
really<00:02:31.630> reactive<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.410> they<00:02:33.100> be<00:02:33.160> press<00:02:33.610> easy

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
really reactive and they be press easy

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.120 
really reactive and they be press easy
outside<00:02:34.690> silicon<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.410> case<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:36.070> actually

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
outside silicon of that case it actually

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.210 
outside silicon of that case it actually
has<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.880> texture<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.780> which<00:02:38.440> are<00:02:38.650> creates<00:02:39.070> a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
has a texture on it which are creates a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.100 
has a texture on it which are creates a
lot<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.430> grip<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.150> lot<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.390> our<00:02:40.840> good

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
lot of grip and a lot of our good

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.260 
lot of grip and a lot of our good
fitment<00:02:41.380> now<00:02:42.130> what<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> like<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.970> most<00:02:43.000> of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
fitment now what I like the most of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.760 
fitment now what I like the most of
these<00:02:43.330> cases<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.750> back<00:02:43.930> look<00:02:44.350> how<00:02:44.470> good<00:02:44.710> it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
these cases the back look how good it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.570 
these cases the back look how good it
looks<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.280> has<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:46.470> non<00:02:47.470> brought<00:02:47.860> in

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
looks it has this little non brought in

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.090 
looks it has this little non brought in
the<00:02:49.150> middle<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.570> case<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.050> not<00:02:50.200> texture<00:02:50.800> so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
the middle of the case is not texture so

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.770 
the middle of the case is not texture so
it's<00:02:51.250> soft<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.030> middle<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.540> hand

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
it's soft for the middle of your hand

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530 
it's soft for the middle of your hand
while<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.620> side<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.160> texture<00:02:54.610> now<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> like

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
while on the side is texture now I like

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.090 
while on the side is texture now I like
this<00:02:55.690> part<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.140> middle<00:02:56.350> looks<00:02:56.590> really

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
this part in the middle looks really

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.620 
this part in the middle looks really
good<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.400> looks<00:02:57.580> different<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.330> what<00:02:58.600> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
good it looks different and I what I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.780 
good it looks different and I what I
found<00:02:58.960> myself<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.920> actually<00:03:00.160> putting<00:03:00.610> my

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
found myself it's actually putting my

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.270 
found myself it's actually putting my
finger<00:03:01.240> on<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.420> pretty<00:03:01.690> quite<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.080> lot<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.950> I'll

finger on it pretty quite a lot so I'll
creating<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.820> little<00:03:04.120> more<00:03:04.300> grip<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.960> it<00:03:04.990> even

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
creating a little more grip on it even

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.740 
creating a little more grip on it even
though<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.070> hard<00:03:06.580> plastic<00:03:07.090> as<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.300> can<00:03:07.510> see

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
though it's hard plastic as you can see

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.500 
though it's hard plastic as you can see
I'm<00:03:08.200> your<00:03:08.980> finger<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.580> top<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.090> creates

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
I'm your finger on the top it creates

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.560 
I'm your finger on the top it creates
some<00:03:10.750> kind<00:03:10.990> of<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.230> grip<00:03:11.710> which<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.070> really<00:03:12.250> like

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
some kind of a grip which I really like

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.330 
some kind of a grip which I really like
button<00:03:13.570> cutouts<00:03:13.960> are<00:03:14.200> perfectly<00:03:14.770> matched<00:03:14.890> as

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
button cutouts are perfectly matched as

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.280 
button cutouts are perfectly matched as
you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.970> see<00:03:16.150> over<00:03:16.270> here<00:03:16.360> look<00:03:16.720> at<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.900> wide

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
you can see over here look at this wide

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.840 
you can see over here look at this wide
look<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.520> in<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.850> camera<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:21.610> speakers

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
look on in the camera the the speakers

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.670 
look on in the camera the the speakers
are<00:03:22.180> really<00:03:22.510> well<00:03:22.660> placed<00:03:22.959> look<00:03:23.260> how<00:03:23.380> good<00:03:23.620> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
are really well placed look how good it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.360 
are really well placed look how good it
looks<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.190> has<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.850> little<00:03:25.380> non<00:03:26.380> broad<00:03:26.770> in

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
looks it has this little non broad in

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.730 
looks it has this little non broad in
the<00:03:27.430> middle<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.480> case<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.959> not<00:03:29.110> textured

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
the middle of the case is not textured

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.680 
the middle of the case is not textured
so<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.160> soft<00:03:30.520> for<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.940> middle<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.300> your<00:03:31.480> hand

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
so it's soft for the middle of your hand

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.440 
so it's soft for the middle of your hand
while<00:03:32.200> on<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.530> side<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:33.070> texture<00:03:33.520> now<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.090> like

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
while on the side is texture now I like

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.000 
while on the side is texture now I like
this<00:03:34.600> part<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.050> middle<00:03:35.260> looks<00:03:35.500> really
