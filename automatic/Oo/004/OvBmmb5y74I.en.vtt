00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.000 
presentation we will prove to you why
this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> true<00:01:06.420> scientifically<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.860> of

this is true scientifically because of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
this is true scientifically because of
simple<00:01:08.220> physics<00:01:08.729> principles<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.869> problem

simple physics principles the problem

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
with all other casting reels is that the

with all other casting reels is that the

opposite of traditional reels and means

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.619 
opposite of traditional reels and means
that<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> line<00:02:29.579> is<00:02:29.730> coming<00:02:30.000> off<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.239> bottom

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
that the line is coming off the bottom

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.479 
that the line is coming off the bottom
of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> spool<00:02:31.079> instead<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> top<00:02:31.829> there

easier motion is less likely to cause a

the able level line system reduces

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.670 
the able level line system reduces

the<00:04:03.989> reason<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.500> if<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.889> backlash<00:04:05.280> begins

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
the reason is that if a backlash begins

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.789 
the reason is that if a backlash begins
the<00:04:06.030> line<00:04:06.209> starts<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.720> bunch<00:04:06.870> up<00:04:07.109> on<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.349> spool

the line starts to bunch up on the spool
just<00:04:08.310> like<00:04:08.430> always<00:04:08.669> however<00:04:09.510> when<00:04:10.049> the
