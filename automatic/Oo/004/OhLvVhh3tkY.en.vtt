00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
three series right now and should be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
three series right now and should be
interesting<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> i<00:00:53.699> assume<00:00:54.300> morale<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
interesting to see I i assume morale is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
interesting to see I i assume morale is
going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> keep<00:00:55.079> its<00:00:55.260> strategy<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
going to keep its strategy up which is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
going to keep its strategy up which is
really<00:00:56.730> tried<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> abuse<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.989> mass<00:00:58.530> Reapers

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

really tried to abuse the mass Reapers
against<00:00:59.609> zerg<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.129> unfortunately

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
against zerg right now and unfortunately

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
against zerg right now and unfortunately
looks<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:02.940> some<00:01:03.090> sort<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> lag

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
looks like there's some sort of lag

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.240 
looks like there's some sort of lag
going<00:01:03.809> down<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:04.680> always<00:01:04.830> seems<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> be

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
going down as there always seems to be

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.789 
going down as there always seems to be
in<00:01:05.489> these<00:01:05.640> weekly<00:01:05.939> cuffs<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
in these weekly cuffs and I'm going to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.010 
in these weekly cuffs and I'm going to
partially<00:01:08.490> blame<00:01:08.700> Blizzard<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.720> but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
partially blame Blizzard for that but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.870 
partially blame Blizzard for that but
I'm<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:10.650> sure<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.490> sometimes

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I'm not actually sure I think sometimes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
I'm not actually sure I think sometimes
that<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.299> are<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.560> observers<00:01:14.040> kind<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that there are the observers kind of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.499

really<00:01:57.450> uses<00:01:57.899> speedlings<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.380> microcosm

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

incredibly well predicts the movement of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
incredibly well predicts the movement of
the<00:02:01.259> Reapers<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.799> he's<00:02:01.920> able<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.490> lot

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the Reapers and he's able to get a lot

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.589 
the Reapers and he's able to get a lot
of<00:02:02.880> surrounds<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:07.879> I'm<00:02:08.879> marilla's<00:02:09.450> now

joking<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:11.360> Merrill<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.450> now<00:02:12.660> joking<00:02:13.290> oh

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
joking with Merrill is now joking oh

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.040 
joking with Merrill is now joking oh
with<00:02:13.890> him<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.370> guess<00:02:14.610> because<00:02:15.480> he<00:02:15.630> doesn't<00:02:15.810> have

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
with him I guess because he doesn't have

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.290 
with him I guess because he doesn't have
to<00:02:16.170> micro<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.100> Reapers<00:02:17.520> although<00:02:17.820> he<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.000> my

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
to micro the Reapers although he is my

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
to micro the Reapers although he is my
crowing<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> speedling<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.200> crazy<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
crowing the speedling it's like crazy to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.150 
crowing the speedling it's like crazy to
to<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:20.760> some<00:02:20.970> damage<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.920> looks<00:02:23.070> like

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
to do some damage and so it looks like

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.430 
to do some damage and so it looks like
yes<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> same<00:02:24.330> thing<00:02:24.630> for

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
yes it's going to be the same thing for

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.990 
yes it's going to be the same thing for
him<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.860> course<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.130> manga<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.760> gaining

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
him of course the manga will be gaining

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.450 
him of course the manga will be gaining
speedlings<00:02:27.540> immediately<00:02:28.280> trying<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> get

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
speedlings immediately trying to get

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.980 
speedlings immediately trying to get
that<00:02:29.550> speed<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:29.910> soon<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.120> 100<00:02:30.510> hits<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
that speed as soon as 100 hits so that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.140 
that speed as soon as 100 hits so that
he<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.350> defend<00:02:31.680> down<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.880> looks<00:02:33.090> like

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
he can defend down and it looks like

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.220 
he can defend down and it looks like
will<00:02:33.510> he<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.810> taking<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.650> expo<00:02:35.370> at<00:02:35.670> 16<00:02:36.600> yes<00:02:37.020> he

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
will he be taking the expo at 16 yes he

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.920 
will he be taking the expo at 16 yes he
will<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.710> as<00:02:37.920> well<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.850> worked<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.630> him<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
will be as well so it worked for him the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.020 
will be as well so it worked for him the
last<00:02:40.080> time<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.680> why<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.430> should<00:02:41.460> work<00:02:41.850> for

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
last time and why not it should work for

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.390 
last time and why not it should work for
him<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.720> time<00:02:42.960> as<00:02:43.200> well<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.770> shall<00:02:44.040> see

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
him this time as well but we shall see

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.270 
him this time as well but we shall see
and<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.360> speed<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.960> nitro<00:02:46.380> gonna<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.710> getting

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
and so speed and nitro gonna be getting

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.630 
and so speed and nitro gonna be getting
down<00:02:47.490> right<00:02:47.550> now<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.360> assume<00:02:48.690> once<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.640> once

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
down right now I assume once that once

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.490 
down right now I assume once that once
that<00:02:50.820> gas<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.360> yeah<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.080> tiny<00:02:52.320> bit

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
that gas is there yeah just a tiny bit

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
that gas is there yeah just a tiny bit
late<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.100> okay<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.580> Meryl<00:02:54.060> is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
late but that's okay because Meryl is

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.640 
late but that's okay because Meryl is
going<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.390> pumping<00:02:54.660> these<00:02:54.780> out<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:55.290> really

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
going to be pumping these out not really

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.360 
going to be pumping these out not really
going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.670> too<00:02:57.120> much<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.870> beginning

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
going to do too much in the beginning

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.620 
going to do too much in the beginning
really<00:02:59.370> wants<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> mass<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.150> until<00:03:00.390> he<00:03:00.540> has

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
really wants to mass up until he has

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.330 
really wants to mass up until he has
about<00:03:00.840> two<00:03:01.350> or<00:03:01.500> three<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.830> them<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.130> first

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
about two or three of them the first

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.100 
about two or three of them the first

true<00:03:42.240> nerf<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.230> Reapers<00:03:43.620> are<00:03:43.770> but<00:03:44.100> you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
true nerf to the Reapers are but you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.620 
true nerf to the Reapers are but you
know<00:03:44.520> Blizzard<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.090> it's<00:03:45.180> paying<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.480> lot

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
know Blizzard I think it's paying a lot

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.120 
know Blizzard I think it's paying a lot
of<00:03:45.750> attention<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.170> Reapers<00:03:46.620> are<00:03:46.740> just<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
of attention that Reapers are just a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.830 
of attention that Reapers are just a
little<00:03:47.490> bit<00:03:47.610> too<00:03:47.760> much<00:03:47.910> once<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.330> master<00:03:48.750> them

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
little bit too much once you master them

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.590 
little bit too much once you master them
in<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.170> early<00:03:49.470> game<00:03:50.150> Reapers<00:03:51.150> didn't<00:03:51.510> get

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
in the early game Reapers didn't get

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.020 
in the early game Reapers didn't get
very<00:03:51.720> much<00:03:51.900> attention<00:03:52.350> until<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.490> launch<00:03:53.730> one

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
very much attention until the launch one

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.660 
very much attention until the launch one
I<00:03:54.060> think<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.630> was<00:03:54.810> LZ<00:03:55.260> gamer<00:03:55.560> who<00:03:56.340> I'm<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.610> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
I think it was LZ gamer who I'm going to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.790 
I think it was LZ gamer who I'm going to
try<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.790> give<00:03:56.970> credit<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.350> things<00:03:58.350> are<00:03:58.500> trying

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
try to give credit to things are trying

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.350 
try to give credit to things are trying

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
to attack not a very good idea as once

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.699 
to attack not a very good idea as once
the<00:04:00.450> Reapers<00:04:00.660> hop<00:04:00.780> onto<00:04:00.959> their<00:04:01.230> they<00:04:01.380> can<00:04:01.440> fire

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
the Reapers hop onto their they can fire

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.920 
the Reapers hop onto their they can fire
back<00:04:01.980> down<00:04:02.190> at<00:04:02.430> them<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.090> free<00:04:03.330> shots<00:04:03.570> for<00:04:03.900> the

back down at them so free shots for the
Reapers<00:04:04.350> not<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.010> best<00:04:05.100> position<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:05.550> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
down then things might backfire over

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.400 
down then things might backfire over
unfortunately<00:04:28.860> as<00:04:29.040> as<00:04:29.280> muro<00:04:30.090> tomorrow<00:04:30.870> we'll

unfortunately as as muro tomorrow we'll

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.410 
unfortunately as as muro tomorrow we'll
have<00:04:31.500> established<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:32.160> very<00:04:32.370> good<00:04:32.610> economic

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
have established a very good economic

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.180 
have established a very good economic
advantage<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.200> maca<00:04:34.440> right<00:04:34.650> now<00:04:34.770> trying<00:04:35.070> is

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
advantage the maca right now trying is

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.400 
advantage the maca right now trying is
very<00:04:35.370> best<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.730> predict<00:04:36.210> where<00:04:36.480> these<00:04:36.690> Reapers

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
very best to predict where these Reapers

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.130 
very best to predict where these Reapers
are<00:04:37.560> going<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:38.100> attack<00:04:38.750> trying<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.810> get<00:04:39.930> down

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
are going to attack trying to get down

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.170 
are going to attack trying to get down
and<00:04:40.440> have<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.040> few<00:04:41.310> links<00:04:41.550> here<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.030> there

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
and have a few links here and there

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.670 
and have a few links here and there
looks<00:04:42.570> like<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.870> will<00:04:43.050> be<00:04:43.140> forced<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.530> be

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
looks like you will be forced to be

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.960 
looks like you will be forced to be
throwing<00:04:43.950> down<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.100> spine<00:04:44.400> crawl<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.700> this<00:04:44.820> game

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
throwing down a spine crawl in this game

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.060 
throwing down a spine crawl in this game
this<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.270> very<00:04:45.510> good<00:04:45.570> position<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
this is a very good position for the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.890 
this is a very good position for the
spine<00:04:47.220> crawler<00:04:47.520> as<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:47.940> does<00:04:48.120> kind<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.480> prevent

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
spine crawler as it does kind of prevent

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.810 
spine crawler as it does kind of prevent
anything<00:04:49.320> from<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.800> cliff<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.190> attacking<00:04:50.520> and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
anything from the cliff on attacking and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.640 
anything from the cliff on attacking and
i<00:04:51.120> think<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.630> range<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.440> spine

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
i think that the range of the spine

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.770 
i think that the range of the spine
crawler<00:04:52.920> will<00:04:53.370> actually<00:04:53.670> allow<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.970> poke<00:04:54.540> down

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
crawler will actually allow to poke down

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.650 
crawler will actually allow to poke down
here<00:04:55.320> as<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:56.100> Overlord<00:04:56.910> is<00:04:57.060> giving<00:04:57.450> sight

here as the Overlord is giving sight

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
there as well so dhamaka definitely well

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.710

ever more difficult to defend against

a very effective and it looks like the

a very effective and it looks like the
market<00:06:01.980> right<00:06:02.100> now<00:06:02.130> is<00:06:02.430> about<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.210> pump<00:06:03.540> up<00:06:03.630> his

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
will they he does see that the Overlord

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.580 
will they he does see that the Overlord
is<00:06:08.190> there<00:06:08.400> already<00:06:08.730> vomiting<00:06:09.270> creep<00:06:09.600> note

that<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.800> layer<00:06:11.070> is<00:06:11.250> down<00:06:11.490> so<00:06:11.700> that<00:06:11.730> his

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
that the layer is down so that his

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.750 
that the layer is down so that his
window<00:06:12.450> to<00:06:12.510> attack<00:06:12.900> is<00:06:13.080> now<00:06:13.200> very<00:06:13.500> small<00:06:14.040> as<00:06:14.280> as

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
window to attack is now very small as as

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.450 
window to attack is now very small as as
soon<00:06:14.910> as<00:06:15.060> that<00:06:15.150> spire<00:06:15.450> finishes<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.980> while<00:06:17.250> it

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
soon as that spire finishes and while it

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.310 
soon as that spire finishes and while it
looks<00:06:17.730> like<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.780> Mach<00:06:18.930> is<00:06:19.080> going<00:06:19.200> to<00:06:19.260> be

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
looks like the Mach is going to be

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.360 
looks like the Mach is going to be
changing<00:06:19.620> things<00:06:19.800> up<00:06:19.890> just<00:06:20.040> a<00:06:20.160> little<00:06:20.280> bit

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
changing things up just a little bit

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.800 
changing things up just a little bit
beliefs<00:06:20.790> are<00:06:20.970> going<00:06:21.210> for<00:06:21.360> this<00:06:21.419> around<00:06:21.600> right

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
beliefs are going for this around right

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.500 
beliefs are going for this around right
now<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.169> able<00:06:22.710> to<00:06:22.860> choke<00:06:23.190> off<00:06:23.310> a<00:06:23.370> bunch<00:06:24.030> of<00:06:24.240> the

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
now and able to choke off a bunch of the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.570 
now and able to choke off a bunch of the
other<00:06:25.050> Reapers<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.590> just<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:25.890> ton<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.280> things

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
other Reapers and just a ton of things

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.700 
other Reapers and just a ton of things
to<00:06:26.730> maaga<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.300> think<00:06:27.690> Merle<00:06:27.870> was<00:06:27.960> not<00:06:28.260> expecting

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
to maaga I think Merle was not expecting

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.590 
to maaga I think Merle was not expecting
that<00:06:28.740> many<00:06:29.220> links<00:06:29.490> from<00:06:29.940> his<00:06:30.090> opponent<00:06:30.480> right

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
that many links from his opponent right

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.090 
that many links from his opponent right
now<00:06:30.720> but<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.110> looks<00:06:31.290> like<00:06:31.440> there<00:06:31.590> are<00:06:31.620> can<00:06:31.980> be

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
now but it looks like there are can be

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.310 
now but it looks like there are can be
roaches<00:06:32.430> out<00:06:32.820> right<00:06:33.030> now<00:06:33.210> so<00:06:33.750> not<00:06:33.930> going<00:06:34.140> to<00:06:34.200> go

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
roaches out right now so not going to go

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.200 
roaches out right now so not going to go
with<00:06:34.470> the<00:06:34.650> muta<00:06:35.220> link<00:06:35.400> combination<00:06:35.880> that<00:06:36.000> he

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
with the muta link combination that he

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.540 
with the muta link combination that he
went<00:06:36.390> with<00:06:36.630> before<00:06:37.169> and<00:06:37.710> trying<00:06:38.250> to<00:06:38.310> get<00:06:38.430> some

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
went with before and trying to get some

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.820 
went with before and trying to get some
roaches<00:06:38.760> out<00:06:39.000> maybe<00:06:39.270> because<00:06:39.660> he

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
roaches out maybe because he

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.310 
roaches out maybe because he
felt<00:06:39.980> like<00:06:40.100> he<00:06:40.190> was<00:06:40.310> a<00:06:40.340> little<00:06:40.580> bit<00:06:40.670> behind<00:06:41.320> in

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
felt like he was a little bit behind in

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.380 
felt like he was a little bit behind in
terms<00:06:42.860> of<00:06:43.040> gas<00:06:43.250> really<00:06:43.670> hasn't<00:06:43.820> been<00:06:43.940> able<00:06:44.120> to

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
terms of gas really hasn't been able to

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.300

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
mine at the expansion yet yeah and

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.730 
mine at the expansion yet yeah and
really<00:06:46.520> hasn't<00:06:46.760> gotten<00:06:47.090> much<00:06:47.690> gas<00:06:48.020> at<00:06:48.290> also

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740

might<00:06:49.490> have<00:06:49.730> been<00:06:49.940> holding<00:06:50.600> out<00:06:50.660> just<00:06:50.900> a

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
might have been holding out just a

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.110 
might have been holding out just a
little<00:06:51.020> bit<00:06:51.350> or<00:06:51.650> maybe<00:06:51.680> he<00:06:52.220> thought<00:06:52.430> that<00:06:52.670> with

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
little bit or maybe he thought that with

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.370 
little bit or maybe he thought that with
that<00:06:53.360> many<00:06:53.600> Reapers<00:06:53.840> on<00:06:53.960> the<00:06:54.020> boy<00:06:54.110> he<00:06:54.230> actually

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
that many Reapers on the boy he actually

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.830 
that many Reapers on the boy he actually
doesn't<00:06:54.680> have<00:06:54.890> a<00:06:54.920> spire<00:06:55.310> yet<00:06:55.640> even<00:06:55.940> so<00:06:56.390> opted

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
doesn't have a spire yet even so opted

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.960 
doesn't have a spire yet even so opted
for<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.140> road<00:06:58.070> warren<00:06:58.370> which<00:06:58.490> is<00:06:58.610> a<00:06:58.640> little

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
for the road warren which is a little

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.940 
for the road warren which is a little
bit<00:06:59.060> of<00:06:59.150> a<00:06:59.210> change<00:06:59.420> of<00:06:59.570> pace<00:06:59.750> speed<00:07:00.560> about<00:07:00.770> to

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
bit of a change of pace speed about to

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.670 
bit of a change of pace speed about to
be<00:07:01.070> finished<00:07:01.730> for<00:07:02.000> them<00:07:02.450> the<00:07:03.110> glial

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
be finished for them the glial

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.310 
be finished for them the glial
reconstitution<00:07:04.610> finished<00:07:05.420> for<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:05.780> roaches

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
reconstitution finished for the roaches

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.750 
reconstitution finished for the roaches
so<00:07:06.470> they<00:07:06.590> should<00:07:06.770> be<00:07:06.860> that<00:07:07.070> much<00:07:07.280> better<00:07:07.460> at

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
so they should be that much better at

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.430 
so they should be that much better at
defending<00:07:07.940> right<00:07:08.390> now<00:07:08.570> against<00:07:09.320> these

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
defending right now against these

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.840 
defending right now against these
Reapers<00:07:09.710> these<00:07:09.890> Reapers<00:07:10.100> can't<00:07:10.460> really<00:07:10.700> come

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.390 
up here I don't really want to come up
there<00:07:12.110> because<00:07:12.470> they<00:07:12.680> would<00:07:12.800> be<00:07:12.890> getting<00:07:13.160> free
