bourbon<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:13.220> 1997<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> Archimedes

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.999 

one<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> advantages<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.530> game<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
one of the advantages of this game is

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.410 
one of the advantages of this game is
that<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.280> shows<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.090> power<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that it shows the power of the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.419 
that it shows the power of the
Archimedes<00:01:22.020> because<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.679> look<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
Archimedes because if you look on that a

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.539 
Archimedes because if you look on that a
utopia<00:01:24.179> there's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.840> link<00:01:25.020> below<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.429> was

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
utopia there's a link below and that was

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.999 
utopia there's a link below and that was
take<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> video<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.689> compares<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
take you to a video which compares the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.520 
take you to a video which compares the
Archimedes<00:01:29.850> version<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> arch<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
Archimedes version of arch with the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.190 
Archimedes version of arch with the
Atari<00:01:31.859> ST<00:01:32.100> duration<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> arch<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
Atari ST duration of arch so you just

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.739 
Atari ST duration of arch so you just
see<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.280> difference<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.850> power<00:01:36.090> between<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
see the difference in power between the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:42.889 
see the difference in power between the
two<00:01:37.049> systems<00:01:39.560> now<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.280> game<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.969> quite<00:01:42.630> unique

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
two systems now the game is quite unique

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.550 
two systems now the game is quite unique
and<00:01:43.219> very<00:01:44.219> difficult<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.090> difficult<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and very difficult very difficult to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
and very difficult very difficult to
control<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.399> shoot<00:01:47.579> anything<00:01:47.850> takes<00:01:48.479> our

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
control and to shoot anything takes our

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.950 
control and to shoot anything takes our
one<00:01:48.899> practice<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.890> learn<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.429> fly<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.960> because

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
one practice to learn to fly it because

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.679 
one practice to learn to fly it because
it's<00:01:52.350> basically<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:53.640> thrusting<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.569> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it's basically that thrusting if you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.200 
it's basically that thrusting if you
have<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.409> craft<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.859> it<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.340> very

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
have to do with the craft and it is very

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.419 
have to do with the craft and it is very
difficult<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.929> what<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.109> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.590> first

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
difficult so what I'm going to do first

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.649 
difficult so what I'm going to do first
of<00:01:59.549> all<00:01:59.579> i'm<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> show<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.240> me

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
of all i'm going to show you me

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289 
of all i'm going to show you me
attempting<00:02:01.319> to<00:02:01.439> play<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.729> even

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
attempting to play it and just even

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.450 
attempting to play it and just even
after<00:02:03.719> quite<00:02:04.139> a<00:02:04.170> while<00:02:04.439> practicing<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.219> still

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
after quite a while practicing is still

flying<00:05:13.050> look<00:05:13.410> at<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.560> speed<00:05:13.950> of<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.220> ground

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
flying look at the speed of the ground

flying look at the speed of the ground
there<00:05:14.640> how<00:05:14.820> smooth<00:05:15.270> this<00:05:15.450> is<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:16.230> if<00:05:16.350> you

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
there how smooth this is and if you

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.650 
there how smooth this is and if you
compare<00:05:16.950> this<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.670> Atari<00:05:18.570> ST<00:05:20.330> version<00:05:21.330> the

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
compare this to the Atari ST version the

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.420 
compare this to the Atari ST version the
link<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:22.020> down<00:05:22.200> below<00:05:22.260> you'll<00:05:22.830> see<00:05:23.840> difference

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
link is down below you'll see difference

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:33.200 
link is down below you'll see difference
involved<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.230> also<00:05:31.320> see<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:32.210> whether

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
involved and you also see it whether

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.720 
involved and you also see it whether
this<00:05:33.570> is<00:05:33.870> much<00:05:34.110> better<00:05:34.440> than<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:35.100> am<00:05:35.250> much<00:05:35.550> more

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
this is much better than I am much more

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.960 
this is much better than I am much more
practice<00:05:36.180> was<00:05:36.570> what<00:05:36.780> doing<00:05:37.080> on<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.440> screen

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
practice was what doing on the screen

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.800 
practice was what doing on the screen
especially<00:05:38.970> when<00:05:39.030> you<00:05:39.210> think<00:05:39.510> that<00:05:39.690> the

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
especially when you think that the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.750 
especially when you think that the
operators<00:05:40.320> is<00:05:40.500> about<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.890> equivalent<00:05:41.340> over

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
operators is about the equivalent over

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.680 
operators is about the equivalent over
38<00:05:42.890> 625<00:05:43.890> so<00:05:44.450> there<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:45.540> go<00:05:45.570> that's<00:05:46.500> as<00:05:46.950> arch

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
38 625 so there you go that's as arch

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:54.680 
38 625 so there you go that's as arch
