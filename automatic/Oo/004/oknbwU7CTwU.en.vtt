00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 hi everyone today small 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.429
 video for you can review how 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.410
 change it's ps2 joystick joystick 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:18.210
 so that's all that so you need some 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.619
 christi crimes down you take from a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 other planet I had an old 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 little trunk that I'm going to recover 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.779
 so here we are I'm going to do a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779
 small focus 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.620
 or else they were worth something 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 for matt editing how do you hear 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.780
 I already have behind her the joystick 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.020
 to go lower for them and they will 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 do a little Phillips screwdriver so 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 it's all that you lives so it's 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.360
 I'm already doing so so here I go 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 will do the tuning after having 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:09.689
 unscrewed for music not or you 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:15.270
 you end up with this you see 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:19.500
 your little one was waiting for a small screw 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.570
 just there that still needs to be unscrewed so 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.460
 just waiting for people full of better 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.460
 so where did he start 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 so not 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:51.030
 photo cl to m in what you have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 chosen to try 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.860
 it exists because I believe it's 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 not the same raise but you do not know if 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.900
 it's not the same you to be able to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.280
 lose is easy so you take 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:09.030
 joystiq that you want to change so 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.440
 to remove it so to change the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.590
 joystick 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.500
 that's all that so it looks like that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.420
 this is how it will be but here 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.209
 you're shredded so I'm going to take 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.430
 which wants to continue to attract as much 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:30.360
 of success that you see yourself well 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 falling shot is like that at the end and in 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.690
 done that's how it is a little everything 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.770
 like that he keeps inside that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 the thing like that if you'll see well 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.420
 so here's an ad to put it back 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.690
 it's very simple by you put the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.440
 two well in front and small 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.100
 rectangles one in front then it's good 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.760
 so for me was the games stick 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.940
 as should be in the back in turn the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.870
 up 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:14.940
 take transfer focus 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:20.690
 just lice museum and that's it so you 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.690
 take the screw to screw 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:35.129
 I'm falling starts like this rest 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:41.200
 So here you go again at home 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:47.280
 I hope you 'll see well so 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.280
 revised well so with limited evidence 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:57.489
 to engage is worth the briefcase 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:01.060
