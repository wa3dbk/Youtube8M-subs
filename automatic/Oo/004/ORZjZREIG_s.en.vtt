00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.590 

so<00:01:05.480> let's<00:01:06.170> take<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> look<00:01:06.590> at<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.830> first<00:01:07.100> line

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
so let's take a look at the first line

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.810 
so let's take a look at the first line
which<00:01:08.600> goes<00:01:08.840> cycles<00:01:09.320> through<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.500> g7<00:01:09.950> C<00:01:10.460> seventh

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
which goes cycles through a g7 C seventh

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.040 
which goes cycles through a g7 C seventh
and<00:01:10.940> an<00:01:11.030> F<00:01:11.210> arpeggio<00:01:11.630> let<00:01:12.410> me<00:01:12.500> play<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:17.050> it's

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
and an F arpeggio let me play that it's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.820 
and an F arpeggio let me play that it's
that<00:01:18.200> much<00:01:18.470> okay<00:01:19.090> now<00:01:20.530> every<00:01:21.530> one<00:01:21.680> of<00:01:21.710> these

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
that much okay now every one of these

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.230 
that much okay now every one of these
notes<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.400> could<00:01:22.490> be<00:01:22.550> a<00:01:22.670> note<00:01:22.910> in<00:01:23.120> the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
notes is and could be a note in the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.170 
notes is and could be a note in the
arpeggio<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.410> it's<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.830> basic<00:01:25.280> outline<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
arpeggio but it's a basic outline of the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.940 
arpeggio but it's a basic outline of the
arpeggio<00:01:26.510> or<00:01:26.870> something<00:01:27.470> close<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:27.920> or

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
arpeggio or something close to that or

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.700 
arpeggio or something close to that or
pay<00:01:28.190> show<00:01:28.370> but<00:01:28.880> anyway<00:01:29.410> let's<00:01:30.410> go<00:01:30.500> ahead<00:01:30.560> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
pay show but anyway let's go ahead and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.440 
pay show but anyway let's go ahead and
play<00:01:30.830> through<00:01:31.010> that<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.370> first<00:01:31.640> three<00:01:32.300> notes

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
play through that the first three notes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.190 
play through that the first three notes
or<00:01:32.750> just<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.050> pickup<00:01:33.350> notes<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.960> for<00:01:35.960> draw

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
for Bend for blow so let's try that slow

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.140 
for Bend for blow so let's try that slow
I'm<00:01:39.950> gonna<00:01:40.100> turn<00:01:40.369> on<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.580> little<00:01:40.729> metronome

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
I'm gonna turn on a little metronome

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.560 
I'm gonna turn on a little metronome
here<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.990> about<00:01:42.200> 50<00:01:42.530> beats<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.729> we'll<00:01:44.330> play<00:01:44.479> it

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
here in about 50 beats and we'll play it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:59.219 
here in about 50 beats and we'll play it
along<00:01:44.750> with<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:46.720> one<00:01:47.950> two<00:01:49.150> three

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:14.890 

let's<00:02:00.229> try<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.439> again<00:02:01.000> one<00:02:02.229> two<00:02:03.430> three<00:02:13.900> all

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
let's try that again one two three all

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:30.220 
let's try that again one two three all
right<00:02:15.110> one<00:02:15.380> more<00:02:15.560> time<00:02:16.630> one<00:02:17.630> two<00:02:19.000> three<00:02:29.230> all

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
right one more time one two three all

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.410 
right one more time one two three all
right<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.220> go<00:02:31.340> through<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> few<00:02:31.819> times<00:02:31.970> if

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
right so go through that a few times if

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.960 
right so go through that a few times if
you<00:02:32.510> need<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.810> stop<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.500> tape<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.550> go<00:02:34.790> through

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
you need to stop the tape and go through

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.280 
you need to stop the tape and go through
that<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.390> then<00:02:35.569> let's<00:02:35.810> move<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
that and then let's move on to the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.309 
that and then let's move on to the
second<00:02:36.709> line<00:02:36.970> next

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319
