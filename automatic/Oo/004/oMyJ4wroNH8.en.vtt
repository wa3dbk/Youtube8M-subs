first<00:00:25.560> thing<00:00:25.710> we'll<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:25.949> flip<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> over

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
upside down and the first step in

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.700 
upside down and the first step in
getting<00:00:30.119> any<00:00:30.510> keyboard<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> ThinkPad<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
getting any keyboard off the ThinkPad is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.340

it's<00:00:34.350> dust<00:00:34.680> off<00:00:36.559> when<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.770> first<00:00:37.950> trying

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it's dust off when I was first trying

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.440 
it's dust off when I was first trying
this<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.700> surprised<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.120> learn<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.390> are

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this I was surprised to learn there are

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
this I was surprised to learn there are
only<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.840> screws<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.500> model<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.129> hold

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
only two screws on this model that hold

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
only two screws on this model that hold
the<00:00:41.399> keyboard<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.850> place<00:00:42.200> I<00:00:43.200> initially

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the keyboard in place I initially

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
the keyboard in place I initially
started<00:00:43.980> removing<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:44.760> these<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.090> screws

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
started removing all these little screws

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.119 
started removing all these little screws
you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.960> there's<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.170> there<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.890> there

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you can see there's one there and there

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
you can see there's one there and there
a<00:00:47.520> couple<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.570> over<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> place<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.230> removed

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a couple all over the place I removed

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040 
a couple all over the place I removed
all<00:00:49.559> those<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> only<00:00:51.329> turns<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.660> only<00:00:51.870> two

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
all those and it only turns out only two

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.209 
all those and it only turns out only two
of<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.590> held<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> keyboard<00:00:53.129> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of them actually held the keyboard in

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.500 
of them actually held the keyboard in
place<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.879> gonna<00:00:53.969> show<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> those

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
place so I'm just gonna show you those

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.250 
place so I'm just gonna show you those
two<00:00:55.579> another<00:00:56.579> common<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.600> there's<00:00:57.960> my<00:00:58.079> line

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
two another common thing there's my line

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.540 
two another common thing there's my line
of<00:00:58.379> thinking<00:00:58.530> anyways<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> saw<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> little

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
of thinking anyways I saw this little

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
of thinking anyways I saw this little
keyboard<00:00:59.760> icon<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.170> pad

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
keyboard icon there which on a think pad

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
keyboard icon there which on a think pad
generally<00:01:01.710> indicates<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.550> where<00:01:02.940> if

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
generally indicates that that's where if

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.469 
generally indicates that that's where if
a<00:01:03.390> keyboard<00:01:03.930> screw<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> mistakenly

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
a keyboard screw is and so I mistakenly

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.960 
a keyboard screw is and so I mistakenly
took<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.930> screw<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:08.340> actually<00:01:08.850> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
took that screw out when actually it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.280 
took that screw out when actually it's
referring<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.840> hole<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
referring to this little hole in the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.250 
referring to this little hole in the
bottom<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> drainage<00:01:11.670> port

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
bottom here which is the drainage port

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.690 
bottom here which is the drainage port
this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> made<00:01:13.619> obvious<00:01:13.979> by<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.490> drop

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
this is made obvious by that little drop

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
this is made obvious by that little drop
of<00:01:14.880> water<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
of water there and what that is is the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.760 
of water there and what that is is the
keyboard<00:01:18.090> has<00:01:18.270> channels<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
keyboard has channels in it where if you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
keyboard has channels in it where if you
spill<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.490> coke<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.030> some<00:01:21.270> water<00:01:21.479> or

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
spill a can of coke or some water or

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350 
spill a can of coke or some water or
coffee<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> liquid<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.909> actually

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
coffee on it the liquid is actually

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.730 
coffee on it the liquid is actually
drawn<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> these<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.290> ports<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
drawn to these little ports on the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.649 
drawn to these little ports on the
bottom<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.189> drain<00:01:26.430> safely<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:27.090> instead<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
bottom and drain safely out instead of

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
bottom and drain safely out instead of
getting<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.619> motherboard<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.220> screwing

first steps let's get this cover up I'm

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.389 
first steps let's get this cover up I'm
just<00:02:01.110> using<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.439> standard<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:02.100> mini

model<00:02:32.320> with<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> bluetooth<00:02:33.040> option<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:33.880> I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
model with the bluetooth option then I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
model with the bluetooth option then I
believe<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.600> card<00:02:34.840> would<00:02:34.960> be<00:02:35.020> inserted<00:02:35.560> here

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
believe that card would be inserted here

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.370 
believe that card would be inserted here
I<00:02:36.130> however<00:02:37.060> did<00:02:37.360> not<00:02:37.420> order<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.810> option<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.260> I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
I however did not order that option so I

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.200 
I however did not order that option so I
can't<00:02:38.650> confirm<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.070> if<00:02:39.790> somebody<00:02:40.090> else

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
can't confirm that if somebody else

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.820 
can't confirm that if somebody else

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.910 
right there is where you want to insert
your<00:03:35.220> screwdriver<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.760> just<00:03:35.820> gently<00:03:36.180> pry<00:03:36.630> up

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
your screwdriver and just gently pry up

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.330 
your screwdriver and just gently pry up
so<00:03:37.920> we'll<00:03:38.010> go<00:03:38.100> ahead<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:40.250> see<00:03:41.250> it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so we'll go ahead and do that you see it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.310 
so we'll go ahead and do that you see it
kind<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.610> pop<00:03:41.790> out<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> place<00:03:42.120> don't<00:03:42.780> force<00:03:43.110> it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
kind of pop out of place don't force it

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.020 
kind of pop out of place don't force it
let's<00:03:44.040> go<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> other<00:03:44.520> side<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.970> do

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
let's go over to the other side and do

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.550 
let's go over to the other side and do
the<00:03:45.060> same<00:03:45.360> thing<00:03:45.600> when<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.840> other<00:03:45.990> notch<00:03:48.560> all

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the same thing when the other notch all

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.240 
the same thing when the other notch all
right<00:03:50.150> now<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.210> just<00:03:51.540> kind<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.590> push<00:03:52.830> forward

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
right now we just kind of push forward

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.960 
right now we just kind of push forward
gently<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.120> pops<00:03:54.720> up<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.770> should<00:03:56.040> see

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
gently so it pops up and you should see

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.520 
gently so it pops up and you should see
the<00:03:57.090> whole<00:03:57.210> keyboard<00:03:57.420> lift<00:03:57.990> up<00:03:58.170> there<00:03:58.380> then

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the whole keyboard lift up there then

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.890 
the whole keyboard lift up there then
you<00:03:58.590> can<00:03:58.620> gently<00:03:59.250> pull<00:03:59.520> back<00:03:59.550> and<00:04:00.620> voila<00:04:02.900> you

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
you can gently pull back and voila you

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.360 
you can gently pull back and voila you
can<00:04:04.050> just<00:04:04.230> put<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.500> right<00:04:04.530> there<00:04:04.680> for<00:04:04.860> now

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
can just put it right there for now

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.180 
can just put it right there for now
and<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.620> inside<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.489> t4<00:04:09.060> 10<00:04:10.190> right

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and this is the inside of a t4 10 right

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.890 
and this is the inside of a t4 10 right
here<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.610> have<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> little<00:04:12.060> roll<00:04:12.600> cage

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
here we have a little roll cage

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.479 
here we have a little roll cage
protecting<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.620> optical<00:04:14.250> drive<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:16.489> guess

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
protecting the optical drive I guess

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.800 
protecting the optical drive I guess
it's<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.730> fairly<00:04:17.940> sturdy<00:04:18.209> if<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.480> put<00:04:18.660> pressure

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
it's a fairly sturdy if I put pressure

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.539 
it's a fairly sturdy if I put pressure
on<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.470> definitely<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:19.950> moving<00:04:20.400> and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
on it I can definitely see it moving and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.430 
on it I can definitely see it moving and
precious<00:04:21.330> into<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.660> optical<00:04:22.020> drive<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.380> it

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
precious into the optical drive but it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.870 
precious into the optical drive but it
would<00:04:22.560> take<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.740> lot<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.040> force<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.550> actually<00:04:23.640> go

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
would take a lot of force to actually go

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.350 
would take a lot of force to actually go
in<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.060> damage<00:04:24.419> something<00:04:26.030> under<00:04:27.030> here<00:04:27.270> we

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
in and damage something under here we

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.670 
in and damage something under here we
have<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.480> little<00:04:27.630> black<00:04:27.900> plastic<00:04:28.380> flap<00:04:28.650> that

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
covers up the second memory thing this

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.210 
covers up the second memory thing this
is<00:04:31.260> also<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.530> 2<00:04:31.770> gigabyte<00:04:32.040> ddr3<00:04:32.880> so-dimm<00:04:34.220> right

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
is also a 2 gigabyte ddr3 so-dimm right

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.040 
is also a 2 gigabyte ddr3 so-dimm right
here<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.580> where<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.760> keyboard<00:04:36.000> plugs<00:04:36.570> in<00:04:36.810> I

here is where the keyboard plugs in I

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.810 
here is where the keyboard plugs in I
can<00:04:37.260> actually<00:04:37.500> go<00:04:37.590> ahead<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:38.100> won't<00:04:38.550> remove

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
can actually go ahead and I won't remove

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.920 
can actually go ahead and I won't remove
it<00:04:38.970> for<00:04:39.090> now<00:04:39.210> since<00:04:39.390> it's<00:04:39.570> not<00:04:39.660> hurting

it for now since it's not hurting

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930 
it for now since it's not hurting
anything<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:40.470> you<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.190> simply<00:04:41.460> pry<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.880> up

anything but you just simply pry that up

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.520 
anything but you just simply pry that up
and<00:04:42.240> your<00:04:42.480> whole<00:04:42.660> keyboard<00:04:43.050> will<00:04:43.140> just<00:04:43.260> simply

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
and your whole keyboard will just simply

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.600 
and your whole keyboard will just simply
pop<00:04:43.710> off<00:04:45.500> moving<00:04:46.500> over<00:04:46.680> here<00:04:46.710> we<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.250> the

of the keyboard lenovo does like to mess
around<00:05:57.630> with<00:05:57.870> their<00:05:58.080> keyboards<00:05:58.590> and<00:05:58.800> in<00:05:59.370> the

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
around with their keyboards and in the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.820 
around with their keyboards and in the
older<00:05:59.760> t<00:05:59.970> 60<00:06:00.330> series<00:06:00.660> this<00:06:01.290> was<00:06:01.470> basically

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
older t 60 series this was basically

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.340 
older t 60 series this was basically
just<00:06:01.950> a<00:06:02.190> flat<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:03.150> know<00:06:03.240> slab<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.900> metal<00:06:04.170> was

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
just a flat you know slab of metal was

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.400 
just a flat you know slab of metal was
really<00:06:04.680> solid<00:06:05.390> mighty<00:06:06.390> 40<00:06:06.840> was<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:06.990> same<00:06:07.260> way

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
really solid mighty 40 was the same way

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.750 
really solid mighty 40 was the same way
actually<00:06:07.650> there's<00:06:08.100> none<00:06:08.280> of<00:06:08.310> these<00:06:08.490> little

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
actually there's none of these little

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.030 
actually there's none of these little
holes<00:06:08.940> but<00:06:09.420> what<00:06:09.480> lenovo<00:06:10.050> did<00:06:10.230> in<00:06:10.350> the<00:06:10.410> t<00:06:10.560> 400

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
holes but what lenovo did in the t 400

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.350 
holes but what lenovo did in the t 400
series<00:06:11.310> is<00:06:11.580> they<00:06:11.670> went<00:06:11.850> and<00:06:11.970> drilled<00:06:12.210> out

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
series is they went and drilled out

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.990 
series is they went and drilled out
these<00:06:12.510> little<00:06:12.750> holes<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:13.170> kind<00:06:13.410> of<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:14.000> weight

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
these little holes is kind of a weight

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.080 
these little holes is kind of a weight
saving<00:06:15.330> measure<00:06:16.310> kind<00:06:17.310> of<00:06:17.370> backfired<00:06:17.790> on<00:06:17.910> them

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
saving measure kind of backfired on them

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.430 
saving measure kind of backfired on them
so<00:06:18.300> they<00:06:18.360> had<00:06:18.480> to<00:06:18.540> go<00:06:18.660> through<00:06:18.840> and<00:06:19.020> redesign

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
so they had to go through and redesign

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.560 
so they had to go through and redesign
it<00:06:19.470> and<00:06:19.740> this<00:06:20.670> one<00:06:20.850> is<00:06:20.940> actually<00:06:21.360> really

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
it and this one is actually really

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.190 
it and this one is actually really
sturdy<00:06:21.990> you<00:06:22.530> can<00:06:22.560> put<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:22.890> lot<00:06:23.070> of<00:06:23.780> force<00:06:24.780> on<00:06:25.080> it

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
sturdy you can put a lot of force on it

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.790 
sturdy you can put a lot of force on it
and<00:06:25.290> it<00:06:25.350> won't<00:06:25.440> really<00:06:25.560> bend<00:06:26.040> or<00:06:26.400> work<00:06:26.940> at<00:06:27.150> all

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
and it won't really bend or work at all

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.890 
and it won't really bend or work at all
and<00:06:28.800> actually<00:06:29.730> in<00:06:30.000> an<00:06:30.090> earlier<00:06:30.360> video<00:06:30.510> i<00:06:30.660> found

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
and actually in an earlier video i found

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.240 
and actually in an earlier video i found
a<00:06:30.960> little<00:06:31.050> bit<00:06:31.200> of<00:06:31.260> keyboard<00:06:31.710> flex<00:06:32.010> on<00:06:32.160> the

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
a little bit of keyboard flex on the

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.280 
a little bit of keyboard flex on the
Escape<00:06:32.610> key<00:06:32.640> and<00:06:32.910> that<00:06:33.120> was<00:06:33.420> actually<00:06:33.600> fixed

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
Escape key and that was actually fixed

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.570 
Escape key and that was actually fixed
by<00:06:34.410> just<00:06:34.590> simply<00:06:34.800> removing<00:06:35.130> this<00:06:35.340> keyboard

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
by just simply removing this keyboard

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.670 
by just simply removing this keyboard
and<00:06:36.030> just<00:06:36.840> kind<00:06:37.020> of<00:06:37.050> making<00:06:37.200> sure<00:06:37.350> all<00:06:37.530> these

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
and just kind of making sure all these

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.200 
and just kind of making sure all these
little<00:06:37.800> paper<00:06:38.160> labels<00:06:38.640> were<00:06:38.760> out<00:06:38.880> of<00:06:39.000> the<00:06:39.090> way

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
little paper labels were out of the way

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.320 
little paper labels were out of the way
and<00:06:39.450> it's<00:06:39.930> no<00:06:40.200> longer<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.560> problem<00:06:41.180> I'm<00:06:42.180> gonna

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
and it's no longer a problem I'm gonna

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.670 
and it's no longer a problem I'm gonna
go<00:06:42.420> back<00:06:42.630> go<00:06:42.900> ahead<00:06:42.990> and<00:06:43.230> put<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.470> keyboard

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680

go back go ahead and put the keyboard
back<00:06:44.070> in<00:06:44.310> its<00:06:44.460> place<00:06:44.700> now<00:06:45.000> it's<00:06:45.450> just<00:06:46.020> exact

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
back in its place now it's just exact

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.170 
back in its place now it's just exact
opposite<00:06:47.280> of<00:06:47.340> how<00:06:47.400> you<00:06:47.520> took<00:06:47.910> it<00:06:47.970> out<00:06:49.100> pops<00:06:50.100> in

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
opposite of how you took it out pops in

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.330 
opposite of how you took it out pops in
just<00:06:52.900> slide<00:06:53.350> it<00:06:53.470> back<00:06:53.650> a<00:06:53.680> little<00:06:53.889> bit<00:06:54.070> you<00:06:54.130> want

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
to make sure that those little tabs get

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.420 
to make sure that those little tabs get
under<00:06:55.960> the<00:06:56.050> lip<00:06:56.229> for<00:06:57.039> the<00:06:57.130> palm<00:06:57.340> rest<00:06:59.430> all

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430

a<00:07:25.080> little<00:07:25.860> trick<00:07:26.130> with<00:07:26.250> these<00:07:26.370> things<00:07:26.640> I<00:07:26.790> found

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
a little trick with these things I found

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.880 
a little trick with these things I found
they<00:07:27.120> have<00:07:27.210> little<00:07:27.390> tiny<00:07:27.690> tabs<00:07:28.080> on<00:07:28.380> the<00:07:28.470> edges

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
I don't know if you can see it too well

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.860 
I don't know if you can see it too well
on<00:07:30.330> the<00:07:30.420> video<00:07:30.690> there<00:07:31.470> you<00:07:31.620> go<00:07:32.240> but<00:07:33.240> they<00:07:33.810> do

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
on the video there you go but they do

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.040 
on the video there you go but they do
kind<00:07:34.140> of<00:07:34.230> hinder<00:07:34.680> the<00:07:35.510> plastic<00:07:36.510> cover<00:07:36.720> going
