00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.369
 Mario Jorge 00 and we'll keep talking about the firewall 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.939
 the Powerful Training 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.169
 when walking on the embers 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.589
 many people 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.029
 I wonder 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.470
 since the opening 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.439
 carriÃ© on embers is a metaphor 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.649
 is a goal of the campaign is a metaphor 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.410
 but it is a metaphor of real life 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 literally at the end of this year the goal 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.089
 we are going to walk 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.270
 I consider that the carts 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.810
 the subway for free 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 called biba 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.560
 but that day will not burn 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.370
 and the big question is total because to challenge 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.710
 the Indian physics of the coast in the pants 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 on the embers 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.040
 oftentimes 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.409
 Have you noticed your life? 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.220
 This is going to be a pleasure. 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.660
 I can not 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.100
 I can not 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.850
 I'm incapable 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.590
 It's difficult, I believe. 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.120
 This is going to take a lot of time. 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.410
 these are examples of these militants with some present in our 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.390
 culture and our lives 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.680
 Since little 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.970
 we hear it all the time 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.270
 Do not do not do not do it. 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.460
 not 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.460
 and we ended up internalizing 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.630
 one centimeter of negativity difficulty 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.820
 walk on embers 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.340
 has as one of its purposes 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.030
 arrived to register national ' 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.090
 conscious conscious 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.680
 then death 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.000
 in your neurological system 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.750
 and limiting beliefs 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.670
 I would not take part in your life. 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 you will find out 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.010
 what else has changed 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.060
 because you will feel that you never felt 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.500
 an experience 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.280
 shocking 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.379

 balance success 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.149
 learning by remembering the past 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:21.799
 this fucking balance 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.909
 live to potentiate the present 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.829
 this type of crime 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.249
 I got 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.439
