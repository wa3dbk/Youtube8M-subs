00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:28.000
 also this without knowing all my life 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.710
 the reasons for a peace 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.900
 but they forget 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.160
 I do not know if I 'm looking for more friends 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.160
 more of you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 do not 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.110
 I want 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.110
 love 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.110

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.299
 is 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.990
 hi hello what's your name carme castilla 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.170
 hi karime how old are you 13 13 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.150
 good input and stealing a bit the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 phrase of anna carina you are already in the voice 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.310
 kids welcome and congratulations and thank you 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.030
 I think your interpretation is very nice 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.070
 you have to take care of the pitch a bit 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.290
 intonation in general take care of nothing else 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.159
 but its interpretation really comes 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.159
 of happiness is why 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.910
 It is not easy being where you are is 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.440
 a bit complicated I'm telling you I do not 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.050
 I would like to stand and in this 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.970
 moment but you have done very well there 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.670
 that feed a little more that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.310
 feeling to be able to see the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.540
 tunings and if you come to the team 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.040
 definitely all that is going to 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.040
 fix up to date 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.400
 there is something basic in you 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.980
 that for me is the fundamental key of 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.540
 an artist and is transmitting your transmites 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.160
 with your voice sometimes one does not necessarily 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.440
 it has to be so big vocally 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.640
 because one can carry the most notes 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.730
 high or serious 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.459
 but your voice simply transmits and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.750
 that for me is the most important thing in a 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.940
 artist broadcasts with your voice 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.350
 effectively as it says goes maybe there's 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.459
 have to work a little bit but that's the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.320
 challenge not to be here to guide you 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.290
 accompany you in this great adventure and 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.970
 would be for me the most you share 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.970
 that adventure with me so 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.420
 with whom you stay Queen 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.540

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.410
