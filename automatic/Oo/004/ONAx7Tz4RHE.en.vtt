00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.480
I said it was nothing, and shut my mouth.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
The truth is I kind of want to stop my legs.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.880
Even then, since you go straight ahead of me at a quick pace,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.420
I'm staring at that.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.580
You get on the last flight. You're leaving me,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.620
And I start to run. The ground is slowly going out of place.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.300
I shouldn't cry. I shouldn't cry.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.160
But the truth is I wanna say it.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.700
"Don't go."

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.440
You're vanishing toward the distance. You're leaving me,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.440
And I can't see you at all anymore. The night is crumbling.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.120
I shouldn't cry. I shouldn't cry.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.000
But the truth is I wanna say it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.620
"Don't go."

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.160
If the festival ends, it'll be the same as always.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.000
I knew that an unchanging night would come.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.980
Even then, you look far more cute than you usually do,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.400
And I'm staring at that.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.880
Only time is passing. it's taking me with it.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Although the way home is dark, I wonder if I'll be alright alone.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.920
I'm shined on by the streetlights and shadows are coming out.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.460
I'm all alone, see.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.180
You're vanishing toward the distance. You're leaving me,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.040
And the night is perfectly blurring this time around too.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.880
I shouldn t cry. I shouldn't cry.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560
But the truth is I wanna say it.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.740
"Don't go."

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.820
You're vanishing toward the distance. You're leaving me,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.660
And the night is perfectly blurring this time around too.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.060
I shouldn't cry. I shouldn't cry.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.200
But the truth is I wanna say it.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560
"Don't go."

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.220
I shouldn't cry. I shouldn't cry.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.460
But the truth is I wanna say it.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.580
"Don't go."
