00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
change that I'm going to be making to

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.390 
change that I'm going to be making to
this<00:00:14.910> fast<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.780> make<00:00:15.960> sure<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.039> take

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
this fast is to make sure that I take

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.080 
this fast is to make sure that I take
time<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.850> every<00:00:18.449> day<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.410> go<00:00:19.830> outside<00:00:20.090> spend

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
time out every day to go outside spend

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.359 
time out every day to go outside spend
some<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.480> alone<00:00:21.740> meditating<00:00:22.740> thinking

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
some time alone meditating thinking

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.509 
some time alone meditating thinking
whatever<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:25.019> did<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
whatever I did a little bit of that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.310 
whatever I did a little bit of that
during<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:26.849> last<00:00:27.000> fast<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> definitely

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
during my last fast but it definitely

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.919 
during my last fast but it definitely
wasn't<00:00:28.800> enough<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.449> part<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
wasn't enough and I think part of the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.380 
wasn't enough and I think part of the
reason<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.260> couldn't<00:00:31.619> enjoy<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.219> much<00:00:32.390> first

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
reason I couldn't enjoy it as much first

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.610 
reason I couldn't enjoy it as much first
of<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> weather<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.530> bit

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of all the weather was a little bit

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
of all the weather was a little bit
worse<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.430> harder<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:36.120> outside<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
worse so it was harder to go outside and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.860 
worse so it was harder to go outside and
enjoy<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.980> also<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.059> fact<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.660> so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
enjoy but also the fact that it was so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440 
enjoy but also the fact that it was so
physically<00:00:40.559> painful<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.489> me<00:00:41.700> because<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> my

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
physically painful for me because of my

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.799 
physically painful for me because of my
lack<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> preparation<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.390> diet

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
lack of preparation and the way my diet

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.250 
lack of preparation and the way my diet
was<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.079> terrible<00:00:46.440> before<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.570> detox<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
was so terrible before the detox was so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
was so terrible before the detox was so
aggressive<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:51.260> was<00:00:52.610> mostly<00:00:53.610> focused<00:00:54.329> on

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
aggressive that I was mostly focused on

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
aggressive that I was mostly focused on
that<00:00:54.629> rather<00:00:54.989> than<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.680> whole<00:00:55.980> mental

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that rather than the whole mental

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.450 
that rather than the whole mental
clarity<00:00:57.059> side<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.309> going

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
clarity side of it and I think I'm going

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
clarity side of it and I think I'm going
to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.670> able<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> enjoy<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> lot<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:01.050> this

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to be able to enjoy that a lot more this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.619 
to be able to enjoy that a lot more this
time<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> make

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
time and if I don't I'm going to make

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
time and if I don't I'm going to make
myself<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.760> sure<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
myself so I'm just going to make sure I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
myself so I'm just going to make sure I

thing I'm doing differently is to make

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.429 
thing I'm doing differently is to make
an<00:01:19.140> effort<00:01:19.290> once<00:01:19.890> again<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:22.170> bit

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
an effort once again to do a little bit

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.370 
an effort once again to do a little bit
of<00:01:22.710> either<00:01:23.310> stretching<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.270> light<00:01:24.600> walking<00:01:25.140> or

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.039 
of either stretching or light walking or
yoga<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.250> knew<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
yoga if I knew it just to be a little

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
yoga if I knew it just to be a little
bit<00:01:28.439> active<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.100> something<00:01:29.610> physical<00:01:29.759> each

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
bit active to do something physical each

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.530 
bit active to do something physical each
day<00:01:30.590> last<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.340> didn't<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.329> much

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
day last time I didn't do that very much

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.640 
day last time I didn't do that very much
at<00:01:33.900> all

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
at all

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
at all
some<00:01:35.040> days<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.369> went<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.299> town<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.540> went

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
some days I went to town and went

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
some days I went to town and went
shopping<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.500> little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
shopping for a little bit but for the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.340 
shopping for a little bit but for the
most<00:01:38.880> part<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.630> was<00:01:40.590> very<00:01:41.540> much<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> lump<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
most part I was very much like a lump on

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
most part I was very much like a lump on
the<00:01:43.560> log<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:45.500> that's<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.860> felt<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.399> that's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the log and that's I felt like that's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
the log and that's I felt like that's
all<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:47.939> afford<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> time

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
all I could afford to do at the time

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.350 
all I could afford to do at the time
which<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.740> good<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.360> push

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
which I don't think it's good to push

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.899 
which I don't think it's good to push
yourself<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.409> beyond<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.670> body<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
yourself to do beyond what your body is

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.630 
yourself to do beyond what your body is
wanting<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.219> bit

the most out of the whole experience

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.190 
the most out of the whole experience

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
because after that fast was over I found

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.800 
because after that fast was over I found
myself<00:02:31.440> really<00:02:31.800> missing<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.700> missing<00:02:33.390> the

myself really missing it and missing the
the<00:02:34.400> way<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> felt<00:02:35.880> during<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.960> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
the way that I felt during it and I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
the way that I felt during it and I
don't<00:02:40.110> know<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.950> hard<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.310> explain<00:02:41.610> unless

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
don't know it's hard to explain unless

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.350 
don't know it's hard to explain unless
you've<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.270> gone<00:02:42.420> through<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:44.360> want

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you've really gone through it but I want

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.970 
you've really gone through it but I want
to<00:02:45.450> actually<00:02:45.600> appreciate<00:02:46.110> everything<00:02:46.830> that's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
to actually appreciate everything that's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.770 
to actually appreciate everything that's
happening<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.460> my<00:02:47.550> body<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:48.030> time<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.630> not

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
happening in my body this time and not

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.360 
happening in my body this time and not
just<00:02:49.170> dread<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.130> pain<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> detox<00:02:50.820> or

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
just dread the pain of the detox or

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.860 
just dread the pain of the detox or
dread<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.610> another<00:02:53.790> day<00:02:54.000> without<00:02:54.150> food<00:02:54.600> I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
dread going another day without food I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.640 
dread going another day without food I
really<00:02:54.900> want<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.950> actually<00:02:56.700> enjoy<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.140> I

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
really want to actually enjoy it and I

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.300 
really want to actually enjoy it and I
think<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.070> will<00:02:59.340> because<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.890> don't<00:03:02.100> know

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
think that I will because you don't know

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.670 
think that I will because you don't know
what<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.610> have<00:03:02.820> until<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.150> gone<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.960> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
what you have until it's gone and I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.860 
what you have until it's gone and I
think<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.010> applies<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.310> fasting<00:03:06.090> we<00:03:06.570> hear<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
think that applies to fasting we hear it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.540 
think that applies to fasting we hear it
all<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.020> time<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.800> think<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.310> applies

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
all the time but I do think it applies

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.000 
all the time but I do think it applies
to<00:03:08.730> fasting<00:03:09.180> once<00:03:09.840> too<00:03:10.020> fast<00:03:10.350> especially<00:03:10.709> if

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
to fasting once too fast especially if

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.580 
to fasting once too fast especially if
it's<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> long<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.610> once<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:11.970> over<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.600> just

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it's a long one once it's over you just

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.170 
it's a long one once it's over you just
don't<00:03:13.770> know<00:03:13.920> what<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.250> had<00:03:14.400> until<00:03:14.880> you're<00:03:15.060> not

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
don't know what you had until you're not

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.010 
don't know what you had until you're not
doing<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.690> anymore<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:17.000> no<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> enjoy<00:03:18.450> eating<00:03:18.720> I

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.350 
doing it anymore and no I enjoy eating I
definitely<00:03:19.650> do<00:03:19.770> enjoy<00:03:20.010> fasting<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.090> time

to enjoy it and to make the most out of
