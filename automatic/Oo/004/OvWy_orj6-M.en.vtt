00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
bit about the guitar bending and vibrato

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.270 
bit about the guitar bending and vibrato
and<00:00:31.590> glistens<00:00:32.590> we<00:00:32.710> can<00:00:32.860> get<00:00:33.010> on<00:00:33.129> this

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
and glistens we can get on this

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.790 
and glistens we can get on this
instrument<00:00:33.840> many<00:00:34.840> people<00:00:35.170> assume<00:00:35.500> just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
instrument many people assume just

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.700 
instrument many people assume just
because<00:00:35.829> as<00:00:36.280> frets<00:00:36.820> it's<00:00:37.210> not<00:00:38.110> friendly<00:00:38.440> for

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
because as frets it's not friendly for

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.590 
because as frets it's not friendly for
that<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.460> could<00:00:39.670> not<00:00:39.969> be<00:00:40.000> farther<00:00:40.450> from

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
that and that could not be farther from

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
that and that could not be farther from
the<00:00:40.870> truth

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the truth

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.779 
the truth
first<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.930> all<00:00:44.079> I<00:00:44.679> wanted<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.190> describe<00:00:45.550> the

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
first of all I wanted to describe the

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.810 
first of all I wanted to describe the
what's<00:00:45.999> on<00:00:46.089> this<00:00:46.239> particular<00:00:46.809> one<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.550> one

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
what's on this particular one this one

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.439 
what's on this particular one this one
has<00:00:49.030> scallops<00:00:49.870> on<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.379> can<00:00:50.559> see<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:52.149> frets

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
has scallops on it you can see the frets

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.450 
has scallops on it you can see the frets
were<00:00:52.569> actually<00:00:52.839> put<00:00:53.019> in<00:00:53.170> when<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:53.469> was<00:00:53.499> flushed

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
were actually put in when it was flushed

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.770 
were actually put in when it was flushed
with<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.699> fingerboard<00:00:55.059> so<00:00:55.329> they<00:00:55.420> were<00:00:55.480> kind

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
with the fingerboard so they were kind

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.180 
with the fingerboard so they were kind
of<00:00:55.809> like<00:00:55.899> fret<00:00:56.260> lines<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.920> then<00:00:57.039> they<00:00:57.129> were

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
of like fret lines and then they were

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.579 
of like fret lines and then they were
scalloped<00:00:57.789> this<00:00:58.690> kind<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.019> creates<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.469> nice

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
scalloped this kind of creates a nice

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.489 
scalloped this kind of creates a nice
woody<00:01:00.129> you<00:01:00.999> note<00:01:01.149> on<00:01:01.390> these<00:01:01.690> frets<00:01:02.050> as<00:01:02.199> opposed

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
woody you note on these frets as opposed

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.430 
woody you note on these frets as opposed
to<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:03.069> know<00:01:03.159> really<00:01:03.370> metallic<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:05.170> it's<00:01:05.290> got

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
to you know really metallic so it's got

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.310 
to you know really metallic so it's got
a<00:01:05.470> nice<00:01:05.650> warm<00:01:05.920> buttery<00:01:06.580> sound<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:07.150> it<00:01:07.320> okay

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
a nice warm buttery sound to it okay

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.860 
a nice warm buttery sound to it okay
when<00:01:08.470> we<00:01:08.590> do<00:01:09.010> a<00:01:09.040> bend<00:01:09.790> very<00:01:10.120> much<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.840> your

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
when we do a bend very much of your

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:20.010 
when we do a bend very much of your
guitar

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.600 

and<00:01:21.020> also<00:01:21.200> I'm<00:01:21.439> following<00:01:21.920> these<00:01:22.070> phrases

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
and also I'm following these phrases

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.280 
and also I'm following these phrases
with<00:01:22.790> some<00:01:22.970> guitar<00:01:23.270> vibrato<00:01:29.110> kind<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.170> like

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
with some guitar vibrato kind of like

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.139 
with some guitar vibrato kind of like
when<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.710> remember<00:01:31.280> being<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.610> kid<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.850> watched

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
when I remember being a kid I watched

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.980 
when I remember being a kid I watched
Amy<00:01:32.570> King<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.960> TV<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.470> he<00:01:33.590> did<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.920> kind<00:01:34.100> of

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
Amy King on TV and he did this kind of

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.690 
Amy King on TV and he did this kind of
kind<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.020> almost<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.440> blues<00:01:36.680> canon<00:01:37.070> vibrato<00:01:37.369> so

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
kind of almost a blues canon vibrato so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.170 
kind of almost a blues canon vibrato so
we're<00:01:37.850> kind<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.090> doing<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.600> fiddle<00:01:39.020> here

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
we're kind of doing it on a fiddle here

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.899 
we're kind of doing it on a fiddle here
the<00:01:41.180> other<00:01:41.330> type<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.670> basically<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
the other type is basically the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.920 
the other type is basically the
classical<00:01:44.450> violinist<00:01:45.049> type<00:01:45.710> which<00:01:46.659> I'll<00:01:47.659> do

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
classical violinist type which I'll do

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.719 
classical violinist type which I'll do
my<00:01:48.110> best

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
my best

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.809 
my best
anyway<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:50.630> involves<00:01:51.229> pressing<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.610> spring

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
anyway this involves pressing the spring

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:11.110 
anyway this involves pressing the spring
not<00:01:53.090> all<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.330> way<00:01:53.450> down

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.660 

so<00:02:12.120> basically<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.260> involves<00:02:14.100> not<00:02:14.340> pushing

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so basically that involves not pushing

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.040 
so basically that involves not pushing
the<00:02:14.880> string<00:02:15.120> all<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.240> way<00:02:15.300> down<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> fret<00:02:15.900> now

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the string all the way down the fret now

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
the string all the way down the fret now
what<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.680> start<00:02:17.010> by<00:02:17.310> pressing<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
what I can do is start by pressing the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.380 
what I can do is start by pressing the
note<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> fret<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.550> get<00:02:20.700> my<00:02:20.880> bearings

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
note to the fret just to get my bearings

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.350 
note to the fret just to get my bearings
a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.720> bit<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> then<00:02:22.320> ease<00:02:22.800> off<00:02:25.520> or<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:27.180> can

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
a little bit and then ease off or we can

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.270 
a little bit and then ease off or we can
do<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> guitar<00:02:27.900> style<00:02:28.230> vibrato<00:02:28.800> which<00:02:29.130> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
do the guitar style vibrato which is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.960 
do the guitar style vibrato which is
just<00:02:29.640> pressing<00:02:30.030> down<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.850> know

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
just pressing down like a you know

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.960 
just pressing down like a you know
normal<00:02:33.330> guitar<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.620> actually<00:02:34.850> kind<00:02:35.850> of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
normal guitar so we can actually kind of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.290 
normal guitar so we can actually kind of
cross<00:02:36.270> pollinate<00:02:37.050> these<00:02:37.260> expressions<00:02:38.300> from

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
cross pollinate these expressions from

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:51.960 
cross pollinate these expressions from
bending<00:02:42.560> guitar<00:02:43.560> vibrato<00:02:46.310> violin

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.900 

-<00:02:52.970> vibrato<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.350> we<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.830> really<00:02:55.160> get<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.580> lot<00:02:55.760> of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
- vibrato so we can really get a lot of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.070 
- vibrato so we can really get a lot of
range<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.660> expression<00:02:57.260> here<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:02.630> we<00:03:02.720> wanna<00:03:02.930> do

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
range of expression here if we wanna do

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.470 
range of expression here if we wanna do
some<00:03:03.230> gypsy<00:03:03.650> jazz<00:03:03.860> kind<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.370> Grappelli<00:03:04.910> kind

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
some gypsy jazz kind of Grappelli kind

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.720 
some gypsy jazz kind of Grappelli kind
of<00:03:07.390> inflections<00:03:08.390> or<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.709> do<00:03:10.100> like<00:03:10.340> double

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
of inflections or we can do like double

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.530
