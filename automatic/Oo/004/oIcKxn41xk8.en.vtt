00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.099
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.130
 my youtube channel for the second film 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.560
 over the phantom two quadrocopters 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.770
 Today we both want to show you 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.710
 how easy the assembly of the head 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.260
 is before I do that now but still 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.730
 my thanks to the company sun file belong 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.400
 which my head he kindly 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.269
 for this miniserie available here 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.269
 has made 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.820
 First and foremost, we take it first 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.520
 once the battery from the battery 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.720
 head out front the sticker 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.300
 from the on is and load now as 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.210
 First of all the battery once on the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.250
 is only on a stock voltage and 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.730
 must be charged before the first fly 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.680
 become 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.870
 that's why we take the charger 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.270
 unfold the page and put it there 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.240
 then the plug of the charger to the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.520
 side of the batteries is now a front 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 recognize blinking and you see that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.900
 now the battery is charging 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.479
 Next we have to go 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.080
 and the propellers on the four engines 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.790
 do 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.670
 First of all we go there and 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.060
 remove these yellow warning notices from 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.940
 The motors simply all four fixed after 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.500
 pull off the top and put aside the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.410
 we do not need more then 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.970
 then we'll take the next one 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.040
 propeller we have to pay attention 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.560
 that there are two different propellers 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.260
 give some with silver mother 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920
 and once with black mother 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.190
 on top 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.950
 the colors of this are analogous for 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.010
 small dots on the engines above 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.540
 on it the propellers are the ones to the one 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.820
 black mother have come too 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.520
 Motors with a black dot and 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.909
 the propeller with a silver head 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 get on motors with one with one 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.979
 jahn's first silver screw 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.820
 black propeller and lay the times 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.350
 on top of the black engine on it 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.360
 now has to counterclockwise 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.489
 just be fixed once 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.320
 counterclockwise until it turns 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.480
 no longer turns then take us 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.530
 next propeller before the silver one 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.610
 comes now wrong 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.350
 it is turned firmly clockwise 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.590
 and so we proceed with the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.080
 next we take next 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.120
 us then the supplied tool and 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040
 pull the propellers again 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.799
 Neatly she sets that 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.250
 Tool from above on the nose on the engine 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.930
 and then move the propeller in 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.060
 the appropriate direction that too 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.680
 the propeller pictured as the firm 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.260
 is turned 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.299
 we have to repeat the whole thing then 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.120
 of course with all four propellers and 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.159
 then take the tool down again 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.209
 next we'll take the 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.650
 Remote control ahead here are still 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.719
 some signs on it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.459
 which we can do off then first 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:09.049
 we'll do it in the back on the back 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 sign on which the led lights and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.450
 hints of the phantom accordingly 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.799
 be explained 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.560
 you should definitely do that 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.930
 watch and then you can also off 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.659
 Next , we'll take care of each other 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.109
 the remote control itself on the iss 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.269
 on top of that a description of all levers 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.849
 At the control lever you can if 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.319
 you've never flown a head since 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.329
 At the beginning also let it be so 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.030
 can check from time to time during the 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.769
 flight for what that is the whole but 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.250
 already knows the accordingly can also 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.859
 then turn off this sign 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.200
 then we turn the remote control once 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.530
 on the back because there is 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.510
 the battery compartment that opens then and 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.900
 in the battery compartment you have four 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.709
 double aaa batteries or double batteries 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.870
 insert 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.579
 of course pay attention to this 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.530
 and are full or eyes if 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.659
 there are batteries that this accordingly 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.489
 are charged and of course that they are 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.739
 to be inserted correctly 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.019
 Last but not least, we will go there and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.090
 still need stickers on your head there 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.349
 make that are yes with the scope of delivery 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.849
 First of all we take the 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:19.169
 Strip and glue on the front 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.570
 arms of the victim 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.690
 we'll turn red here but you can 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.820
 Of course, take blue or pink 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.250
 if you like the shorter ones 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.849
 be tilted forward and the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.990
 longer back to the conclusion comes 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.800
 then another 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.460
 the stickers right in the middle and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.539
 then we have the dji of thom two 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.539
 completely assembled
