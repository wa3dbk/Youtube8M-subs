00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello my name is evgeny i would 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:13.230
 I wanted to show you my cube bike 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.440
 2014 attention on 29 wheels here 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.980
 bought it for 30 thousand thirty half 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:27.029
 bought wings separately for 900 rubles 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:30.090
 my here and since I am a complete noob 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.369
 let's say so mountain run akhun is of course 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 appeared at a detailed examination 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.840
 some questions here for example no 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 no indication of speed 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.329
 should not be so because and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.649
 on a bead simple even for ten thousand 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:01:00.210
 I have seen some great mountain 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:03.059
 the numbers here have nothing just just 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.549
 here's a red arrow and everything should be so 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:17.140
 to be or not I do not know here further 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:19.390
 further well, for example, here are the teeth 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.030
 It made me think somehow everything 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.130
 carelessly 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.820
 here is one big tooth another 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.619
 little I don't know should be so not 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.409
 there must be some riveting 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.680
 what it is for what it is also incomprehensible 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.659
 then you are no stub here 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.530
 must be she shouldn't know either 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:45.399
 well and the most interesting since I know that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.369
 shaman to japanese firm but written 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.520
 made in malaysia 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:59.310
 here maybe going there not 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.310
 Well, so I want to capture a general view 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.780
 maybe someone is something professional 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.220
 who knows all these bikes well 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.019
 see something you can be 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.630
 tell me what you can tune 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:22.560
 Well, that's what to check how it works 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:28.200
 as it should, how should it be 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.690
 well the only thing on the brake on the rear 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:37.049
 front I did not try to slow down 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:39.750
 very well press down should 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.680
 I am so or not do not know the idea on 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.370
 hydraulically they must dead cling 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.549
 it seems there is no such thing as 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.549
 usually mechanics in general but still on 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.549
 the role i correctly installed is wrong 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.430
 I donâ€™t know some rice. 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:07.100
 here on it to install or not because 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.370
 what great was assembled i went bought 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.370
 still 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:21.780
 here are the front days brake logan 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 fork 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.170
 read about the plug that 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.290
 it seems to be good it seems not very good 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.480
 he himself is here for me a little bit of course 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.950
 Frankly , I first wanted to 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.370
 buy on the twenty-sixth wheels 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.069
 there is a rear rear derailleur 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:47.319
 shimano ice to excel in my well, as the 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.190
 so called that is a level above 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:55.349
 but I saw on the 29th corps and he is more 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.349
 I liked it easier here 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.110
 Well, so she looks
