00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.679
 hi to all and domingo and we get 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 found Thursday for a new video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.230
 so if you do not know too much for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.360
 introduce myself quickly so I am 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 commentator on decerto france and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.090
 gaming so I commented different there 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.590
 we may have already seen my little head 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.310
 and today we are left with a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.050
 video precisely 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.609
 certainly the title is a little teasing I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.689
 I will not hide it, I do not have you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.189
 learn today to make tons 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.779
 like gotha ​​or other things the most 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 precisely you talk a little bit about the side 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 hidden from how to break into a decerto 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 how to arrive a little bit in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.059
 the example of melo in 7 8 months precisely 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.460
 to make a name on the stage to be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.020
 to be respected simply and therefore 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.370
 so it's really not easy I 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.510
 will not lie to you if you arrive 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.570
 right now on the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 coffins scene is unknown to you 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.690
 do not send a message to gotha ​​in mode 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 clashes made a scream it will not be 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 will not be possible guys already going 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.469
 have to make yourself a place 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.879
 and for that I will try to the maximum of 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.090
 give you some tips 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.350
 and help you in your steps then done 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.850
 what is watching this video here 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.840
 does some playing time that they 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 do not arrive exactly 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.390
 might like a little bit more that can 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.159
 serve you what I'm going to say for 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.630
 some it will already be it will already be 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.710
 known in their heads but I think that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.850
 it can help a lot of people because 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.260
 many people have me 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 asked for example the paris games week 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.189
 a bit of both just a little 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 just to know how it was 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.220
 possible to go a little bit higher and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.420
 so already I advise you to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.710
 register on decerto france for example 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.970
 if you know no big world if 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.259
 you often play live you have 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.939
 want to get started in the decerto 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.930
 you register on decerto france 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.939
 you do a little topic 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.920
 so just in there is going 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.360
 must be very careful with the words a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.130
 little you use because we can very 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.540
 quickly categorize us it's a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.030
 little the problem of the community decerto 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.979
 dry on and here we are like that we are 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.570
 a little bit of a little kids but 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.250
 here we are a little flyers we are a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.530
 little like that something goes wrong 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.299
 pass it will not be good do not talk about your 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 ratios that kind of things one is not 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.329
 there precisely to show the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.799
 racial hints the accuracy every 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.360
 online stats will not count and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.770
 it is sad enough to say but 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.090
 if nothing you mention in your 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.710
 bios finally in your presentation 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.450
 it will immediately eliminate you from 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.369
 teams correct since you will take 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.960
 for a live look so here I am you 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.579
 really advise to create a topic on 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.840
 decerto france of presentation or of 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.210
 search for example for them that for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.110
 this crime x with people overcharge ghost 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 there the rules are coming out 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.959
 so we'll have more 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.459
 of scream x you really need you 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.049
 to make a place in fencing x you 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.599
 to make a small directory of 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.670
 jean ac here you are rubbing shoulders at the beginning and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.110
 it's for already played against them evaluate 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.159
 your first level is also I you 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.200
 may advise to make an account 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.670
 twitter it's true that here we are in 2013 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.140
 It's November 6th, on time 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.510
 current and this with the cons place 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.159
 twitter about the community decerto it's 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.079
 almost everything we see a beautiful talent 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.640
 acquired 180 thousand ha ben subscribers by 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.980
 example this is it represents 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.150
 really a lot of things that allows 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.200
 also to discuss with people from 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.000
 to meet new people 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.500
 and that's just to make you do a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.299
 little name like that already on the stage at 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.819
 little by little so that's during his 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.139
 mixes so the coup is not that the guen 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.359
 style I want to say and the brain 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.340
 to progress in decerto finally there are 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.849
 also brein outside know I lie 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.170
 to know how to know how to have a place 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.329
 precisely with the people with whom 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.099
 you're not screaming this crime not you 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.329
 go do crime mix purposes I you 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.439
 advise here to try maybe if 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.760
 you have affinities if you see 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.139
 that it plays well between some 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.180
 maybe to try to build a team 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.739
 and then participated in areas and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.790
 it's the odc it's a bit of a start 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.650
 it's really the year down the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.700
 pyramid but you must you must there 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.230
 was just going to ride the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
 steps and that's how it's in 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.329
 doing small tournaments small 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.220
 of death precisely you will prove 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.900
 your level you go little by little 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.669
 started already make you a name and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 maybe the guys with whom you have 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.940
 started at the very beginning 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.560
 if you too think they are not 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.090
 not good enough you can already passed 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.590
 in a higher stage meet with 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.609
 best teammates and it's true that 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.909
 that's going to help you 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.349
 to have a facility a little bigger 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.510
 so precisely if you already arrive 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.370
 you make a pretty important name to 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.840
 from there what is really not 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.280
 necessarily easy I repeat again one 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.799
 time it takes me a lot of time 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.629
 people that's it's taking an amount not 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.909
 you must never overestimate yourself 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.019
 in public this is something that can 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.729
 just kill your reputation 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.349
 as I said it is in 2013 the 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.699
 reputation on twitter on the internet 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.560
 it's very very important and in the 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.389
 community of some as well if ever 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.220
 people have the impression that you are 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.239
 Feel too strong or play well in 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.040
 mode I burst everyone on twitter 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.419
 or what you have no chance 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.479
 we have quite a few examples with 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.159
 people who do not necessarily have to ask 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.359
 a lot but because what they receive 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.659
 a little the return of the stick 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.609
 For example, we had to have a pic or that is 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.229
 who and who undergoes a little this and that after 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.190
 it will follow you all the time so you 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.810
 really advise to pay attention 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.609
 even if you just manage to prove 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.269
 it's useless to say next lan I 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.280
 will finish pro 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.330
 and I'm going to blow everyone up because 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.590
 that necessarily it will not necessarily 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.009
 the case while the screen behind there 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.389
 it's a little dark and so 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.919
 we finally get there guys 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.319
 apartment you have precisely this 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.849
 team you have a lot of training 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.740
 it takes much played it is time 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.000
 to go to the lan lan is really what 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.900
 that will allow you to suffer usefully 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.759
 in another dimension 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.740
 you are beautiful you make beautiful 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.470
 even scream against 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.840
 vitality in addition against the millennial of the 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.979
 blow it to split but I understood against 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.629
 the big French teams 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.590
 you can beat them if you ever 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.030
 beat them but you leave zero 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.530
 part you will be treated of conecteo it is 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.610
 like that it's not 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.470
 necessarily easy it's not necessarily 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.389
 cool but must we do with 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.620
 after that you have to go to lan 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.389
 have to prove that you are just 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.860
 not a connecto during the season bo2 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.590
 a lot of people it started with the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.699
 bobs at the very beginning of the year was treated 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.560
 of conecteo because precisely there is 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.360
 results online and partly you 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.500
 are discredited in fact m ok you 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.849
 federate söderling but it's just because 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.169
 that you have of the connection is what 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.060
 is not necessarily true precisely you 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.009
 will prove to people that it's not 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.360
 inevitably that that you're too 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.009
 a very big player in terms of brain 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.120
 in terms of levels and then the if 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.919
 you get to prove though 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.330
 precisely lan you're solid there 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.650
 you will be able to continue climbing 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.449
 even higher and precisely team and 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.469
 with people always stronger then 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.060
 here I hope that there are some 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.349
 hints that a lot of you 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.030
 will know but I think it will serve 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.440
 a little more to beginners to people who 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.229
 begin 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.460
 that's it will help you that you know it's 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.440
 maybe break into this world we have 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.870
 this season we had players 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.889
 who have drilled little by little but that's 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.750
 more and more hard the more the cases the 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.250
 finance then the community is formed and 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.680
 it is not necessarily the place to 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.210
 new players and that's enough 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.310
 complicated precisely but try to 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.469
 remember at least that advice about 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.819
 twitter accounts on social networks 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.750
 not to put you too much forward 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.819
 put yourself forward in a way 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.919
 positive it's useless to just 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.599
 to make the one who gets farted any kind of 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.009
 things because the reputation you 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.710
 will always follow in the community 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.569
 decerto and we really do not let the 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.650
 room for error it's always on very 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.190
 complicated sometimes to get rid of a 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.990
 reputation 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.029
 in any case I hope that this season 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.169
 gastou will succeed very well I have the game 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.020
 already since yesterday it's a game that 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.520
 I appreciate a lot personally I do not 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.719
 will not play me I just give some 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.219
 advice from my point of view 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.960
 a bit outside since I'm not 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.510
 player myself I saw a lot of people 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.460
 to ride I mounted 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.140
 but in another area and that's it 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.370
 I hope that precisely 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.660
 enjoy to other people this 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.610
 community will still be able to grow 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.950
 improve and see again from 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.710
 newcomers coming newcomer forgiveness is 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.860
 a bit for the hard scrap games miles 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.390
 and be with you guys and budak cents 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.530
 I really hope you're going 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.640
 just go there if it's 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.230
 really what you want breakthrough 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.670
 in the competition decerto must you in 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.660
 to give the means to play foul foul 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.760
 to watch scream 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.780
 look at the players if for example you 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.480
 like a lot of eyelash players 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.760
 carnage gotha ​​azox everyone like 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.530
 broken etc watch them watch them 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.330
 toys learn from the moves 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.680
 it's 90% of the game everyone pretty much 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.910
 near the same level of shoot unless 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.320
 old paris delayed targeted who holds 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.420
 in the pigeons but that's what kind of 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.740
 little detail that will make you 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.270
 are able to make a difference 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.710
 range and I wish you in any case 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.070
 see you soon I hope this video 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.070
