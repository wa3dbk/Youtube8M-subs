Clips<00:01:42.090> too<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.750> again<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> vacation

Clips too because again I'm on vacation
I'm<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.820> quarter<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> an

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I'm just going for like a quarter of an

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.020 
I'm just going for like a quarter of an
inch<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:49.020> inch<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:50.189> always<00:01:50.460> ends<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.850> being

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
inch to an inch it always ends up being

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
inch to an inch it always ends up being
more<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
more but the way to really get this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
more but the way to really get this
going<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.750> use<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
going is just use a little bit on the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.179 
going is just use a little bit on the
brush<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.450> color<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.079> net<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
brush you want to color the net of the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.690 
brush you want to color the net of the
wig<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.579> well<00:01:59.840> because<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> Nets<00:02:01.369> match<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
wig as well because the Nets match the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
wig as well because the Nets match the
hair<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.210> generally<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.290> since<00:02:04.530> you're

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hair color generally and so since you're

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
hair color generally and so since you're
giving<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.159> root<00:02:05.430> realness<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
giving it root realness you want it to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
giving it root realness you want it to
be<00:02:06.810> darker<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.860> even<00:02:08.069> our<00:02:08.160> wigs<00:02:08.399> need<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
be darker see even our wigs need a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.400 
be darker see even our wigs need a
change<00:02:09.090> every<00:02:09.360> once<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.750> while<00:02:09.780> she's<00:02:10.170> been

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
change every once in a while she's been

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
change every once in a while she's been
rocking<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> same<00:02:11.489> look<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:12.000> years

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
rocking the same look for years

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.100 
rocking the same look for years
everything

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
everything

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.150 
everything
going<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.410> well<00:02:13.500> ste<00:02:13.860> we're<00:02:14.010> already

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
going really well ste we're already

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.530 
going really well ste we're already
starting<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.760> some<00:02:14.940> really<00:02:15.120> good<00:02:15.300> color

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
starting to get some really good color

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.290 
starting to get some really good color
processing<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:17.100> not<00:02:17.310> too<00:02:17.730> deep<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.210> a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
processing there it's not too deep of a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.620 
processing there it's not too deep of a
route<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.100> enough<00:02:20.460> we're<00:02:20.970> headed<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
route but just enough we're headed to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.510 
route but just enough we're headed to
the<00:02:21.660> top<00:02:21.960> which<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.980> money<00:02:23.160> shot

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the top which this is your money shot

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.210 
the top which this is your money shot
you've<00:02:24.060> got<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> be<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:25.230> really<00:02:25.500> extra

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
you've got to be really really extra

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.120 
you've got to be really really extra
extra<00:02:26.580> extra<00:02:27.390> careful<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:28.860> even

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
extra extra careful here so I'm even

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.380 
extra extra careful here so I'm even
doing<00:02:29.520> less<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.320> just<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.700> lightest

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
doing less now just like the lightest

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.940 
doing less now just like the lightest
amount<00:02:33.600> because<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> hair<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.590> kind<00:02:34.920> of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
amount because the hair is kind of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.850 
amount because the hair is kind of
closer<00:02:35.310> together<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.990> your<00:02:37.590> roots

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
closer together up here so your roots

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.090 
closer together up here so your roots
will<00:02:38.100> sort<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.370> look<00:02:38.840> longer<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:41.040> too

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
will sort of look longer if you go too

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.820 
will sort of look longer if you go too
heavy-handed<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.270> I'm<00:02:42.420> being<00:02:42.720> very<00:02:43.260> very<00:02:43.500> very

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
heavy-handed so I'm being very very very

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.100 
heavy-handed so I'm being very very very
cautious<00:02:44.130> at<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.640> point<00:02:44.970> even<00:02:45.810> putting<00:02:45.990> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
cautious at this point even putting a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.990 
cautious at this point even putting a
little<00:02:46.320> bit<00:02:46.530> less<00:02:46.740> color<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> brush<00:02:47.550> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
little bit less color on the brush and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.730 
little bit less color on the brush and
then<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.720> want<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.990> kind<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.230> step<00:02:49.470> away<00:02:49.620> from

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
then you want to kind of step away from

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.380 
then you want to kind of step away from
your<00:02:50.010> work<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.459> when<00:02:50.610> I'm<00:02:50.700> doing<00:02:50.820> an<00:02:51.030> updo

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
your work like when I'm doing an updo

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
your work like when I'm doing an updo
and<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.750> make<00:02:51.930> sure<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.530> you're<00:02:53.280> getting

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
and just make sure that you're getting

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.790 
and just make sure that you're getting
everything<00:02:53.880> I'll<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.930> tap<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.410> hairline

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
everything I'll just tap that hairline

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.760 
everything I'll just tap that hairline
even<00:02:56.100> more<00:02:56.690> making<00:02:57.690> sure<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.200> kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.440> stain

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
even more making sure to kind of stain

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.440 
even more making sure to kind of stain
the<00:02:58.950> underneath<00:02:59.310> side<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.940> we're<00:03:00.420> not

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the underneath side of that we're not

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.830 
the underneath side of that we're not
giving<00:03:00.900> her<00:03:01.080> too<00:03:01.470> much<00:03:01.820> regrowth<00:03:02.820> just<00:03:03.450> enough

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
giving her too much regrowth just enough

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.990 
giving her too much regrowth just enough
to<00:03:04.020> make<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.350> believable<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.910> work

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
to make it believable and for it to work

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000 
to make it believable and for it to work
for<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.630> rock<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.140> ages'<00:03:07.440> video

for the rock of ages' video
I<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:09.030> promise<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.540> going<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.080> what

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I think promise is going to like it what

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.820 
I think promise is going to like it what
do<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.290> think

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.860 

the<00:03:17.460> final<00:03:17.910> detail<00:03:18.270> is<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.600> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> be

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the final detail is just going to be

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.470 
the final detail is just going to be
making<00:03:19.200> sure<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:20.010> you've<00:03:20.160> gotten<00:03:20.580> all<00:03:21.030> the

making sure that you've gotten all the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.200 
making sure that you've gotten all the
hairline<00:03:22.220> maybe<00:03:23.220> paint<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> other<00:03:23.970> way

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
hairline maybe paint it the other way

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.760 
hairline maybe paint it the other way
and<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.600> you've<00:03:25.170> stained<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.250> net<00:03:26.610> enough

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
and that you've stained the net enough

and that you've stained the net enough
to<00:03:28.770> cover<00:03:29.070> everything<00:03:29.490> because<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.300> don't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
to cover everything because you don't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.150 
to cover everything because you don't
want<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> light<00:03:30.900> net<00:03:31.170> popping<00:03:31.710> out<00:03:31.830> with<00:03:32.040> the
