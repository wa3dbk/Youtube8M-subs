this<00:00:09.750> afternoon<00:00:09.929> I've<00:00:10.290> got<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:11.929> micro-pearl

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
this afternoon I've got this micro-pearl

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.620 
this afternoon I've got this micro-pearl
core<00:00:13.349> braid<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.400> red<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:14.940> from<00:00:15.240> hair<00:00:15.450> line

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
core braid in red this is from hair line

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.349 
core braid in red this is from hair line
dubbing<00:00:16.020> first<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.240> in

the end it's rank create a very very
fine<00:00:23.660> pointed<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> year<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.660> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
fine pointed to the year to the the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.669 
fine pointed to the year to the the
braid<00:00:27.960> itself<00:00:29.480> then<00:00:30.480> they've<00:00:30.630> got<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> three

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
braid itself then they've got a three

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:41.680 
braid itself then they've got a three
mil<00:00:32.809> tungsten<00:00:33.809> bead<00:00:36.860> ideally<00:00:37.860> that's<00:00:38.640> right

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:53.180 

the<00:00:42.690> braid<00:00:45.140> through<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.829> tungsten<00:00:47.070> bead<00:00:52.190> I'm

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the braid through the tungsten bead I'm

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
the braid through the tungsten bead I'm
here<00:00:53.430> about<00:00:54.000> three<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.629> four<00:00:54.840> inches<00:00:55.110> long<00:00:55.289> by

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
here about three to four inches long by

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.740 
here about three to four inches long by
four<00:00:55.980> inches<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.780> just

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
four inches this one and then I'm just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.229 
four inches this one and then I'm just
on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.780> other<00:01:01.050> end

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
on the other end

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
on the other end
okay<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.280> three<00:01:05.280> Mel<00:01:05.489> tungsten

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
okay so there we have three Mel tungsten

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.960 
okay so there we have three Mel tungsten
bead<00:01:06.030> inside<00:01:08.240> what<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:10.159> they<00:01:11.159> braid<00:01:13.970> inside

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
bead inside what they they braid inside

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.410 
bead inside what they they braid inside
through<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.140> yeah<00:01:17.150> through<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> bead

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
through then yeah through the bead

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.580 
through then yeah through the bead
itself<00:01:18.810> okay<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.759> feeder<00:01:20.759> size<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.780> motor

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
itself okay so feeder size this a motor

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.270 
itself okay so feeder size this a motor
size<00:01:22.830> twelve<00:01:23.250> hook<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:24.030> feed<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> through

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
size twelve hook just feed that through

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
size twelve hook just feed that through
North<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> ton<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:26.670> advice<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.770> want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> do

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
North a ton some advice I want to do

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
North a ton some advice I want to do
find<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.490> these<00:01:29.729> things<00:01:30.140> do<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.619> have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
find is that these things do really have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.399 
find is that these things do really have
a<00:01:31.890> habit<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.280> actually<00:01:32.460> yeah<00:01:34.610> bunching<00:01:35.610> up

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
a habit of actually yeah bunching up

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.870 
a habit of actually yeah bunching up
I'll<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.470> holding<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.280> eye<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> catch

I'll be holding the eye if you catch

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.100 
I'll be holding the eye if you catch
your<00:01:39.030> fish<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.579> Tyson<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.960> knock

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.819 
your fish so I'm gonna Tyson you knock
some<00:01:43.320> cell<00:01:43.530> phone<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:44.299> pretty<00:01:45.299> tightly

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
some cell phone there pretty tightly

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.460 
some cell phone there pretty tightly
just<00:01:46.829> already<00:01:47.189> down<00:01:47.399> underneath<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.470> braid

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just already down underneath the braid

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.710 
just already down underneath the braid
down<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> bend

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:08.320 

what's<00:02:01.370> three<00:02:02.370> turns<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.660> do

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.500 

for<00:02:08.930> turn<00:02:10.270> two<00:02:11.270> finger<00:02:11.660> whip<00:02:11.810> finish<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.290> there

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
for turn two finger whip finish on there

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.880 
for turn two finger whip finish on there
go<00:02:14.510> through<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:15.490> I'm<00:02:16.490> just<00:02:16.850> gonna<00:02:16.910> use<00:02:17.180> some

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
go through that I'm just gonna use some

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.240 
go through that I'm just gonna use some
superglue<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:23.380> hold<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.620> right<00:02:25.010> in

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
superglue just to hold that right in

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.640 
superglue just to hold that right in
place<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.850> got<00:02:26.840> some<00:02:27.020> super<00:02:27.230> glue<00:02:27.350> just

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
place I got some super glue just

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.390 
place I got some super glue just
underneath<00:02:29.080> only<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.860> not<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.250> hook

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
underneath only it's not for the hook

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.210 
underneath only it's not for the hook
itself<00:02:32.020> besides<00:02:33.020> he's<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.620> actually<00:02:33.800> adding

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
itself besides he's not actually adding

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.780 
itself besides he's not actually adding
to<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.520> stiffness<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.360> yeah<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.550> fly

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
to the stiffness of the yeah of the fly

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.790 
to the stiffness of the yeah of the fly
itself<00:02:38.210> because<00:02:38.720> that's<00:02:41.260> all<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.590> ends

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
itself because that's all of the ends

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.230 
itself because that's all of the ends
here<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.510> still<00:02:44.510> really<00:02:44.990> mobile<00:02:45.590> flexible<00:02:46.240> that

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
here I still really mobile flexible that

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.860 
here I still really mobile flexible that
is<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.750> deadly<00:02:48.200> representation<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.690> blood

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
is a deadly representation of a blood

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.550 
is a deadly representation of a blood
work<00:02:52.720> absolutely<00:02:53.720> lethal<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.200> our<00:02:54.320> local

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
work absolutely lethal in our local

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.130
