00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
not what wasn't even it was it was

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.699 
not what wasn't even it was it was
intended<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.459> an<00:02:23.610> experiment<00:02:24.299> for

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
intended to be an experiment for

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.020 
intended to be an experiment for
xenoverse<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.070> battles<00:02:26.489> he<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.940> an

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
xenoverse so battles he was just an

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.610 
xenoverse so battles he was just an
experiment<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.660> went<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.959> little<00:02:28.140> too<00:02:28.260> deep

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
experiment they went a little too deep

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.290 
experiment they went a little too deep
in<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.069> my<00:02:29.280> opinion<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.849> was<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:29.970> in

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
in it in my opinion but it was just in

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.460 
in it in my opinion but it was just in
the<00:02:30.360> sphere<00:02:30.420> experiment

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the sphere experiment

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.420 
the sphere experiment
um<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.430> didn't<00:02:32.610> go<00:02:32.700> well<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.960> they

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
um it didn't go well but with they

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.260 
um it didn't go well but with they

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270
