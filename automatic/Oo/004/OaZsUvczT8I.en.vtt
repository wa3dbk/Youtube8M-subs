00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.800
 and so hello everyone with you in the footsteps for and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 today we talk about brushes what is it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.450
 such a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.990
 windshield wiper what is it for 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.470
 what do they need how to change them which is better 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.200
 to put 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.660
 brushes come in two relic types 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:36.000
 frameless here these here and frame 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.300
 they usually stood on old black and so 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.780
 further shorter what is the difference between 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 by them 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.739
 the first thing is that if you are framed 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.879
 brushes 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.620
 better to change them immediately to frameless 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.530
 why now let's see first 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.449
 that's what these brushes proved to be 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.580
 purify worse mustard gas with their rotation 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.670
 there is such a creak here or just 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.460
 creak iron for heard on camera or 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.100
 no, but this is unpleasant 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.650
 brushes without frame still does not have such 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 spoiler is made to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.230
 press the brushes to the glass during the wind 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.320
 but it is still jealous of 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.770
 and car dynamics but it happens that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.150
 oncoming flow at high speed 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.120
 it turns out between brushes glass 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.630
 there is an airbag that's from 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.480
 quality suffers 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.580
 wiping glass like that so they should 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.770
 be sure to be using though 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.950
 There are also carcasses and spoilers better 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 such they wipe better and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.560
 so on now let's try to figure it out 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.590
 how can I change the question of course 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.850
 trivia and but there are people who don't 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 know every brush there is such a 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.980
 Here is such a latch start and need 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 lift raise gently this element 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:10.830
 quite gentle and just unfasten 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.930
 we move this latch away then we hold 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.930
 hand and pull down 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.790
 and all the brush we removed easily and simply and not 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.849
 you need to sign up for auto repair what you 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.280
 where did you stripped a lot of money here 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.010
 then buy any brush in 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.889
 shop there by car or even on 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.799
 bazaar here they also have their time 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.920
 service and bet exactly the same only 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.879
 reverse order 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:56.349
 take insert insert it inside 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:03:02.129
 water and pull up and pull one 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:07.919
 hand just doing it is extremely uncomfortable 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:13.150
 see everything inside dad 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:18.359
 snapped here and then just on top 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:23.769

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:26.590
