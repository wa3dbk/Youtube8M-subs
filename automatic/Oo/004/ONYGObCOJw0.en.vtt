00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.350
 I am a new video of heroes the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.070
 youtuber who makes you hit bars 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.840
 so it's a coke and the slips you the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.109
 gamer it's going to cause I hope you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.300
 have the big fucking potatoes this corner 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'm really good this thing that breaks me 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.680
 candy that pisses me off it's at 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.880
 it's too hot guys 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 frankly we made this hideous film 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 he should clearly devote himself to me 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.490
 breaking the balls 2010 would be sacred to me 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 drunk in short is when everything was going 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 super of course today for 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.100
 episode 2 class carnage and I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.809
 wanted to do in the original point 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.620
 obviously original but at the same time 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.489
 powerful and you're really going 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.829
 so we are on the map 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.200
 Hydro works well fucking first 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 pack of maps I will not come anymore so 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 to be there often by rapine 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.550
 you are fast gameplay 5 minutes 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 so on both wheels outbid and 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.949
 now it is true that I have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.449
 a bit I'm a little tired of the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.050
 dominate without enough but really it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.430
 that that guys and times it's boring 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 phase so that they tighten 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.479
 we leave ourselves alone 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 is and then go see that it's going to be a 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.130
 good little gameplay not a huge score 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.909
 a little over 7 of ratio but that's 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.500
 just to show you the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.070
 characteristics of tears and what 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.380
 she is capable 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 to tell you that she is much more 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 that capable of what she did the end 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.369
 I could have done it's really a 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 time when we can do more than 100 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.979
 prague and with if we have a good team and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040
 younger wall opposite 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.530
 so this is so wish sinar mas 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.350
 burst an assault rifle that unlocks 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 to new photos and blocks 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 weapons toast and so much better besides 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.829
 so me I team with what so jmil 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.090
 reflex viewfinder with the ridiculous round and 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.460
 frankly I'm here to see but 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 with this one I have a better shoot 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.570
 is with this gun with tarrafal 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.220
 way it's so sure it's better 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.970
 to have a better shoot that's for sure 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 not going to lie to each other 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.329
 but here is a reflex viewfinder it's a bit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.250
 forgotten both because the viewfinder 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.170
 of origin is a little bit made in 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.119
 china his way without hiding me he a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.829
 little can and with that a lacrosse hours 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.719
 it is obligatory 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.280
 media since housing unama burst 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.560
 to be able to move while aiming it's 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.860
 really compulsory know if yes everything 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 right now 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.250
 guys touch me tears them all 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.069
 just upper body is a 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 burst almost all the time 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.079
 the guys full tilt they really 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.579
 finally this weapon is really great I 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.170
 discovered passion so much that you 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.959
 have seen capturing rael shot a burst 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.609
 Loans at the end of average loan 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.069
 worn as long-range 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.040
 its only fault is at short range 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.109
 that it is true that this is true then 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.760
 it's a little hot because its pace 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.659
 shooting is also not huge we 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.459
 it is true that he intends to plant it is a 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.989
 little hard face to face patrons it's 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.319
 still have grenade launchers close 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.069
 it's a little hot plays the rope but it 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.919
 it's possible it's not possible it's 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.099
 possible I avoid what with this class 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.209
 so it was phantom determination 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.199
 plunderers dexterity I think that like 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.120
 all weird now maybe 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.469
 dexterity finally I do not know very robust 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.060
 and I do not know you know my 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.379
 classes are the guys but I had 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.730
 to be really sturdy and spire I think 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.549
 could seal these two there everything you need 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.810
 have these 4 I present you more is 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.329
 really the equipment now tchit 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.180
 that they drop each colony since 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:10.819
 gastric 3d moderator not too much no 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.079
 plus the roannais micro stealth and group 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.310
 of hunting frankly what of grocery store which 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.439
 are very easy to drink with this 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.849
 always good weapon stay with them 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.229
 Guys in front was not super either 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.189
 good it's a gameplay I live alone 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.290
 and nobody with me 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.220
 and so here is so I advise you to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.319
 test this class because it is 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.419
 really cool cool cool cool cool cool 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.060
 it's really a class and frankly 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.379
 you're gonna go really why 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.879
 I did not say the not discovered rather 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.019
 star since she is really fair and 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.049
 normal you in a burst 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.310
 it's true that it depends on the times I 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.229
 I really took a good cause 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.359
 can have in two or even three 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:43.159
 burst but it's important that the 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.989
 mutinies it's true that both times jean 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.000
 the car has recovered no times it can 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.379
 be half burst as the limits 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.099
 burst to you whose gerard on the enemy 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.239
 it's a crazy thing 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.569
 while it is she is really 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.189
 regular you do not know me I know when 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.269
 I have to see the enemy so I know 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.769
 I stop to take it because I know 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.150
 that I see her I'm a burst the ad 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.049
 rue d'anjou you so that's cool 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.790
 which the Senate is putting to test on this 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.930
 visit the head earlier so I 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.129
 were doing evo blocks like flash in 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.229
 no more of that you're gonna have a burst 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.729
 so what does the smallest people want 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.139
 guys so here's the epithet of 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:16.099

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.079
 other than that yes here is my 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.389
 patent 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.539

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.740

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.139

 series do not trust time too much 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.509
 I'm trying to have fun because I know 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.680

 we announce the new consoles so 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.810
