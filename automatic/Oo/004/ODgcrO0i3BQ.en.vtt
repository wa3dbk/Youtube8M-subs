HE COMMITTED TO

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.390
WISCONSIN BEFORE HIS JUNIOR YEAR

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.860
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.130
NOW HE HAS EVOLVED

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.830
INTO ONE OF

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.460
THE BEST WISCONSIN BASKETBALL

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.830
PLAYERS THE FANS HAVE EVER

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.270

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.810
TOOK HIM TO KOHL CENTER STARTED

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.180
FROM THERE, THE BADGERS STORY

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.350
WAS BORN.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.480
SAM IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.250
HAS SOME UNIQUE SKILLS FOR HIS

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.520
SIZE.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.020
THAT CAN ENABLE HIM TO BE ONE

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.900
HECK OF A PLAYER.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.060
STEPHEN:

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.760
THREE YEARS LATER, HE

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.970
REMAINS THE KING OF THE COURT.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.370
I THINK I HAVE BEEN PLAYING

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.310
PRETTY WELL.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.480
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE BEST

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.180
BASKETBALL OF THE SEASON.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.880
I FEEL HEALTHY AND CONFIDENT.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.480
STEPHEN: THAT CONFIDENCE HAS

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.580
COME AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.150
SAM DEKKER IS AVERAGING MORE

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.620
THAN 21 POINTS PER GAME IN THE

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.020
NCAA TOURNAMENT.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.350
EIGHT BETTER THAN THE REGULAR

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.360
SEASON.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.710
I'M JUST LETTING THE GAME

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.430
COME TO ME, REALIZING I HAVE

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.830
SKILL AND CAN PLAY WITH ANYBODY.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.500
WHEN I DO THAT, I AM A LOT

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.630
BETTER AND MORE IN CONTROL.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.040
STEPHEN: HIS BACK-TO-BACK

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.970
PERFORMANCES ON THE WAY TO THE

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.440
FINAL FOUR OF THE CULMINATION OF

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.410
HIS DEVELOPMENT.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.350
HE JUST PRACTICES SO HARD.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.050
I THINK THAT HAS REALLY HELPED

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.750
HIS DEVELOPMENT AND BROUGHT IN

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.880
THE THINGS THAT WERE TRYING TO

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.090
DO, AND REALLY WORK ON THE

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.820
FOOTWORK, AND ALL THOSE SKILLS,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.790
BECAUSE THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.520
WILL MAKE YOU BETTER AND

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.820
QUICKER, ESPECIALLY AT A HIGHER

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.790
LEVEL.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.990
HE RUNS THE FLOOR

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.390
BETTER

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.890
DEFENSIVELY.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.000
HE ROTATES BETTER.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.700
HIS SHOTS AROUND THE RAM,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.000
FINISHED ON MORE OF THOSE THIS

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.670
YEAR.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.900
PROBABLY OF ALL THE

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.840
PLAYERS,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.870

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.140
ON HER TEACHING CLIPS DROPPED

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.880
80%.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.150
STEPHEN: HE HAS WON OVER THE

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.350
COACH, THE FANS, AND EVEN THE

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.080
NFL'S M.V.P. AARON RODGERS.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.150
NOW HE HAS A CHANCE TO CONTINUE

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.970
HIS LEGACY BY ENDING THE SEASON
