catching the Sun interestingly is only
going<00:00:10.450> to<00:00:10.510> be<00:00:10.600> visible<00:00:10.900> from<00:00:11.080> one<00:00:11.289> continent

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799

and today's so today's trivia question

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.820 
and today's so today's trivia question
is<00:00:14.469> what<00:00:14.770> continent<00:00:15.190> is<00:00:15.369> it<00:00:15.549> visible<00:00:15.879> from

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
is what continent is it visible from

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.960 
is what continent is it visible from
while<00:00:17.830> having<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.100> moon<00:00:18.279> in<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.520> way<00:00:18.609> the<00:00:18.789> Sun

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
while having the moon in the way the Sun

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.429 
while having the moon in the way the Sun
won't<00:00:19.150> seem<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.510> affect<00:00:19.600> very<00:00:20.019> much<00:00:20.199> the

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
won't seem to affect very much the

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.319 
won't seem to affect very much the
amount<00:00:20.619> of<00:00:20.740> activity<00:00:21.010> we<00:00:21.369> see<00:00:21.580> because

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
amount of activity we see because

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.669 
amount of activity we see because
there's<00:00:22.480> been<00:00:22.599> hardly<00:00:22.900> any<00:00:23.109> at<00:00:23.259> all<00:00:23.439> in<00:00:23.619> the

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
there's been hardly any at all in the

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.529 
there's been hardly any at all in the
last<00:00:23.740> 24<00:00:24.339> hours<00:00:24.369> just<00:00:25.210> a<00:00:25.300> few<00:00:25.449> minor<00:00:25.659> B<00:00:25.929> flares

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
last 24 hours just a few minor B flares

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.849 
last 24 hours just a few minor B flares
why<00:00:28.539> should<00:00:28.720> this<00:00:28.779> be<00:00:28.839> the<00:00:29.050> case<00:00:29.079> when<00:00:29.499> we<00:00:29.650> have

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
why should this be the case when we have

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.220 
why should this be the case when we have
two<00:00:30.699> regions<00:00:31.179> that<00:00:31.239> are<00:00:31.329> growing<00:00:31.720> on<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.989> disk

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
two regions that are growing on the disk

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.250 
two regions that are growing on the disk
let's<00:00:32.650> take<00:00:32.800> a<00:00:32.829> look<00:00:33.010> at<00:00:33.100> them<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:35.079> one

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
let's take a look at them well one

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.990 
let's take a look at them well one
problem<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.710> that<00:00:35.829> we<00:00:35.920> only<00:00:36.070> have<00:00:36.310> two<00:00:36.640> regions

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
problem is that we only have two regions

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.460 
problem is that we only have two regions
on<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.210> disc<00:00:37.390> at<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.600> moment<00:00:37.930> both<00:00:38.230> of<00:00:38.350> them

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
on the disc at the moment both of them

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.790 
on the disc at the moment both of them
are<00:00:38.530> in<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.770> northern<00:00:39.070> hemisphere<00:00:40.800> region

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
are in the northern hemisphere region

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.620 
are in the northern hemisphere region
1242<00:00:42.250> is<00:00:42.490> continued<00:00:42.880> to<00:00:43.000> grow<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.210> I'll<00:00:43.480> show

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
1242 is continued to grow and I'll show

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.030 
1242 is continued to grow and I'll show
you<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.780> more<00:00:43.990> detailed<00:00:44.350> movie<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:44.860> in<00:00:44.980> a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
you a more detailed movie of that in a

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.000 
you a more detailed movie of that in a
minute<00:00:45.190> on<00:00:46.000> 1243<00:00:46.600> seems<00:00:46.990> to<00:00:47.110> be<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.260> fairly<00:00:47.320> good

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
minute on 1243 seems to be a fairly good

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.340 
minute on 1243 seems to be a fairly good
region<00:00:48.370> too<00:00:48.610> so<00:00:49.540> he<00:00:49.660> reaches<00:00:49.960> enough<00:00:50.170> strong

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
region too so he reaches enough strong

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.810 
region too so he reaches enough strong
magnetic<00:00:50.680> field<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.160> are<00:00:51.310> changing<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
magnetic field and are changing and

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.570 
magnetic field and are changing and
that's<00:00:51.940> usually<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.330> formula<00:00:52.810> for<00:00:52.840> flares

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
that's usually a formula for flares

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.010 
that's usually a formula for flares
however<00:00:54.580> there's<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.180> third<00:00:55.420> element<00:00:55.630> that<00:00:55.960> I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
however there's a third element that I

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.660 
however there's a third element that I
haven't<00:00:56.200> discussed<00:00:56.560> before<00:00:56.920> which<00:00:57.160> requires

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
haven't discussed before which requires

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.910 
haven't discussed before which requires
flares<00:00:58.090> syllables<00:00:59.020> need<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.470> stressed

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
flares syllables need to be stressed

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.010 
flares syllables need to be stressed
when<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:00.940> look<00:01:01.090> at<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.270> x-ray<00:01:01.540> movie<00:01:01.840> later

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
when we look at the x-ray movie later

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.300 
when we look at the x-ray movie later
you'll<00:01:02.260> see<00:01:02.410> that<00:01:02.500> these<00:01:02.650> field<00:01:02.950> lines<00:01:03.010> don't

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
you'll see that these field lines don't

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.880 
you'll see that these field lines don't
look<00:01:03.550> particularly<00:01:03.910> stressed<00:01:04.740> here<00:01:05.740> is<00:01:05.799> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
look particularly stressed here is the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.800 
look particularly stressed here is the
48-hour<00:01:06.460> sunspot<00:01:06.970> movie<00:01:07.270> from<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.659> sto

48-hour sunspot movie from the sto
spacecraft<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:09.670> can<00:01:09.759> see<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> two<00:01:10.119> sunspot

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
spacecraft you can see the two sunspot

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.080 
spacecraft you can see the two sunspot
regions<00:01:10.870> slowly<00:01:11.140> developing<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.790> let's<00:01:12.970> take

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
regions slowly developing now let's take

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.570 
regions slowly developing now let's take
a<00:01:13.120> closer<00:01:13.480> look<00:01:13.600> at<00:01:13.900> region<00:01:14.200> 1242<00:01:14.830> as<00:01:15.370> it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
a closer look at region 1242 as it

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.810 
a closer look at region 1242 as it
develops<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:17.980> remember<00:01:18.250> yesterday<00:01:18.370> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
develops if you remember yesterday that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.420 
develops if you remember yesterday that
we<00:01:18.909> had<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.060> few<00:01:19.360> spots<00:01:20.070> gravitating<00:01:21.070> towards

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
we had a few spots gravitating towards

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.240 
we had a few spots gravitating towards
the<00:01:21.580> trailer<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.600> leader<00:01:22.750> region<00:01:23.229> they<00:01:24.040> will

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
the trailer and leader region they will

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.890 
the trailer and leader region they will
start<00:01:24.430> about<00:01:24.729> at<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.000> same<00:01:25.180> spot<00:01:25.390> but<00:01:25.750> you'll

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
start about at the same spot but you'll

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.170 
start about at the same spot but you'll
see<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.530> spots<00:01:27.490> developed<00:01:27.940> quite

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
see that the spots developed quite

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.270 
see that the spots developed quite
significant<00:01:28.870> there<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.200> is<00:01:29.320> 24-hour<00:01:29.740> period

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
significant there with is 24-hour period

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.980 
significant there with is 24-hour period
but<00:01:30.729> it's<00:01:30.880> slow<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.120> steady<00:01:31.510> growth<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.960> not

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
but it's slow and steady growth is not

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.550 
but it's slow and steady growth is not
explosive<00:01:32.740> growth

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
explosive growth

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.080 
explosive growth
you<00:01:33.979> see<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:34.250> tends<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.579> stress<00:01:34.909> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
you see what tends to stress the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.300 
you see what tends to stress the
magnetic<00:01:35.509> field<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.990> similar<00:01:36.619> story<00:01:36.829> is<00:01:37.040> told

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
magnetic field the similar story is told

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.670 
magnetic field the similar story is told
by<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.670> magnetic<00:01:38.210> movie<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.350> see<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
by the magnetic movie you see the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.870 
by the magnetic movie you see the
reasons<00:01:39.979> are<00:01:40.040> growing<00:01:40.220> stronger<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:40.700> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
reasons are growing stronger but the

days and that most of our bright regions
are<00:03:31.459> now<00:03:31.580> on<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.850> far<00:03:32.060> side<00:03:32.270> of<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.540> Sun<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.080> I

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
are now on the far side of the Sun so I

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.990 
are now on the far side of the Sun so I
scratch<00:03:34.069> solar<00:03:34.280> activity<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.760> remain

scratch solar activity to remain

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.970 
scratch solar activity to remain
relatively<00:03:35.390> low<00:03:35.660> for<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.930> next<00:03:36.140> few<00:03:36.260> days<00:03:36.440> as

relatively low for the next few days as

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.040 
relatively low for the next few days as
we<00:03:37.250> get<00:03:37.430> major<00:03:37.700> growth<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.239> those<00:03:38.360> two<00:03:38.630> regions

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
we get major growth in those two regions

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.979 
we get major growth in those two regions
or<00:03:39.170> some<00:03:39.380> new<00:03:39.500> regions<00:03:39.890> emerge<00:03:40.690> if<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.840> want

along with some of my videos on global

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.610 
along with some of my videos on global
warming<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.720> answer<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.140> question<00:03:54.260> as<00:03:54.590> to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
warming the answer to the question as to

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.470 
warming the answer to the question as to
which<00:03:54.860> conscience<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.670> partial<00:03:56.239> solar

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
which conscience the partial solar

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.270 
which conscience the partial solar
eclipse<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:57.049> we<00:03:57.170> visited<00:03:57.530> from<00:03:57.680> is

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
eclipse is then we visited from is

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.520 
eclipse is then we visited from is
Antarctica<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.989> if<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.140> want<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.350> see<00:04:00.500> that

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
Antarctica so if you want to see that

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.410 
Antarctica so if you want to see that
the<00:04:00.739> partial<00:04:00.980> eclipse<00:04:01.370> better<00:04:02.120> get<00:04:02.269> your

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
the partial eclipse better get your

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.600 
the partial eclipse better get your
skates<00:04:02.630> on<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.019> long<00:04:03.140> way<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.350> go<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:04.430> that's

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
skates on the long way to go so that's

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.670 
skates on the long way to go so that's
it<00:04:04.760> for<00:04:04.790> today<00:04:05.709> keep<00:04:06.709> safe<00:04:06.950> bye<00:04:07.430> for<00:04:07.640> now
