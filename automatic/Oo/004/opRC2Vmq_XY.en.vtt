00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.030 
you know it really does remind me of
those<00:02:13.959> blue<00:02:14.230> raspberry<00:02:14.470> ICS<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.630> you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
those blue raspberry ICS I think if you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.600 
those blue raspberry ICS I think if you
like<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.280> flavor<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:20.160> artificial<00:02:21.160> kind<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
like that flavor that artificial kind of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.120 
like that flavor that artificial kind of
blue<00:02:21.819> raspberry<00:02:22.120> flavor<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.200> get<00:02:23.350> in

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
blue raspberry flavor that you get in

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.490 
blue raspberry flavor that you get in
obviously<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.030> sees<00:02:25.300> but<00:02:25.420> also<00:02:25.569> candy<00:02:26.230> and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
obviously I sees but also candy and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.699 
obviously I sees but also candy and
other<00:02:26.970> similar<00:02:27.970> items<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:29.470> know<00:02:29.560> you'll

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
other similar items you know you'll

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:39.390 
other similar items you know you'll
probably<00:02:29.739> like<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.370> soda<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.790> lot<00:02:38.130> yeah<00:02:39.130> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
probably like this soda a lot yeah I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.220 
probably like this soda a lot yeah I
think<00:02:39.550> that's<00:02:39.880> definitely<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.780> case<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
think that's definitely the case and I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.070 
think that's definitely the case and I
think<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> good<00:02:41.940> type<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.090> change<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.930> pace

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
think it's a good type of change of pace

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.070 
think it's a good type of change of pace
soda<00:02:44.440> if<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.799> will<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:46.480> something<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:46.989> I

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
soda if you will not something that I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.229 
soda if you will not something that I

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
would drink all the time but certainly

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.559 
would drink all the time but certainly
something<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:50.459> tasty<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.910> really<00:02:52.390> do
