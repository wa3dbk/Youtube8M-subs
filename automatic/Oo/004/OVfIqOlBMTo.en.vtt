long to show you on this demonstration
but<00:00:16.800> here<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.449> wet<00:00:18.660> end<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.109> then

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
but here you have the wet end and then

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.230 
but here you have the wet end and then
the<00:00:19.590> motor<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.699> wet<00:00:20.910> end

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the motor the wet end

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
the motor the wet end
houses<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.050> impeller<00:00:22.380> which<00:00:22.680> moves<00:00:22.980> the

houses the impeller which moves the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.640 
houses the impeller which moves the
water<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.699> inside<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.930> wet<00:00:25.170> end<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
water and inside of this wet end is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.640 
water and inside of this wet end is
going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.599> shaft<00:00:27.840> seal<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.500> we're

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
going to be the shaft seal that we're

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.930 
going to be the shaft seal that we're
going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> replace<00:00:31.430> speed<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.700> process

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
going to replace speed up this process

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
going to replace speed up this process
here<00:00:33.570> there's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.140> screws<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.590> already

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
here there's a little screws are already

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
here there's a little screws are already
out<00:00:45.020> should<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.260> eight<00:00:46.500> screws<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.460> your

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
out should be about eight screws on your

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.000 
out should be about eight screws on your
wet<00:00:48.420> end<00:00:48.629> some<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> differ<00:00:55.010> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
wet end some are going to differ just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.670 
wet end some are going to differ just
about<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.570> sure<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
about got it so you be sure to have a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.939 
about got it so you be sure to have a
Phillips<00:00:59.489> screwdriver<00:00:59.940> along<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.350> couple

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
Phillips screwdriver along with a couple

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.980 
Phillips screwdriver along with a couple
of<00:01:02.010> flathead<00:01:02.579> screwdrivers<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.400> potentially

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
of flathead screwdrivers and potentially

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
of flathead screwdrivers and potentially
channel<00:01:06.990> locks<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.860> open<00:01:08.250> end<00:01:08.490> oil<00:01:08.820> can't

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
channel locks and an open end oil can't

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.140 
channel locks and an open end oil can't
wrench<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.409> reason<00:01:11.100> why<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.880> flat

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
wrench so reason why you need the flat

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
wrench so reason why you need the flat
and<00:01:12.799> screwdrivers<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> because<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.610> going

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and screwdrivers is because you're going

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
and screwdrivers is because you're going
to<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> pop<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> seal<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> wet<00:01:16.439> end

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to have to pop the seal on the wet end

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
to have to pop the seal on the wet end
sometimes<00:01:17.549> they'll<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> knob<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sometimes they'll be a knob here for you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.320 
sometimes they'll be a knob here for you
to<00:01:18.900> actually<00:01:19.020> kick<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to actually kick it out and then get a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
to actually kick it out and then get a
wedge<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.259> you're<00:01:22.409> able<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> start<00:01:23.040> getting

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
wedge on so you're able to start getting

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
wedge on so you're able to start getting
a<00:01:23.369> screwdriver<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.780> you'll<00:01:24.960> use

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
a screwdriver and then you'll use

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.570 
a screwdriver and then you'll use
another<00:01:25.439> screwdriver<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:26.070> towards<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
another screwdriver down towards the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
another screwdriver down towards the
other<00:01:26.790> end<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> work<00:01:28.049> yourself<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> way

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
other end and work yourself all the way

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.899 
other end and work yourself all the way
around<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.799> eventually<00:01:32.310> you'll<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.670> able<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
around and eventually you'll be able to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
around and eventually you'll be able to
pop<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> wet<00:01:34.079> end<00:01:34.259> off<00:01:35.869> as<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.320> right

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
pop the wet end off as you can see right

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
pop the wet end off as you can see right
behind<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> impeller<00:01:39.689> has

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
behind here is where the impeller has

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
behind here is where the impeller has
housed<00:01:40.290> am<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.060> we're<00:01:42.210> going

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
housed am and the way that we're going

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.149 
housed am and the way that we're going
to<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.780> impeller<00:01:43.079> off<00:01:43.350> would

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to have to get this impeller off would

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
to have to get this impeller off would
be<00:01:44.369> by<00:01:44.970> spinning<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> motor

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
be by spinning the back of the motor

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
be by spinning the back of the motor
around<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.860> again<00:01:47.100> using<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> flat-head

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
around and again using the flat-head

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.429 
around and again using the flat-head
screwdriver<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.780> will<00:01:49.670> take<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.149> cap

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
screwdriver you will take off this cap

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
screwdriver you will take off this cap
and<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.369> flat

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and as you can see there's a little flat

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.469 
and as you can see there's a little flat
head<00:01:54.079> spot<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.759> lock<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
head spot for this to lock on to that so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.440 
head spot for this to lock on to that so
we're<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> spin<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.619> around<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
we're going to spin this back around and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.850 
we're going to spin this back around and
stick<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> flat<00:02:00.840> head<00:02:01.020> screwdriver<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
back shaft of the motor and sometimes

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.730 
back shaft of the motor and sometimes
you're<00:02:05.880> lucky<00:02:06.090> enough<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.380> spin

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you're lucky enough to get this and spin

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770 
you're lucky enough to get this and spin
it<00:02:07.829> off<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.340> your<00:02:08.520> hand<00:02:08.819> sometimes

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it off with just your hand sometimes

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.029 
it off with just your hand sometimes
you're<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.649> your

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you're going to actually use your

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
you're going to actually use your
channel<00:02:11.280> locks<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.819> you're<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
channel locks and you're going to be

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
channel locks and you're going to be
very<00:02:13.080> gentle<00:02:13.500> when<00:02:13.620> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
very gentle when you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
very gentle when you
the<00:02:14.100> channel<00:02:14.370> locks<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.000> impeller

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the channel locks on the impeller

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.040 
the channel locks on the impeller
because<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.780> might<00:02:16.020> risk<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.900> fact<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
because you might risk the fact of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.750 
because you might risk the fact of
actually<00:02:19.440> snapping<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> impeller<00:02:20.430> off

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
actually snapping the impeller off

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.820 
actually snapping the impeller off
that's<00:02:21.510> why<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.840> comes<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.200> handy<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.650> an

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
that's why it comes in handy to have an

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.980 
that's why it comes in handy to have an
open<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.310> oil<00:02:24.060> cane<00:02:24.300> wrench<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> can

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
open and oil cane wrench so you can

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.240 
open and oil cane wrench so you can
actually<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> good<00:02:25.470> grip<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.100> has<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
actually get a good grip and has a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.650 
actually get a good grip and has a
rounded<00:02:26.790> edge<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.130> locks<00:02:29.130> there<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.540> in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
rounded edge on the locks there but in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.970 
rounded edge on the locks there but in
this<00:02:30.810> case<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.200> already<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.650> impeller

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
this case I already have the impeller

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
this case I already have the impeller
loose<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.910> video<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.660> can

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
loose for this video so that I can

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.960 
loose for this video so that I can
actually<00:02:33.990> show<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> can

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
actually show it to you and as you can

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.390 
actually show it to you and as you can
see<00:02:36.180> we've<00:02:36.510> got<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.930> back<00:02:37.500> end<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> shaft

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
see we've got the back end of the shaft

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.300 
see we've got the back end of the shaft
seal<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.120> actually<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> reverse<00:02:40.310> style

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310

seals<00:02:45.720> you'll<00:02:45.959> have<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> spring-loaded<00:02:47.450> shaft

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
seals you'll have a spring-loaded shaft

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.260 
seals you'll have a spring-loaded shaft
seal<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.440> will<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> impeller<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:51.180> in

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
seal that will be on the impeller but in

seal that will be on the impeller but in
this<00:02:51.360> case<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.870> called<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.140> reverse<00:02:52.440> shaft

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
this case it's called a reverse shaft

in the back of the wet end here that's
the<00:02:58.980> back<00:02:59.160> side<00:02:59.459> here<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.940> said<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.360> if

out<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:03.209> you'd<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.840> next<00:03:04.820> would<00:03:05.820> be

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
out what you'd have to do next would be

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.220 
out what you'd have to do next would be
to<00:03:06.000> take<00:03:06.330> out<00:03:06.800> four<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.890> these<00:03:08.010> bolts<00:03:08.370> here<00:03:09.230> all

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
to take out four of these bolts here all

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.060 
to take out four of these bolts here all
the<00:03:10.470> way<00:03:10.560> around<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:13.590> after<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.950> were

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
the way around and then after you were

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.310 
the way around and then after you were
to<00:03:14.280> take<00:03:14.430> those<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.880> you'd<00:03:15.300> pull<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
to take those out you'd pull off the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.000 
to take those out you'd pull off the
entire<00:03:16.650> wet<00:03:17.459> end<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:19.590> would<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.890> to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
entire wet end and we would have to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.680 
entire wet end and we would have to
knock<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.760> shaft<00:03:21.030> seal<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.450> with<00:03:21.660> a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
knock the shaft seal out with a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.030 
knock the shaft seal out with a
screwdriver<00:03:22.019> or<00:03:22.380> something<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:22.920> nature

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
screwdriver or something of that nature

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.970 
screwdriver or something of that nature
and<00:03:23.519> then<00:03:23.880> install<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.450> wet<00:03:24.630> end<00:03:24.810> back<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.290> but

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and then install the wet end back on but

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.170 
and then install the wet end back on but
in<00:03:26.070> this<00:03:26.130> case<00:03:26.370> we're<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:26.760> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.090> doing

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
in this case we're not going to be doing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.940 
in this case we're not going to be doing
that<00:03:27.450> today<00:03:27.630> we're<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.110> showing<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.680> how<00:03:28.920> to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
that today we're just showing you how to

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.750 
that today we're just showing you how to
take<00:03:29.880> shaft<00:03:30.480> seals<00:03:30.720> out<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.140> replace<00:03:31.560> them<00:03:31.799> so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
take shaft seals out and replace them so

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
take shaft seals out and replace them so
in<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.000> case<00:03:33.209> we've<00:03:33.450> got<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.780> shaft<00:03:34.019> seal

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
in this case we've got the shaft seal

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.500 
in this case we've got the shaft seal
here<00:03:36.049> times<00:03:37.049> you'll<00:03:37.230> need<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:38.000> tool<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.030> get<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
here times you'll need a tool to get the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.320 
here times you'll need a tool to get the
shaft<00:03:39.750> seal<00:03:40.470> out<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.459> you're<00:03:41.640> able<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.850> get<00:03:42.090> the

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
shaft seal out so you're able to get the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.699 
shaft seal out so you're able to get the
CLO<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.280> we've<00:03:44.489> got<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.820> impeller<00:03:45.709> we

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
CLO so that we've got the impeller we

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.949 
CLO so that we've got the impeller we
have<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.980> shaft<00:03:47.160> seal<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.239> now<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:48.840> we're

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
have the shaft seal so now what we're

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.600 
have the shaft seal so now what we're
going<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> do<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.500> obviously<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.310> shaft

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
going to do is obviously get the shaft

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.240 
going to do is obviously get the shaft
seal<00:03:50.820> back<00:03:51.030> into<00:03:51.299> place<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.440> wasn't<00:03:52.830> doing<00:03:53.040> so

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
seal back into place so wasn't doing so

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.420 
seal back into place so wasn't doing so
just<00:03:54.200> reverse<00:03:55.200> specs<00:03:55.560> what<00:03:55.860> we<00:03:56.010> already<00:03:56.280> did

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
just reverse specs what we already did

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.180 
just reverse specs what we already did
and<00:03:56.670> before<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.540> install<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.290> shaft<00:03:58.920> seal

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
and before you install the shaft seal

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.170 
and before you install the shaft seal
you<00:04:00.030> want<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.299> get<00:04:00.420> your<00:04:00.600> o-ring<00:04:00.959> lube<00:04:02.180> so

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you want to get your o-ring lube so

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.289 
you want to get your o-ring lube so
you're<00:04:03.360> able<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.630> make<00:04:03.870> sure<00:04:04.790> your<00:04:05.790> gasket

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
you're able to make sure your gasket
