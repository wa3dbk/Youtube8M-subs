 today we have to review it to Me 600 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.180
 we look at this bike we should 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.000
 meet the owner this one 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.350
 owner 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.789
 Well, tell me about what year 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.640
 motorcycle minutes for 3 years as in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.610
 came from Italy to us last year 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 Krasnodar from there brought him here and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.489
 here I bought it my friend as 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 I would like to be very pleased with the purchase 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.489
 still tell the question price the price question 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.539
 Well, you can say from 100 to 200 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 something like this 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.190
 within the wax around you already in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.190
 I have time 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 honestly somewhere in the month of July 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.620
 and during this time something has changed on 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.480
 little things up to the backside did not know there 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:19.780
 adjustment candles are not a bow 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.090
 so basically we will be the same 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 in the same condition in the same 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.960
 nothing was painted nothing 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.530
 changed in general so pretty what 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.920
 power 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.950
 power just can not just right back 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.070
 about 100 horses somewhere 98 105 here 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.210
 Something between this fluctuates 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.840
 the documents didnâ€™t look too honest 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.720
 saying duck brakes are ventilated and not 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.790
 rear disc brakes 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.180
 than model honda cbr 600 f 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.690
 f it was originally it was pure 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.150
 sport 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.770
 then he was transferred to the tourist class and 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:05.660
 it is considered a sport-tourist so this 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.470
 explain it with us 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.450
 the shock absorber here costs gas oil 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.020
 here is this shock absorber shock absorber there under 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.540
 sitting he gazomaslyany exactly doubled 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 the tank is the gas here is the mode 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.340
 adventure harder softer regulated 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.200
 rear suspension also adjustable 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.959
 front suspension is also harder on the fork 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.940
 balls such moments for a comfortable ride 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.770
 or for driving in sport mode, but sports 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.650
 interesting to buy this one 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.650
 motorcycle need any equipment 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.010
 for yourself or you can go in whatever you want 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.660

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.810
 yes, the helmet is surely right here just 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.330
 surely the helmet of course need gloves 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.480
 if something happens so as not to hurt your hands 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.390
 to keep your hands safe and desirable 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.500
 of course jacket pants well but what and no 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.400

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.400
 skin 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.019
 some kind of carbonic yes it's real 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.900
 carbon that is it is a factory back 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:18.959
 wing yes this is a real carbon so rubber 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.439
 native tires yes we can say that 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.920
 regular standard rubber size 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.480
 road not track vani no rain 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.950
 standard rubber 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.129
 custom exhaust like shit exhaust 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.310
 remus screaming very loudly but we sweat it 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.419
 Head acceleration to 100 to skolki and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.780
 how many seconds 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:47.310
 approximate with a second or a trip 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.930
 said again this second and i think three 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.540
 three and a half falls right without 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.540
 problems for this year seems to me 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.290
 well preserved and not painted yes 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:06.150
 nothing in it is not particularly well, as there is nothing to 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.239
 small things there is well it's understandable twenty 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.540
 over the years as a knife can be 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.540
 so 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.819
 let's see how it starts 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.819

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.300
