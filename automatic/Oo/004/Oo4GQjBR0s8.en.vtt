to clean up on that right leaf I put a
medium<00:01:34.430> layer<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.390> it'll<00:01:35.689> have<00:01:35.810> small

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
medium layer so it'll have small

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.020

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.920 
thicker layer so it will have big
crackles<00:01:40.430> that's<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.090> best<00:01:41.570> things

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
crackles that's one of the best things

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.530 
crackles that's one of the best things
about<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.350> paint<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.799> it's<00:01:43.400> one<00:01:43.610> step<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.390> get

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
about this paint is it's one step to get

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.710 
about this paint is it's one step to get
the<00:01:44.659> crackles<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.290> then<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.270> also<00:01:47.450> do

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
the crackles and then you can also do

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.080 
the crackles and then you can also do
small<00:01:47.960> crackles<00:01:48.320> or<00:01:48.470> big<00:01:48.650> big<00:01:49.310> crackles<00:01:49.759> it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
small crackles or big big crackles it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.179 
small crackles or big big crackles it
will<00:01:50.450> level<00:01:50.780> off<00:01:50.900> on<00:01:51.140> its<00:01:51.290> own<00:01:51.439> on<00:01:51.740> those<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
will level off on its own on those the

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.560 
will level off on its own on those the
end<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.520> thick<00:01:52.729> part<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.150> you<00:01:53.180> can<00:01:53.330> see<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
end that thick part but you can see the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.190 
end that thick part but you can see the
difference<00:01:53.960> here<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:56.509> clean<00:01:56.689> up<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:56.990> craft

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
difference here to clean up on the craft

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.620 
difference here to clean up on the craft
sheets<00:01:57.470> easy<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.040> just<00:01:58.070> use<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> wet<00:01:58.939> t<00:01:59.360> old

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
sheets easy you just use a wet t old

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.490 
sheets easy you just use a wet t old
t-shirt<00:02:00.079> or<00:02:00.350> rag<00:02:00.619> or<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.299> let<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.930> dry<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
t-shirt or rag or you can let it dry and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.219 
t-shirt or rag or you can let it dry and
just<00:02:03.680> scrape<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.070> right<00:02:04.250> off<00:02:04.430> it's<00:02:04.640> easy<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:05.060> do

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
just scrape it right off it's easy to do

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.699 
just scrape it right off it's easy to do
okay<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.290> always<00:02:07.009> let<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.929> crackle<00:02:08.929> paint<00:02:09.110> dry

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
okay so always let the crackle paint dry

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.559 
okay so always let the crackle paint dry
on<00:02:09.860> its<00:02:09.890> own<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.610> about<00:02:10.700> five<00:02:11.060> minutes<00:02:11.300> before

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
on its own for about five minutes before

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.350 
on its own for about five minutes before
you<00:02:12.200> start<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.340> zap<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.730> with<00:02:13.760> heat

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
you start to zap it with heat

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.320 
you start to zap it with heat
I<00:02:15.070> can<00:02:16.070> assure<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.120> let<00:02:17.300> it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
I can assure you that if you let it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.750 
I can assure you that if you let it
crack<00:02:17.630> on<00:02:17.810> its<00:02:17.990> own<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.530> dry<00:02:18.860> over<00:02:19.160> time<00:02:19.370> it'll

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
crack on its own and dry over time it'll

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.210 
crack on its own and dry over time it'll
be<00:02:20.000> much<00:02:20.300> better<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.650> see<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:22.070> to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
be much better but you can see here to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.770 
be much better but you can see here to
the<00:02:22.310> right<00:02:22.490> how<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.910> cracks<00:02:23.270> are<00:02:23.510> coming

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the right how the cracks are coming

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.180 
the right how the cracks are coming
along<00:02:23.870> faster<00:02:24.410> because<00:02:24.500> i'm<00:02:24.650> using<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.010> heat

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
along faster because i'm using a heat

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.010 
along faster because i'm using a heat
gun<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.970> better<00:02:26.210> not<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.480> use<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> heat<00:02:26.990> gun

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
gun it's better not to use a heat gun

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.720 
gun it's better not to use a heat gun
but<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:27.560> you're<00:02:27.710> patient<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.280> me<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.700> can

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
but if you're patient like me you can

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.610 
but if you're patient like me you can
zap<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.450> gun<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.990> help<00:02:30.140> things<00:02:30.410> move

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
zap it with a gun to help things move

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.580 
zap it with a gun to help things move
along<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.600> here's<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> close-up<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.380> those

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
along so here's a close-up of those

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.140 
along so here's a close-up of those
leaves<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.100> can<00:02:34.250> see<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> one<00:02:34.730> on<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.940> left

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
leaves you can see the one on the left

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.170 
leaves you can see the one on the left
has<00:02:35.270> some<00:02:35.630> bigger<00:02:36.260> cracks<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:38.000> one

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
has some bigger cracks to it and the one

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.330 
has some bigger cracks to it and the one
on<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> right<00:02:38.420> has<00:02:38.630> smaller<00:02:39.500> cracks<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.220> it

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
on the right has smaller cracks to it

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.190 
on the right has smaller cracks to it
now<00:02:41.030> here's<00:02:41.300> one<00:02:41.450> with<00:02:41.570> really<00:02:41.810> big<00:02:41.930> cracks

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
now here's one with really big cracks

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.690 
now here's one with really big cracks
because<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:42.860> very<00:02:43.070> thick<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.459> I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
because I put it on very thick and I

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.070 
because I put it on very thick and I
zapped<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.060> with<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.209> heat<00:02:44.450> gun<00:02:44.480> because<00:02:44.930> I'm

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
zapped it with a heat gun because I'm

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.990 
zapped it with a heat gun because I'm
impatient<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.740> get<00:02:45.920> those<00:02:46.040> deep<00:02:46.370> cuts<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
impatient so you get those deep cuts and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.090 
impatient so you get those deep cuts and
then<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.750> rub<00:02:48.080> some<00:02:48.320> paint<00:02:48.560> over<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.830> which<00:02:48.980> I'll

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
then I rub some paint over it which I'll

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.949 
then I rub some paint over it which I'll
show<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.580> minute<00:02:49.700> here's<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.750> good

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
show you in a minute here's a good

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.979 
show you in a minute here's a good
example<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:52.180> heavier<00:02:53.180> layer<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.780> paint

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
example this is a heavier layer of paint

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.510 
example this is a heavier layer of paint
and<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> thinner<00:02:54.770> layer<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.130> paint<00:02:55.340> so

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
and this is a thinner layer of paint so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.040 
and this is a thinner layer of paint so
you<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.730> see<00:02:55.880> how<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.030> can<00:02:56.150> get<00:02:56.300> two<00:02:56.660> very

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
you can see how you can get two very

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.370 
you can see how you can get two very
different<00:02:57.650> looks<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.220> crackle<00:02:58.670> paints

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
different looks with the crackle paints

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.350 
different looks with the crackle paints
this<00:03:00.380> one<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.550> butterfly<00:03:01.880> where<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.090> put

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
this one is just a butterfly where I put

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.199 
this one is just a butterfly where I put
on<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.840> pretty<00:03:03.830> thin<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.160> medium<00:03:04.580> layer<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:05.000> paint

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
on a pretty thin a medium layer of paint

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.360 
on a pretty thin a medium layer of paint
and<00:03:05.510> I'm<00:03:06.470> heating<00:03:06.770> with<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.920> heat<00:03:07.040> gun<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.310> you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
and I'm heating with a heat gun so you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.030 
and I'm heating with a heat gun so you
can<00:03:07.520> see<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.820> cracks<00:03:08.090> taking<00:03:08.570> form<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.140> did<00:03:10.010> a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
can see the cracks taking form I did a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.830 
can see the cracks taking form I did a
few<00:03:10.250> butterflies<00:03:10.459> like<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.630> I'm<00:03:11.720> going

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
few butterflies like this and I'm going

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.229 
few butterflies like this and I'm going
to<00:03:11.930> show<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.170> how<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.500> can<00:03:12.620> enhance<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
to show you how you can enhance the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.970 
to show you how you can enhance the
crackle<00:03:14.780> effect<00:03:15.170> with<00:03:16.209> paint<00:03:17.209> dabbers<00:03:17.980> so
