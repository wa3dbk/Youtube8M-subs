for those different motor types the
first<00:00:22.050> clipper<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.770> talk<00:00:22.920> about

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
first clipper we're going to talk about

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.070 
first clipper we're going to talk about
is<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> magnetic<00:00:23.910> motor<00:00:24.150> clipper<00:00:24.510> you'll

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
is the magnetic motor clipper you'll

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.420 
is the magnetic motor clipper you'll
know<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> magnetic<00:00:25.980> motor<00:00:26.160> clipper

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
know it's a magnetic motor clipper

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.349 
know it's a magnetic motor clipper
because<00:00:26.670> you'll<00:00:26.789> hear<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> four-letter

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
because you'll hear that four-letter

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.730 
because you'll hear that four-letter
click<00:00:29.960> every<00:00:30.960> time<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> turn<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> motor<00:00:31.680> on
