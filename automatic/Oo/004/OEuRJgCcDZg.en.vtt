00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.319
 and better and supervision than commenting 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.180
 today I bring you a totally rejects 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.919
 rice practically so he tells me 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.630
 playing with a mega team that was 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.180
 we said an objective team of youtube 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.890
 we were playing then black alpha and 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.630
 serious and I mean the mega team 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.700
 printing would win a couple more but good 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.200
 and it came out this streak is really 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 playing quite dry doing a little 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.050
 the retarded as he is watching getting 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.850
 puntitos my colleagues is worse 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 playing with the reason back and the truth 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 that I had a very cool streak 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.770
 had guardadita around here is not a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 nuclear but that is a streak of more 30 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.070
 because you have to also tell what 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 killed with the missile vital gesture and with a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.310
 guardian that I get in the package but 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 good if you come looking for a nuclear 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.149
 pressure you have seen and yes you take me out 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.220
 a nuclear that is marking the 30 weapon 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.840
 you have it in the description in the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.680
 second line so well then he stopped 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.120
 background this streak that to me 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 I particularly liked it more than the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 nuclear simply because it is much more 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.460
 to like much faster and also because 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 It's fine because I'm using gusts 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 I take apart from the reform that the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.680
 erreka of the soil is pretty cool the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.969
 I did not like that streak because it 's not 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 stop killing this map the truth you 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.020
 It suits me I love this map because it's 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 a sensitive enough agile since you in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.920
 the sense of size more or less not that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.840
 so chic is a little smaller is that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 the super close answers you are interested 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.850
 it's totally the game all the time 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 killing you fans so I love no 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.000
 I know I love this map and the games 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.799
 more than I have I have them on this map not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 So, well, as you know, it has 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 vacation could not enjoy more than 34 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.850
 days of the beta on pc 4 on xbox one ni 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 he has not even been able to play but well 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.399
 to give my opinion on this piece of 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.229
 departure 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.640
 I do not know about what has 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.899
 seemed the game in general at the moment 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.819
 the beta is not obviously saving the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.530
 distance from the subject of the of the 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.209
 connection that there were the servers that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.409
 they went wrong and all that obviously is a 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.630
 beta and that you have to understand it is not a 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.069
 game let's say official if it's a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.110
 test version which they take it out 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.489
 to use errors and you have to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.799
 thank you for doing it because really 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:49.380
 this makes then the theme of the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.959
 connection do not pass or spend less in the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 official game not really because 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.810
 we imagine that this leaves the game and if 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.489
 this happens and nobody can play against 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
 the desire and the truth is that 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.689
 could very much not so apart from for 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.429
 avoid the issue of failures and all that 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.780
 they fix the connection and such, so I 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.610
 it seems right that they have done the beta 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.929
 and then servando at distances we go to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940
 comment on the game that I thought 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.490
 the game 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.720
 I have loved it sincerely 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.060
 as the most warfare I like quite 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.710
 but there are many people who do not see it as 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 a lame really not the good thing that they have 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.690
 warfare is that it allows you to do many 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.160
 things in plan jump and I do not know I mean 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.690
 that is to be able to refuse a lot 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
 contain other call of duty in this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.260
 we have a feint that is the subject 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.140
 we have the theme of what is the name of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.060
 the good of the mail by the walls and 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.920
 to be able to walk while scaling 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.630
 while shooting if all that and the truth 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.160
 is that there are people who say that they 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.350
 it seems a lot to me really does not seem 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.030
 well in the forefront is much more let's 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.440
 to say in frantic quotes from 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.000
 use the suit the jumps and all that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.320
 that this game is not good but for example 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.810
 this map the truth is that it is a pass 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.610
 I really mean it's a mix 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.780
 between black ops 1 for example of sting and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.250
 is mind in some destiny touch with 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.450
 the skills and such am in a game that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.640
 I like it, not because he ordered the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.500
 skills and you do it well it 's useful comes out 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.940
 well you feel like super good 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.260
 with yourself you do not say cool finished 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.810
 mess up kiko the skill that my mother 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 like as the cast then I do not know to me 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.960
 It's a game that I like a lot because 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.760
 apart is that I do not know if you do not have 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.010
 example this happens with him does not happen with the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.420
 golf I mean you are all the time 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.650
 finding that people do not either 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.760
 boring for example game set 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.930
 hot and not 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.610
 because I'm always finding myself 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.110
 people are always killing me not so 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.420
 other modes for example by teams or 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.620
 domain depends as with the enemies it 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.390
 they are usually a little slower 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.700
 if you put a game mode and a map 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.890
 genetic this game is the support that is 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 you are all the time killing you die 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.650
 Like me what I like is to kill 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.480
 die and kill die and either with or to 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.099
 make fun examples like this in general 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.299
 I liked the game and I'm waiting 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.069
 very anxious, at least he has 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.049
 beta the final game to see what 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.940
 such weapons are balanced so they balance 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.349
 weapons and will fix the connection and everything 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.790
 those kids so good here is 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.680
 just the streak is a shame because I 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.209
 I'm looking for a lot to kill this guy came to me 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.409
 the skirt and it kills me so in fact already 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.730
 liked the video leave your likes 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.730
