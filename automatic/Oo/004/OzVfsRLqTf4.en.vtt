00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.270
 we continue with the series of tutorials that 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 I had commented on the previous video 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.120
 of silky skin in this case I told you that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.770
 I was going to teach you how to make eyes and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 the largest mouth in a very 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 simple then once we have 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.910
 the open photography we can if 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 we want to double it to be able to work 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.690
 about the copy and we come to a loop 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.260
 and we are going to make a selection of the eye 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.450
 approximately around here 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.380
 with the loop 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.590
 and now we will give the icon where they can 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.390
 add selection and so we will select 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.390
 both eyes at the same time 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 that we have the selection made we come to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.170
 the selection tab and we'll search 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 modify and we will give it to fade 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.049
 and here we are going to give you for example five 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.640
 pitchers or seven radio from the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.040
 dawn I lie and we accept 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.290
 we recommend the selected layer we're going 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.070
 to give it a jot control so that here 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.500
 above , do not let us see that 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.560
 we have opened you do not panic 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.530
 for this layer of here this you see here 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.170
 this is from the previous tutorial follow that 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.799
 Do not worry 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.940
 and about the layer that we have of the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:43.090
 eyes if we give you a control t 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.540
 and right button we will give you to climb 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.460
 and as we have done a fade 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.940
 we will be able to go up the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.190
 scale of the eyes of our 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.320
 photography to the size that we consider 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.880
 let's do a little bit bigger like that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.230
 for example, it can be quite 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.380
 all right 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.850
 and mouth we will do the same to us 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.350
 We place in the mouth area good 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.910
 first of all let's see the before and the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.710
 after 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.330
 having the biggest eyes and we 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.580
 we place in the layer below to 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.340
 select the mouth and we go to the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.420
 loop tool and let's make a 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 mouth selection 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.390
 and we do the same thing that we have done 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.830
 previously we saw a selection 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.470
 modify fade and we will leave the 7 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.730
 fading pixels that we had 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.300
 before by element and now with control 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.600
 j 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.750
 we have here a layer we give to 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.490
 control ter 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.320
 right button scales and we extend both 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.040
 above and below always 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.030
 trying to maintain a proportion and 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.310
 and we make the mouth bigger 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.920
 and as well we can observe I do not know 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.610
 absolutely nothing that we have 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.380
 modified the mouth so I note it what 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.520
 we would notice if we hide for a moment the 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.450
 layer we see the mouth of before and that of 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.250
 Then, just like the eyes, let's see 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.040
 the before and after if we want to see 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.270
 the effect will better position ourselves for 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.230
 here for example 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.970
 before 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.330
 after 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.160
 before then very well then this is a 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.020
 tutorial in the following tutorial 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.030
 we will learn a technique to make up 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.310
 the eyes in a pretty way 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.490
 simple and so we will go creating 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.050
 tutorials for photo retouching very 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.470
 well see you soon in the next 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.470
 tutorial
