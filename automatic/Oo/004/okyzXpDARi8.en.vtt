 I can not wcc today 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.219

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.640
 d's elastically 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.120
 This is a classic I'm Milan year 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.550
 I wonder if Brazil is different from lining up 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.750

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.820
 I will kill you 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.570
 Teach even the left center back tier 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.350
 This is the quietness of cutting 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.890
 This probably it is the act 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.110
