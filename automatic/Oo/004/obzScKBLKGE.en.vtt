00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
which teams were looking for so let's go

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.679 
which teams were looking for so let's go
ahead<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.570> reset<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> depth<00:00:19.199> charts<00:00:23.600> for<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.620 
depth chart to total here I'm gonna get

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
into the team selection just a little

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
into the team selection just a little
bit<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> certainly<00:00:28.800> don't<00:00:29.010> mean<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
bit but I certainly don't mean to

bit but I certainly don't mean to
foreshadow<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:30.119> all

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
foreshadow at all

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.269 
foreshadow at all
the<00:00:31.439> Seahawks<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> demonstrate

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the Seahawks here to demonstrate

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
the Seahawks here to demonstrate
literally<00:00:32.850> every<00:00:33.180> single<00:00:33.210> attribute<00:00:33.870> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
literally every single attribute that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
literally every single attribute that
we've<00:00:34.170> talked<00:00:34.469> about<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.920> both<00:00:35.190> sides<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
we've talked about on both sides of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.069 
we've talked about on both sides of the
ball<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> great<00:00:36.540> example<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.020> how

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
ball so they make a great example of how

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.290 
ball so they make a great example of how
to<00:00:37.200> properly<00:00:37.440> set<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> depth<00:00:38.219> chart<00:00:38.489> up

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
to properly set up a depth chart up

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
to properly set up a depth chart up
first<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> quarterback<00:00:40.350> position<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
first is a quarterback position and the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
first is a quarterback position and the
QB<00:00:41.460> attributes<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.030> spoke<00:00:42.300> about<00:00:42.329> where<00:00:42.719> speed

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
QB attributes we spoke about where speed

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
QB attributes we spoke about where speed
throw<00:00:43.770> power<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.430> throw<00:00:44.760> accuracy<00:00:45.480> what's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
throw power and throw accuracy what's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.690 
throw power and throw accuracy what's
interesting<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> Seahawks<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
interesting about the Seahawks is that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.799 
interesting about the Seahawks is that
they<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> three<00:00:48.360> capable

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
they actually have three capable

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.170 
they actually have three capable
quarterbacks<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.379> each<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.680> categories

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
quarterbacks in each of these categories

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.459 
quarterbacks in each of these categories
matt<00:00:51.180> flynn<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.140> slower<00:00:52.320> than

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
matt flynn is a little bit slower than

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.630 
matt flynn is a little bit slower than
the<00:00:52.559> other<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:52.800> quarterbacks<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.399> certainly

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the other two quarterbacks but certainly

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720 
the other two quarterbacks but certainly
a<00:00:53.730> 76<00:00:54.270> feet<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> respectable<00:00:55.309> divorce<00:00:56.309> Jackson

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
a 76 feet is respectable divorce Jackson

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
a 76 feet is respectable divorce Jackson
Russel<00:00:56.969> Wilson<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.300> neck-and-neck<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.750> speed

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
Russel Wilson are neck-and-neck in speed

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.450 
Russel Wilson are neck-and-neck in speed
but<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.440> eliminate<00:00:58.620> Jackson<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
but we could eliminate Jackson from this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
but we could eliminate Jackson from this
race<00:00:59.670> due<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> his<00:01:00.120> throw<00:01:00.390> accuracy<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
race due to his throw accuracy when it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.290 
race due to his throw accuracy when it
all<00:01:01.980> boils<00:01:02.160> down<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> throwing<00:01:02.910> accuracy

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
all boils down to throwing accuracy

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
all boils down to throwing accuracy
between<00:01:03.480> Flynn<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.229> Wilson<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.309> two<00:01:05.460> are

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
between Flynn and Wilson the two are

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
between Flynn and Wilson the two are
pretty<00:01:05.850> even<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.689> difference<00:01:07.049> between<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
pretty even the difference between the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
pretty even the difference between the
two<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.740> significant<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> throw<00:01:08.700> power<00:01:08.939> by

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
two is significant and throw power by

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
two is significant and throw power by
Russell<00:01:09.510> Wilson<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.530> course<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> speed

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
Russell Wilson and of course the speed

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
Russell Wilson and of course the speed
that<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.250> spoke<00:01:11.520> about<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.390> money<00:01:12.659> here

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that we spoke about so for my money here

that we spoke about so for my money here
Russell<00:01:13.200> Wilson<00:01:13.500> gets<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> start<00:01:15.500> up<00:01:16.500> next<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the running back position here and this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
the running back position here and this
is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:18.720> horse<00:01:18.900> race<00:01:19.259> between<00:01:19.470> Marshawn

here<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.009> personal<00:01:41.430> preference

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
here but that's just personal preference

here but that's just personal preference
I<00:01:42.030> don't<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.630> terribly<00:01:42.899> wrong

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
