 sugar what you would catch up 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.490
 that's why it blasts calories 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.000
 namely, will stand just as well 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.900

 hille sugar said still really nice 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.110
 taste like a good aroma 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.110
 get on track 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:55.340
 no problem I already wore 4 so 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.680
 We do not have that good pack 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.620
 I have to say I have to develop 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:07.150
 can do better with a lax 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.150
 to tear then come now going 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:27.530
 open 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:32.560
 that complicates everything in it's ok 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.560
 it's the account 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:53.660
 so did the spoon a bit 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.060
 as the latter mixa resembles but I want 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.730
 me now here all the cat cacau 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.120
 then the worries about a stop wanted 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:10.280
 that's why folk kauder flies above 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:12.200
 first so resorted only just outside 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.770
 interest is finally color of 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.770
 sun sit 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.160
 Now we're finally starting 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.170
 so we can slow for the animal 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.990
 expose more there because there is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.590
 This horny this horny mousse au 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.030
 fold chocolat bernrain and then there 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.030
 plus a few carbohydrates 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:49.980
 so are synonymous in the external image 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:37.789
 so people then breaks the nice creamy 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.199
 consistency 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.409
 that is now in the fridge will be cold 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.970
 put a few hours need that 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.409
 then that's a really nice thing 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.340
 if it is solid then you can eat 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:52.759
 so always nice mixa wants with the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.740

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.900

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.949
 is fixed and that will be really good 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.330
