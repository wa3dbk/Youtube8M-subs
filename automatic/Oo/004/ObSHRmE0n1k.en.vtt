hi my name is Chris in this video is an

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.900 
hi my name is Chris in this video is an
experiment<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:07.290> prime<00:00:07.710> numbers<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.519> ran

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
experiment with prime numbers that I ran

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.640 
experiment with prime numbers that I ran
on<00:00:09.420> Excel<00:00:09.990> using<00:00:11.059> VBA<00:00:14.570> now<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.900> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> start

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
on Excel using VBA now I want to start

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.890 
on Excel using VBA now I want to start
by<00:00:16.830> saying<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:17.279> not<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> professional

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
by saying that I'm not a professional

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.849 
by saying that I'm not a professional
mathematician<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:18.990> anything<00:00:19.199> I'm<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.619> a

dabbler I've always been interested in

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.250 
dabbler I've always been interested in
prime<00:00:22.890> numbers<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.080> I<00:00:25.080> decided<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
prime numbers and I decided to

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.970 
prime numbers and I decided to
experiment<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:29.330> prime<00:00:30.330> numbers<00:00:30.980> moving

experiment with prime numbers moving
about<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.860> two-dimensional<00:00:34.860> area<00:00:35.390> their

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
about a two-dimensional area their

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
about a two-dimensional area their
movement<00:00:36.870> based<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.070> difference<00:00:38.610> between

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
movement based on the difference between

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
circle on the lower left now the basis I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.789 
circle on the lower left now the basis I
used<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.409> movement<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:24.020> pattern<00:01:25.020> based<00:01:25.470> on

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
used for movement was pattern based on

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
used for movement was pattern based on
the<00:01:26.009> difference<00:01:26.369> between<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> prime<00:01:27.960> number

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the difference between the prime number

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
the difference between the prime number
in<00:01:28.350> question<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.759> previous<00:01:30.210> prime

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
in question and the previous prime

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.260 
in question and the previous prime
number<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.259> difference<00:01:31.619> between<00:01:31.770> them

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
number and the difference between them

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
number and the difference between them
for<00:01:33.270> example<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.460> look<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> bottom

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
for example if you look at the bottom

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.620 
for example if you look at the bottom
that<00:01:36.390> 5<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.680> 2<00:01:38.369> greater<00:01:38.700> than<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.240> previous

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that 5 is 2 greater than the previous

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.499 
that 5 is 2 greater than the previous
prime<00:01:39.930> number<00:01:40.229> 3<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> two

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
prime number 3 so that's the two

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.380 
prime number 3 so that's the two
difference<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.170> means<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> arrow

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
difference which means that the arrow

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
difference which means that the arrow
moves<00:01:45.390> upwards<00:01:46.130> now<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:48.680> 1111<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
moves upwards now if you look at 1111 is

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.800 
moves upwards now if you look at 1111 is
4<00:01:50.130> greater<00:01:50.280> than<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.909> previous<00:01:51.119> prime<00:01:51.509> number

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
4 greater than the previous prime number

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.340 
4 greater than the previous prime number
7<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.500> which<00:01:52.710> case<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.220> difference<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.640> 4<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
7 in which case the difference is 4 and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
7 in which case the difference is 4 and
the<00:01:55.350> arrow<00:01:55.710> moves<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> left<00:01:56.790> 6<00:01:57.630> moves<00:01:57.869> down

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the arrow moves to the left 6 moves down

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.520 
the arrow moves to the left 6 moves down
and<00:01:58.500> 8<00:01:58.799> moves<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> right

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and 8 moves to the right

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
and 8 moves to the right
so<00:02:02.100> based<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.550> pattern<00:02:02.760> of<00:02:03.450> movement

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so based on this pattern of movement

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.940 
so based on this pattern of movement
I<00:02:04.610> had<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.030> numbers<00:02:06.720> moving<00:02:07.170> around<00:02:07.440> each

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I had the numbers moving around each

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
I had the numbers moving around each
other<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:09.420> pattern<00:02:09.869> however<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.320> didn't<00:02:10.590> want

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
other in a pattern however I didn't want

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.990 
other in a pattern however I didn't want
to<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> overlap<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:13.160> well<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.550> example<00:02:14.640> if

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
to have overlap so well for example if

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.220 
to have overlap so well for example if
we<00:02:15.150> start<00:02:15.210> with<00:02:15.620> 37<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:18.030> picture<00:02:18.300> you'll

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
we start with 37 on this picture you'll

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.030 
we start with 37 on this picture you'll
see<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.840> couldn't<00:02:22.260> move<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> lower

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
see that it couldn't move in the lower

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.460 
see that it couldn't move in the lower
space<00:02:23.459> from<00:02:23.820> 31<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.140> was<00:02:25.230> already

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
space from 31 because it was already

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
space from 31 because it was already
occupied<00:02:25.680> by<00:02:25.890> 23<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.840> simply<00:02:28.110> had<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
occupied by 23 so I simply had the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.960 
occupied by 23 so I simply had the
motion<00:02:30.390> jump<00:02:30.750> any<00:02:31.050> existing<00:02:31.620> numbers<00:02:31.970> until

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
motion jump any existing numbers until

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.860 
motion jump any existing numbers until
it<00:02:33.120> hit<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.600> first<00:02:33.840> free<00:02:34.140> space<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.770> then

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
it hit the first free space and then

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.470 
it hit the first free space and then
populated<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.459> 31<00:02:38.970> jumped<00:02:39.390> down<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:40.200> 37

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
populated there so 31 jumped down to 37

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.020 
populated there so 31 jumped down to 37
skipping<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.630> two<00:02:42.810> numbers<00:02:43.170> below<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:44.030> so

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
skipping the two numbers below it so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.560 
skipping the two numbers below it so
using<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.480> basic<00:02:45.750> pattern<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:47.390> created<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
using this basic pattern I created the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.690 
using this basic pattern I created the
larger<00:02:48.930> overall<00:02:49.230> pattern<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.670> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
larger overall pattern this is a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.800 
larger overall pattern this is a
close-up<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.959> earlier<00:02:52.709> numbers<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.810> as

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
close-up of the earlier numbers and as

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.860 
close-up of the earlier numbers and as
you<00:02:55.739> see<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.520> move<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.390> general<00:02:57.690> direction

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you see they move in a general direction

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.130 
you see they move in a general direction
from<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.040> left<00:03:00.020> indicating<00:03:01.020> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
from right to left indicating a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
from right to left indicating a
predominance<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.280> number<00:03:02.550> 4<00:03:03.860> if<00:03:04.860> for

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
predominance of the number 4 if for

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.259 
predominance of the number 4 if for
example<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:07.290> number<00:03:07.920> between<00:03:08.519> two<00:03:09.030> prime

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
example the number between two prime

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.840 
example the number between two prime
numbers<00:03:09.299> was<00:03:09.870> larger<00:03:10.410> than<00:03:10.860> 8<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.400> example<00:03:11.790> if

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
numbers was larger than 8 for example if

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.930 
numbers was larger than 8 for example if
it<00:03:12.000> was<00:03:12.030> 12<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.769> would<00:03:13.920> simply<00:03:14.100> subtract<00:03:14.670> 8

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
it was 12 then I would simply subtract 8

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.699 
it was 12 then I would simply subtract 8
until<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.390> had<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> number<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.170> was<00:03:16.320> 8<00:03:16.530> or

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
until I had a number that was 8 or

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.300 
until I had a number that was 8 or
smaller<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.420> would<00:03:18.570> use<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.780> number

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
smaller and then I would use that number

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.699 
smaller and then I would use that number
so<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.489> example<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.780> had<00:03:21.959> 1<00:03:22.170> prime<00:03:22.410> number

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
so for example if you had 1 prime number

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.400 
so for example if you had 1 prime number
that<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:22.950> 12<00:03:23.220> greater<00:03:23.519> than<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> previous

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
that was 12 greater than the previous

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.009 
that was 12 greater than the previous
then<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.950> would<00:03:26.310> use<00:03:26.459> 4<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:30.060> using<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.600> overall

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
then I would use 4 so using this overall

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.830 
then I would use 4 so using this overall
pattern<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.820> generated<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:32.970> picture

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
pattern I generated this picture

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.960 
pattern I generated this picture
starting<00:03:34.799> from<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.190> right<00:03:35.489> upper<00:03:35.760> hand

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
starting from the right upper hand

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.550 
starting from the right upper hand
corner<00:03:36.060> where<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> red<00:03:36.690> circle<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.260> and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
corner where the red circle is and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.650 
corner where the red circle is and
moving<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.370> sweeping<00:03:38.820> wave-like<00:03:39.239> pattern

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
moving in the sweeping wave-like pattern

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.030 
moving in the sweeping wave-like pattern
down<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.650> lower<00:03:41.489> left<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:43.650> thought<00:03:43.890> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
down to the lower left and I thought it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.979 
down to the lower left and I thought it
was<00:03:44.100> interesting<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:45.060> large<00:03:45.360> predominance

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
was interesting the large predominance

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.039 
was interesting the large predominance
of<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.590> number<00:03:46.860> 4<00:03:47.180> appearing<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.690> overall

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
of the number 4 appearing in the overall

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.850 
of the number 4 appearing in the overall
pattern<00:03:49.459> as<00:03:50.459> also<00:03:50.760> seems<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.329> slight

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
pattern as also seems to be a slight

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.310 
pattern as also seems to be a slight
predominance<00:03:52.860> for<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.070> number<00:03:53.340> 6<00:03:54.320> indicated

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
predominance for the number 6 indicated

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.040 
predominance for the number 6 indicated
by<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> general<00:03:56.010> downward

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
by a general downward

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.740 
by a general downward
and<00:03:59.050> I<00:03:59.770> would<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.550> interested<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:01.209> seeing<00:04:01.510> how

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
and I would be interested in seeing how

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.199 
and I would be interested in seeing how
this<00:04:02.170> pattern<00:04:02.440> plays<00:04:02.830> out<00:04:03.100> on<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.340> much<00:04:03.430> larger

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
this pattern plays out on a much larger

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.980 
this pattern plays out on a much larger
scale<00:04:05.100> with<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.160> longer<00:04:06.730> list<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.300> numbers<00:04:07.720> I

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
scale with a longer list of numbers I

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.250 
scale with a longer list of numbers I
only<00:04:08.709> use<00:04:09.340> this<00:04:09.550> up<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:11.010> roughly<00:04:12.510> 10,000<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:13.900> I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
only use this up to roughly 10,000 so I

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.590 
only use this up to roughly 10,000 so I
would<00:04:15.040> be<00:04:15.130> interested<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.550> see<00:04:15.760> if<00:04:16.329> this

would be interested to see if this

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.560 
would be interested to see if this
