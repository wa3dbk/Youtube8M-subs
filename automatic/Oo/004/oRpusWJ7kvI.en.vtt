in this video I'll show you some upper

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.390 
in this video I'll show you some upper
back<00:00:02.460> exercises<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.659> these<00:00:04.560> are<00:00:04.740> bodyweight

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
back exercises and these are bodyweight

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.110 
back exercises and these are bodyweight
dumbbell<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.450> barbell<00:00:07.440> exercises<00:00:07.820> but<00:00:08.820> let's

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
dumbbell and barbell exercises but let's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.930 
dumbbell and barbell exercises but let's
start<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:10.230> bodyweight<00:00:10.769> exercises<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
start with the bodyweight exercises and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.200 
start with the bodyweight exercises and
these<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:12.809> pull-ups<00:00:13.769> basically<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
these are all pull-ups basically so the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.480 
these are all pull-ups basically so the
first<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.719> normal<00:00:16.470> crip<00:00:16.800> pull-up<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
first one is normal crip pull-up and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.210 
first one is normal crip pull-up and
this<00:00:18.420> means<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.560> shoulder

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
this means that you have a shoulder

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.269 
this means that you have a shoulder
width<00:00:20.609> apart<00:00:20.850> grip<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> little<00:00:22.470> bit<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:23.010> or

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
width apart grip or a little bit more or

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.359 
width apart grip or a little bit more or
less<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.019> simply<00:00:25.019> pull<00:00:25.560> yourself<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
less and simply pull yourself up and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.330 
less and simply pull yourself up and
lower<00:00:26.670> yourself<00:00:27.210> next<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> wide<00:00:28.980> grip

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
lower yourself next one is a wide grip

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.359 
lower yourself next one is a wide grip
pull<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.289> it's<00:00:31.289> basically<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.920> same<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pull up and it's basically the same as a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790 
pull up and it's basically the same as a
normal<00:00:32.610> grip<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.960> time<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.559> have

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
normal grip but this time you will have

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.970 
normal grip but this time you will have
a<00:00:35.280> wider<00:00:35.610> grip<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.649> bar

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
a wider grip and you can see that my bar

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.569 
a wider grip and you can see that my bar
is<00:00:38.219> slightly<00:00:38.550> bent<00:00:39.030> which<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:40.309> take<00:00:41.309> away<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is slightly bent which can take away a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.490 
is slightly bent which can take away a
little<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.180> stress<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:44.000> wrists<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
little bit of stress of your wrists and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.760 
little bit of stress of your wrists and
finally<00:00:46.500> these<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.730> Close<00:00:48.629> Grip

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
finally these are the Close Grip

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.189 
finally these are the Close Grip
pull-ups<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.789> some<00:00:51.120> exercises<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
pull-ups there are some exercises in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
pull-ups there are some exercises in
this<00:00:52.559> video<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> didn't<00:00:53.670> share<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.360> for

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this video that I didn't share one for

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.500 
this video that I didn't share one for
example<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> pulldown<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.489> requires<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
example is a pulldown which requires a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
example is a pulldown which requires a
special<00:00:58.050> machine<00:00:58.410> which<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.920> will<00:00:59.129> find<00:00:59.460> in

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
special machine which you will find in

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
special machine which you will find in
the<00:00:59.760> gym<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.690> says<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the gym that says I don't have one of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.969 
the gym that says I don't have one of
those<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.940> simply<00:01:03.870> show<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> exercise

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
those I will simply show the exercise

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.399 
those I will simply show the exercise
that<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> baseball

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that I can do so this is the baseball

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
that I can do so this is the baseball
grip<00:01:07.710> exercise<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.760> make<00:01:09.090> sure<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
grip exercise and make sure that you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
grip exercise and make sure that you
ultimate<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> crip<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.580> when<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ultimate the crip so when you are

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.550 
ultimate the crip so when you are
lifting<00:01:13.189> with<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.220> left<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.810> go

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
lifting with your left and you will go

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
lifting with your left and you will go
to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> left<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> bar<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.630> you're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
to the left of the bar and if you're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.800 
to the left of the bar and if you're
pulling<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.159> hand<00:01:20.400> behind<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pulling with your right hand behind the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
pulling with your right hand behind the
left<00:01:22.320> hand<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.130> pull<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:23.970> head<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
left hand you will pull your head to the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.679 
left hand you will pull your head to the
right<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.680> next<00:01:25.890> exercise<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.450> white

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
right so the next exercise is a white

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.140 
right so the next exercise is a white
creep<00:01:28.080> pull-up<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.490> will<00:01:29.520> go

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
creep pull-up but this time you will go

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
creep pull-up but this time you will go
to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.509> left<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to the left and go to the right so you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
to the left and go to the right so you
will<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.869> stress<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.500> one

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
will put a little bit more stress on one

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.670 
will put a little bit more stress on one
side<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.490> your<00:01:35.820> upper<00:01:36.299> back<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:37.380> than<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
side of your upper back more than the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.160 
side of your upper back more than the
other<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.360> bodyweight

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
other and this is a good bodyweight

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
other and this is a good bodyweight
exercise<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.400> another

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
exercise that you can do another

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.170 
exercise that you can do another
variation<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.740> white<00:01:44.100> creep<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.700> one

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
variation with the white creep is one

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.109 
variation with the white creep is one
hand<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.350> pull<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.860> position<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.939> other

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
hand in a pull up position and the other

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.780 
hand in a pull up position and the other
hand<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.200> Chinna<00:01:49.500> position<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.579> left

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
hand in the Chinna position so the left

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
hand in the Chinna position so the left
hand<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.329> chin<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.470> hand<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.040> in

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
hand is in chin up and right hand is in

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.200 
hand is in chin up and right hand is in
pull-up<00:01:53.610> position<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.460> circle

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
pull-up position and this is a circle

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.080 
pull-up position and this is a circle
pull-up<00:01:57.990> which<00:01:58.710> requires<00:01:59.369> quite<00:01:59.820> some

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
pull-up which requires quite some

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
pull-up which requires quite some
strength<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.920> suited<00:02:02.850> for

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
strength and it's not really suited for

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.870 
strength and it's not really suited for
beginners<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.930> keep<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.770> mind<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
beginners so keep that in mind if you
