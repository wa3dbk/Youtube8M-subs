I<00:00:14.950> became<00:00:15.950> interested<00:00:16.400> in<00:00:16.430> marine<00:00:16.610> biology

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
I became interested in marine biology

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.250 
I became interested in marine biology
from<00:00:17.090> about<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.450> age<00:00:17.570> of<00:00:17.720> seven

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
from about the age of seven

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.140 
from about the age of seven
I'll<00:00:18.440> see<00:00:18.650> every<00:00:18.890> holiday<00:00:19.160> with<00:00:19.670> getting<00:00:20.030> ice

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
I'll see every holiday with getting ice

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.060 
I'll see every holiday with getting ice

rocks and learning all the names of
things<00:00:23.750> when<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:24.740> first<00:00:25.070> joined<00:00:25.160> bass<00:00:25.580> before<00:00:25.880> I

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
things when I first joined bass before I

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.730 
things when I first joined bass before I
went<00:00:26.300> south<00:00:26.539> had<00:00:26.780> comprehensive<00:00:27.470> training

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
went south had comprehensive training

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.410 
went south had comprehensive training
learning<00:00:28.400> all<00:00:28.520> about<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.850> Antarctic

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
learning all about the Antarctic

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.050 
learning all about the Antarctic
advanced<00:00:30.140> first<00:00:30.470> aid<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.250> also<00:00:31.400> dentistry

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
advanced first aid and also dentistry

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.910 
advanced first aid and also dentistry
because<00:00:32.689> also<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.079> in<00:00:33.200> a<00:00:33.260> very<00:00:33.380> remote<00:00:33.710> place

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
because also you in a very remote place

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.530 
because also you in a very remote place
it's<00:00:34.489> very<00:00:34.610> hard<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.880> get<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.120> out<00:00:35.300> especially

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's very hard to get you out especially

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
camping on the island with just one

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.620 
camping on the island with just one
other<00:00:40.100> person<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:40.910> if<00:00:41.060> they<00:00:41.210> get<00:00:41.360> into<00:00:41.600> trouble

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
other person so if they get into trouble

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.560 
other person so if they get into trouble
I'm<00:00:42.440> their<00:00:42.710> first<00:00:42.980> call<00:00:43.220> of<00:00:43.340> help<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:44.390> get

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
I'm their first call of help so you get

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.180 
I'm their first call of help so you get
trained<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:44.960> almost<00:00:45.290> everything<00:00:45.829> that<00:00:46.040> you

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
trained in almost everything that you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.260 
trained in almost everything that you
need

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.119 

so<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:53.300> work<00:00:53.600> on<00:00:53.780> South<00:00:54.050> Georgia<00:00:54.079> we<00:00:54.890> have<00:00:55.039> to

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
so I work on South Georgia we have to

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.650 
so I work on South Georgia we have to
get<00:00:55.280> there<00:00:55.460> by<00:00:55.579> ship<00:00:55.879> from<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.210> Falkland

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
get there by ship from the Falkland

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.590 
get there by ship from the Falkland
Island<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.309> my<00:00:58.309> research<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.789> predominantly

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
Island and my research is predominantly

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.229 
Island and my research is predominantly
on<00:00:59.719> fur<00:01:00.170> seals<00:01:00.559> but<00:01:01.129> I<00:01:01.250> work<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.699> team<00:01:01.940> that

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
on fur seals but I work in a team that

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.039 
on fur seals but I work in a team that
also<00:01:02.449> looks<00:01:02.870> at<00:01:03.050> penguins<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.800> an<00:01:04.250> albatross

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
also looks at penguins and an albatross

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.120 
also looks at penguins and an albatross
what<00:01:06.049> we're<00:01:06.170> trying<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.500> do<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.710> build<00:01:06.890> up<00:01:07.009> a

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
what we're trying to do is build up a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.830 
what we're trying to do is build up a
picture<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.700> these<00:01:07.820> animals<00:01:08.300> where<00:01:08.810> they

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
picture of these animals where they

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.780 
picture of these animals where they
forage<00:01:09.350> at<00:01:09.470> sea<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.830> how<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.040> populations

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
forage at sea and how the populations

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.190 
forage at sea and how the populations
doing<00:01:11.000> where<00:01:11.300> they're<00:01:11.450> increasing<00:01:12.080> or

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
doing where they're increasing or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:39.820 
doing where they're increasing or
decreasing<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:37.899> lab<00:01:38.899> work<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:39.259> do<00:01:39.409> in<00:01:39.560> South

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
decreasing the lab work we do in South

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.919 
decreasing the lab work we do in South
Georgia<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:40.580> pretty<00:01:40.880> basic<00:01:41.119> we<00:01:41.600> only<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:41.869> a

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
Georgia is pretty basic we only have a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.870 
Georgia is pretty basic we only have a
very<00:01:42.140> small<00:01:42.409> laboratory<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.340> I'll<00:01:43.520> bring<00:01:43.789> a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
very small laboratory so I'll bring a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.730 
very small laboratory so I'll bring a
lot<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.060> samples<00:01:44.539> back<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.960> Cambridge<00:01:45.200> where<00:01:45.710> I

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
lot of samples back to Cambridge where I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.499 
lot of samples back to Cambridge where I
can<00:01:45.979> do<00:01:46.100> much<00:01:46.310> more<00:01:46.520> sophisticated<00:01:47.149> DNA

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
can do much more sophisticated DNA

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.889 
can do much more sophisticated DNA
analysis<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.409> genetics<00:01:49.069> and<00:01:49.580> also<00:01:50.060> fatty<00:01:50.479> acid

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
analysis of genetics and also fatty acid

research<00:01:54.979> feeds<00:01:55.460> into<00:01:55.670> government<00:01:56.360> policy

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
research feeds into government policy

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.649 
research feeds into government policy
which<00:01:57.320> then<00:01:57.710> helps<00:01:58.430> sustainable<00:01:59.210> fisheries

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
which then helps sustainable fisheries

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.260 
which then helps sustainable fisheries
in<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.350> Antarctic<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.399> then<00:02:01.640> don't<00:02:01.969> damage

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
in the Antarctic that then don't damage

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.549
