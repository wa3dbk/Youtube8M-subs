00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.730
 the alcorcón happened to the third round of 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.630
 the cup of his majesty the king 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.349
 running over the mallorca in the iberostar 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.759
 I stayed three days after his match 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.739
 of league forward the two teams 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.750
 they staged a very different shock 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.489
 with many titular players in the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.029
 bench or even out of the 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.140
 call were the substitutes 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.739
 some of the alternates of the alcor with 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.570
 those who could with the set also 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.719
 of not habitual of the mallorca although already 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.430
 in the second part some 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.719
 of its most important players this is 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.219
 the first goal of the match we had 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.949
 seen a ball to the wood of the Japanese 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.670
 here for the mallorca but dani pacheco 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.560
 I would not forgive in the 22nd minute 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.420
 and I would write the 0 to 1 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.530
 a ball he receives in the midfield 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.530
 get a diagonal 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:09.020
 takes several players from mallorca and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.970
 final can not but stop at 11 the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 alcorcón that in this way beat the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.240
 goalkeeper rubén boy 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.619
 Majorca attempts from outside the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.619
 area to surprise the goalkeeper 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.369
 dani jiménez stretched his arms but he 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.530
 marched that ball the mallorca with something 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.850
 of disorder in attack but looking 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.850
 dial from outside the area 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.430
 and submit quickly to the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.380
 party and not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.890
 have to live a second goal that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.990
 it would end up coming for the people of Madrid 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 that were very comfortable with less 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.330
 possession but coming out on the backlash 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.180
 this is the action from 0 to 2 in which 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.610
 Oscar Flat manages to shoot on goal 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.619
 Ruben Miño's clearance takes advantage 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.250
 antonio martínez for coming from 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.250
 second line 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.380
 shoot the Majorcan goalkeeper here 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.260
 we see how it hits with the right a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.189
 ball that does not even touch the ground 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.420
 02 for an alcorcón that put land of 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.430
 through 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.709
 in this day copera in the iberostar 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
 I was second ball to the post for the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.870
 mallorca who was not lucky in the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.750
 first minute 44 minute the most player 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.830
 unbalancing alfaro ends up seeing 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.709
 true to the way he touches her 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.660
 goalkeeper came with 0 2 at rest 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.280
 with some whistles already by the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.640
 Mallorquinist fans that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 accentuated with the action of 0 to 3 a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 very comfortable goal 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.190
 to solve that play to throw plane 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.190
 excellent ball 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.460
 to space with the advance defense of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.540
 Majorca 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.760
 and with kirk and playing the role of 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.250
 assistant to make plane with the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.470
 left 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.380
 consider the 0 to 3 will be the 9 minute of 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.490
 the second half and therefore the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.800
 alcorcón that this time already took a lot 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.870
 advantage in the marker and left 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.970
 practically sentenced this party and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.590
 the tie 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.280
 it still did more damage the set of 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.960
 Miguel Álvarez with 0 to 4 before another 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.140
 time from the outside it proved the whole 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.140
 vermilion 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.590
 he did it for the mallorca pedro bigas that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.360
 they had replaced the injured cheromei 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.400
 and this is the error 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.960
 kevin who is not able to refuse that 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.670
 ball takes it to pacheco and ends 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.670
 leather for delivering again 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.540
 oscar plane the one in charge of executing 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.220
 point guard in addition to the goalkeeper 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.090
 mallorquinista rubén miño and score the 0 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.099
 to 4 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.989
 in the 20th minute of the second half if 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.330
 the 0 to 3 had left the shock 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.700
 sentenced on 04 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.310
 it was already definitive although he had time 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.720
 still the game to see a single goal 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.290
 one last goal that of gerard 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.330
 Moreno who entered the second half 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.880
 and with this shot from afar and from 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.920
 the peak of the area would get cut 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.260
 distances by the way I had marked 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.450
 in the league match the two goals that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.010
 they gave victory to mallorca front 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.290
 alcorcón the Madrid set that is 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.420
 he led a very strong victory and 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.420
 goes to the third round of the cup at 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.620
 final victory for a goal to four of 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.620
 alcorcón in mallorca
