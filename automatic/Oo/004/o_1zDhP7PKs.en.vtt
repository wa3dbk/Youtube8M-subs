actually need a nerf and how big of one
didn't<00:00:51.470> need<00:00:51.620> if<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.860> did<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.250> i<00:00:53.000> think<00:00:53.240> it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
didn't need if it did and i think it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.690 
didn't need if it did and i think it
needed<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.720> very<00:00:54.050> slight<00:00:54.530> one<00:00:54.770> I<00:00:54.800> think<00:00:55.160> more<00:00:55.460> so

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
needed a very slight one I think more so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.850 
needed a very slight one I think more so
other<00:00:55.970> guns<00:00:56.270> needed<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.840> be<00:00:56.960> buffed<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.440> a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
other guns needed to be buffed and a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.460 
other guns needed to be buffed and a
couple<00:00:58.070> did<00:00:58.400> including<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.210> em1<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.840> X<00:01:00.050> mgs

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
couple did including the em1 and X mgs

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.540 
couple did including the em1 and X mgs
which<00:01:00.650> we<00:01:00.770> might<00:01:00.920> talk<00:01:01.070> about<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.310> little<00:01:01.430> bit

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
which we might talk about a little bit

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.670 
which we might talk about a little bit
later<00:01:01.790> but<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:02.660> do<00:01:02.750> believe<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.350> needed<00:01:03.620> a

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
later but I do believe it needed a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.340 
later but I do believe it needed a
slight<00:01:04.100> nerf<00:01:04.460> not<00:01:04.850> too<00:01:05.150> big<00:01:05.329> of<00:01:05.390> one<00:01:05.600> recall

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
slight nerf not too big of one recall

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.260 
slight nerf not too big of one recall
isn't<00:01:06.679> a<00:01:06.710> very<00:01:06.859> big<00:01:07.100> one<00:01:07.280> I'm<00:01:07.460> glad<00:01:08.119> they

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
isn't a very big one I'm glad they

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.539 
isn't a very big one I'm glad they
didn't<00:01:08.509> affect<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.409> damage<00:01:09.859> or<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.100> range<00:01:10.340> on

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
didn't affect the damage or the range on

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.300 
didn't affect the damage or the range on
it<00:01:10.729> at<00:01:10.880> all<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.210> if<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.079> look<00:01:12.319> at<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.829> recoil

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
it at all and if you look at the recoil

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.239 
it at all and if you look at the recoil
it<00:01:13.490> seems<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.909> be<00:01:14.060> all<00:01:14.299> vertical<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:16.009> don't

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
it seems to be all vertical and I don't

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:17.770 
it seems to be all vertical and I don't
think<00:01:16.369> that's<00:01:16.520> very<00:01:16.640> hard<00:01:16.999> to<00:01:17.090> control<00:01:17.359> i<00:01:17.479> just

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
think that's very hard to control i just

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.330 
think that's very hard to control i just
think<00:01:17.899> it'll<00:01:18.049> make<00:01:18.319> it<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.679> little<00:01:19.039> bit<00:01:19.189> more

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
think it'll make it a little bit more

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.730 
think it'll make it a little bit more
skillful<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.240> use<00:01:20.479> instead<00:01:21.139> of<00:01:21.259> just<00:01:21.439> spraying

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
skillful to use instead of just spraying

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.200 
skillful to use instead of just spraying
and<00:01:21.889> praying<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.429> being<00:01:22.700> able<00:01:22.819> to<00:01:22.999> kill

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
and praying and being able to kill

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.899 
and praying and being able to kill
really<00:01:23.749> close<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.289> from<00:01:25.100> really<00:01:25.369> far<00:01:25.399> with

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
really close and from really far with

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.389 
really close and from really far with
the<00:01:26.149> reticle<00:01:26.630> basically<00:01:27.049> not<00:01:27.259> moving<00:01:27.649> all<00:01:27.799> so

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
the reticle basically not moving all so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.069 
the reticle basically not moving all so
now<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.819> battle<00:01:29.119> has<00:01:29.329> been<00:01:29.539> nerfed<00:01:29.780> or

now that the battle has been nerfed or

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
think is going to be the next gun that's

just<00:01:41.420> gonna<00:01:41.539> move<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.929> to<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.319> best<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.799> next

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
just gonna move on to the best the next

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.249 
just gonna move on to the best the next
best<00:01:43.310> weapon<00:01:43.759> which<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.389> this<00:01:44.509> case<00:01:44.569> i<00:01:44.959> think

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
best weapon which in this case i think

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.169 
best weapon which in this case i think
is<00:01:45.350> going<00:01:45.529> to<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.619> either<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.069> ak-12<00:01:46.789> or<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
is going to be either the ak-12 or the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.050 
is going to be either the ak-12 or the
IMR<00:01:47.659> now<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.259> rarely<00:01:48.740> ever<00:01:48.979> see<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.549> IM<00:01:49.729> are

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
IMR now I rarely ever see the IM are

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.480 
IMR now I rarely ever see the IM are
used<00:01:50.420> in<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:51.049> game<00:01:51.319> so<00:01:51.590> far<00:01:51.829> especially<00:01:52.159> in

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
used in this game so far especially in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.629 
used in this game so far especially in
public<00:01:52.609> Bobby's<00:01:53.380> it's<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:54.770> pretty<00:01:55.399> good

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:55.639 
public Bobby's it's it's pretty good

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.609 
public Bobby's it's it's pretty good
it's<00:01:55.939> basically<00:01:56.299> comparable<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.170> m8a1

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
it's basically comparable to the m8a1

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.069 
it's basically comparable to the m8a1
from<00:01:58.159> black<00:01:58.369> ops<00:01:58.609> 2<00:01:58.880> but<00:01:59.599> with<00:01:59.749> the<00:01:59.869> hit

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
from black ops 2 but with the hit

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.870 
from black ops 2 but with the hit
detection<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.799> bullet<00:02:01.279> registration<00:02:01.819> in

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
detection and bullet registration in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.429 
detection and bullet registration in
this<00:02:01.969> game<00:02:02.179> kind<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.599> makes<00:02:02.749> it<00:02:02.899> hard<00:02:03.139> to<00:02:03.319> get

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
this game kind of makes it hard to get

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.839 
this game kind of makes it hard to get
kills<00:02:03.770> especially<00:02:04.549> when<00:02:04.670> you're<00:02:04.789> getting

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
kills especially when you're getting

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.029 
kills especially when you're getting
melted<00:02:05.329> by<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.539> bow<00:02:05.779> with<00:02:06.079> it<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:06.619> I've<00:02:06.740> tried

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
melted by the bow with it now I've tried

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.430 
melted by the bow with it now I've tried
it<00:02:07.159> before<00:02:07.219> and<00:02:07.459> I'm<00:02:07.700> used<00:02:07.999> it<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
it before and I'm used it and I like the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.350 
it before and I'm used it and I like the
feel<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.490> just<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:10.700> nearly<00:02:11.210> as

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
feel of it but it's just not nearly as

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.410 
feel of it but it's just not nearly as
good<00:02:11.630> as<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.960> bow<00:02:12.230> at<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.590> point

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
good as the bow at this point

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.089 
good as the bow at this point
so<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.569> think<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.020> bow<00:02:14.170> need<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> very<00:02:14.800> slight

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so I think the bow need a very slight

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.550 
so I think the bow need a very slight
nerf<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.610> other<00:02:15.730> guns<00:02:15.970> need<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> buff<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.810> that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
nerf and other guns need a buff and that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.620 
nerf and other guns need a buff and that
includes<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.069> SMGs<00:02:18.550> because<00:02:18.970> right<00:02:19.209> now<00:02:19.239> no

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
includes the SMGs because right now no

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.290 
includes the SMGs because right now no
one<00:02:19.780> really<00:02:20.050> uses<00:02:20.260> smgs<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.700> still<00:02:22.030> think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
one really uses smgs and I still think

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.630 
one really uses smgs and I still think
they<00:02:22.480> need<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> big<00:02:23.380> buff<00:02:23.680> compared<00:02:24.550> to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
they need a big buff compared to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.220 
they need a big buff compared to
anything<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.569> as<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.930> see<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
anything now as you can see in the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.170 
anything now as you can see in the
gameplay<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> went<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> nice<00:02:27.280> 14<00:02:27.730> kill<00:02:27.940> streak

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
gameplay I went on a nice 14 kill streak

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.699 
gameplay I went on a nice 14 kill streak
now<00:02:28.300> i'm<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.569> die<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.780> couple<00:02:29.140> times<00:02:29.380> and

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
now i'm going to die a couple times and

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.979 
now i'm going to die a couple times and
then<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.130> go<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.459> another<00:02:30.550> 10<00:02:31.000> kill<00:02:31.270> streak<00:02:31.540> but

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
then we go on another 10 kill streak but

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.390 
then we go on another 10 kill streak but
i<00:02:32.080> went<00:02:32.260> back<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:32.950> i<00:02:32.980> was<00:02:33.040> talking<00:02:33.280> about

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
i went back to what i was talking about

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.729 
i went back to what i was talking about
with<00:02:34.060> they<00:02:34.480> did<00:02:34.720> buff<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.080> couple<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.530> guns

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
with they did buff a couple of the guns

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.280 
with they did buff a couple of the guns
and<00:02:35.980> i<00:02:36.130> don't<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.880> if<00:02:37.150> they<00:02:37.330> really<00:02:37.360> meant<00:02:38.110> to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and i don't know if they really meant to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.290 
and i don't know if they really meant to
because<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.739> kinda<00:02:39.130> strange<00:02:39.430> seems<00:02:39.760> weird<00:02:40.180> cuz

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
because it kinda strange seems weird cuz

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.580 
because it kinda strange seems weird cuz
they<00:02:40.420> never<00:02:40.569> really<00:02:40.720> mentioned<00:02:41.050> any<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.500> this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
they never really mentioned any of this

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
they never really mentioned any of this
stuff<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:42.069> us<00:02:42.100> but<00:02:42.880> they<00:02:42.970> buffed<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.540> em1<00:02:43.930> and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
stuff to us but they buffed the em1 and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250 
stuff to us but they buffed the em1 and
that<00:02:45.250> dual-x<00:02:45.850> mgs<00:02:46.360> which<00:02:46.569> were<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> akimbo

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
that dual-x mgs which were the akimbo

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.550 
that dual-x mgs which were the akimbo
light<00:02:48.069> machine<00:02:48.430> guns<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.319> for<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.410> record

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
light machine guns and for the record

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.000 
light machine guns and for the record
neither<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.250> those<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:52.569> i<00:02:53.140> mean<00:02:53.500> i<00:02:53.709> guess

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
neither of those really i mean i guess

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.009 
neither of those really i mean i guess
they<00:02:54.160> didn't<00:02:54.459> need<00:02:54.519> buffed<00:02:54.880> I've<00:02:55.090> used<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.600> XM

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
they didn't need buffed I've used the XM

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.840 
they didn't need buffed I've used the XM
geez<00:02:56.230> before<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:56.920> honestly<00:02:57.160> couldn't<00:02:57.610> even

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
geez before and I honestly couldn't even

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.979 
geez before and I honestly couldn't even
go<00:02:57.970> positive<00:02:58.299> when<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.140> tried<00:02:59.530> them<00:02:59.709> but

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
go positive when I tried them but

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.539 
go positive when I tried them but
whoever<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.350> their<00:03:02.500> right<00:03:02.680> mind<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.040> gonna<00:03:03.160> use

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
whoever in their right mind is gonna use

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.890 
whoever in their right mind is gonna use
those<00:03:03.730> unless<00:03:03.970> they're<00:03:04.269> trying<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.870> know

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
those unless they're trying to you know

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.370 
those unless they're trying to you know
be<00:03:05.709> wacky<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.459> fun<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:08.170> reason

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
be wacky and have fun so the reason

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.070 
be wacky and have fun so the reason
above<00:03:08.890> those<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.519> not<00:03:09.790> really<00:03:10.030> sure<00:03:10.150> what

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
above those I'm not really sure what

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.380 
above those I'm not really sure what
they<00:03:11.290> were<00:03:11.350> doing<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.980> mean<00:03:12.459> yes<00:03:12.850> they<00:03:13.060> needed

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
they were doing I mean yes they needed

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.100 
they were doing I mean yes they needed
buffed<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:14.530> why<00:03:14.920> not<00:03:15.069> focus<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:16.209> SMGs<00:03:16.840> and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
buffed but why not focus on the SMGs and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.289 
buffed but why not focus on the SMGs and
the<00:03:17.170> stuff<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.410> actually<00:03:17.620> matters<00:03:18.299> before

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the stuff that actually matters before

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.750

you<00:03:19.660> mess<00:03:20.109> around<00:03:20.140> with<00:03:20.590> your<00:03:20.739> energy<00:03:21.400> weapons

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
you mess around with your energy weapons

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.069 
you mess around with your energy weapons
and<00:03:22.000> your<00:03:22.870> akimbo<00:03:23.620> LMGs<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:25.510> not<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:25.959> sure

what<00:03:26.739> they<00:03:26.859> were<00:03:26.920> thinking<00:03:27.100> honestly<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.570> I'm

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
what they were thinking honestly so I'm

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.979 
what they were thinking honestly so I'm
a<00:03:29.410> little<00:03:29.709> confused<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:30.910> they<00:03:31.420> still<00:03:31.720> haven't

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
a little confused but they still haven't

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.289 
a little confused but they still haven't
bought<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.350> SMGs<00:03:32.950> or<00:03:33.160> anything<00:03:33.519> else<00:03:33.700> that

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
bought the SMGs or anything else that

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.390 
bought the SMGs or anything else that
really<00:03:34.480> needs<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.260> yet<00:03:35.920> they've<00:03:36.100> nursed

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400

the bal and buff the em1 and dual xmg so

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.569 
the bal and buff the em1 and dual xmg so
who<00:03:40.239> knows<00:03:40.390> what<00:03:40.660> they're<00:03:40.810> really<00:03:40.930> thinking

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
who knows what they're really thinking

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.069 
who knows what they're really thinking
but<00:03:42.579> anyway<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:42.910> believe<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.570> reign<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.840> the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
but anyway I believe the reign of the

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.500 
but anyway I believe the reign of the
bowel<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.829> game<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.190> over<00:03:45.640> will<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.269> still

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
bowel in this game is over will it still

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.090 
bowel in this game is over will it still
be<00:03:46.540> used<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:47.019> competitive<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.709> public

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
be used in competitive and public

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.310 
be used in competitive and public
lobbies<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.700> course<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.600> will<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:49.959> be<00:03:50.019> more

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
lobbies of course it will just be more

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.370 
lobbies of course it will just be more
skillful<00:03:50.829> use<00:03:51.100> how<00:03:51.430> did<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:51.970> guy<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.480> not

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
skillful use how did that guy just not

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.890 
skillful use how did that guy just not
die<00:03:53.680> there<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.190> think<00:03:55.150> it'll<00:03:55.299> still<00:03:55.540> be<00:03:55.660> used

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
die there I think it'll still be used

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.890 
die there I think it'll still be used
quite<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.500> bit<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:57.819> might<00:03:57.970> see<00:03:58.239> no<00:03:58.450> one<00:03:58.660> or<00:03:58.750> two

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
quite a bit you might see no one or two

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.009 
quite a bit you might see no one or two
people<00:03:59.109> using<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.739> on<00:03:59.859> each<00:04:00.040> team<00:04:00.370> but<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.480> now

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
people using it on each team but in now

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.150 
people using it on each team but in now
it's<00:04:02.260> going<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.500> probably<00:04:02.709> be<00:04:02.859> more

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
it's going to probably be more

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.130 
it's going to probably be more
diversified<00:04:03.880> at<00:04:04.120> least<00:04:04.359> in<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.630> sense<00:04:04.900> that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
diversified at least in this sense that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.180 
diversified at least in this sense that
people<00:04:05.290> are<00:04:05.470> going<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.650> use<00:04:05.769> different

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
people are going to use different

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.059 
people are going to use different
assault<00:04:06.519> rifles<00:04:06.910> I'm<00:04:07.530> sure<00:04:08.530> I'm<00:04:08.620> sure<00:04:08.680> you're

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
assault rifles I'm sure I'm sure you're

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.059 
assault rifles I'm sure I'm sure you're
still<00:04:09.340> not<00:04:09.430> gonna<00:04:09.579> see<00:04:09.819> very<00:04:10.030> many<00:04:10.180> SMGs

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
still not gonna see very many SMGs

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.080 
still not gonna see very many SMGs
because<00:04:12.069> they're<00:04:12.250> still<00:04:12.430> not<00:04:12.579> very<00:04:12.639> viable

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
because they're still not very viable

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.330 
because they're still not very viable
and<00:04:13.420> they<00:04:13.510> still<00:04:13.750> need<00:04:13.900> buff<00:04:14.109> but<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.250> think

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
and they still need buff but I think

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.560 
and they still need buff but I think
you'll<00:04:15.850> see<00:04:15.910> more<00:04:16.269> ak-12<00:04:17.070> HPR<00:04:18.070> threes<00:04:18.570> what

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
you'll see more ak-12 HPR threes what

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.339 
you'll see more ak-12 HPR threes what
are<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.780> other<00:04:19.900> ones

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
are the other ones

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.740 
are the other ones
ARX<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:23.430> mr<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.819> think<00:04:24.270> that's<00:04:24.449> all<00:04:24.569> of<00:04:24.599> them

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
ARX and I mr I think that's all of them

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.640 
ARX and I mr I think that's all of them
I<00:04:25.020> can't<00:04:25.349> remember<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.990> that's<00:04:28.319> that's

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
I can't remember and so that's that's

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.999 
I can't remember and so that's that's
actually<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.069> good<00:04:29.280> thing<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:30.750> now<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.949> the

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
actually a good thing but now that the

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.520 
actually a good thing but now that the
battle<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.340> nerved<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.849> don't<00:04:33.330> think<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:34.380> it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
battle is nerved I don't think that it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.200 
battle is nerved I don't think that it
will<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.830> most<00:04:34.860> competitive<00:04:35.490> gun<00:04:35.849> anymore

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
will be the most competitive gun anymore

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.089 
will be the most competitive gun anymore
and<00:04:36.539> I<00:04:36.599> think<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.930> will<00:04:36.990> move<00:04:37.199> on<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.620> IMR

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
and I think that will move on to the IMR

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.339 
and I think that will move on to the IMR
and<00:04:38.340> if<00:04:38.669> they<00:04:38.789> buff<00:04:38.970> smgs<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.840> might<00:04:40.020> make<00:04:40.169> one

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
and if they buff smgs it might make one

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.249 
and if they buff smgs it might make one
of<00:04:40.470> them<00:04:40.560> viable<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:41.610> for<00:04:41.819> now<00:04:41.940> we<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:43.020> say

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
of them viable but for now we can say

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.580 
of them viable but for now we can say
that<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.740> bow<00:04:43.979> has<00:04:44.280> had<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.520> good<00:04:44.970> run<00:04:45.240> and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
that the bow has had a good run and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.469 
that the bow has had a good run and
sadly<00:04:46.590> now<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:47.039> is<00:04:47.160> not<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.610> best<00:04:47.759> gun<00:04:48.090> anymore

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
sadly now it is not the best gun anymore

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.839 
sadly now it is not the best gun anymore
at<00:04:48.870> least<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:49.319> my<00:04:49.470> opinion<00:04:49.669> so<00:04:50.669> that's

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
at least in my opinion so that's

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:51.920 
at least in my opinion so that's
basically<00:04:51.000> everything<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.539> want<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.750> talk

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
basically everything I want to talk

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.870 
basically everything I want to talk
about<00:04:51.960> with<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.440> ballast<00:04:53.099> I<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.699> couple
