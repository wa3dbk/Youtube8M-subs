00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.269
 what's up i find friends 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.030
 right now for training but 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.949
 before I find another thing to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 interested in one or the other 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.380
 because I could already do that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.480
 and it is about 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.609
 the phenomenon 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 what is feldmann is thin has 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.769
 maybe win legs 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.899
 but you also have it on your stomach 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.760
 but there are different ones among them 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.040
 The fat plants can also on the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.450
 Tomorrow are at the hips but at the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.649
 legs or po it's just that 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 the muscles are small but you still 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.410
 Fed owns then you can of course 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.079
 difficult to assign a body is one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 Now mehsud one is now ektomorf 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.879
 you have to end now you have of course 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.890
 the aspects of an ektomorf 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.439
 by having thin arms to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.060
 but also the points of view 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.970
 i was i want i can find this now 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 not word but you also have the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 signs so i can say that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.280
 also the signs of a change 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.490
 because you fall, for example, on the stomach 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.439
 Many of my coaching clients have too 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 this problem how can it ever 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.070
 This is usually the case 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.240
 Now of the type of body type hectare one is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.710
 has narrow bones narrow hips thin 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.680
 Wrists and by nature genetically 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.000
 not too much musculature 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.420
 But why do you have this field now? 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.390
 for example because you shit on the belly 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 in March, I say that because we never 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.920
 ektomorf be trained 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.540
 you have no muscle mass but you 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 at more nourished you damn bad 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.729
 by pizza dÃ¶ner always outside it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.920
 There is very little rain outside 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.629
 the good the good food have good 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.590
 fitness food is usually that 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:17.569
 driver field what do i know the ross crocs 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.610
 and so on and then unfortunately expensive 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.830
 body fat 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.930
 of course he has to stock up in fat 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 because you eat all the fucking 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.670
 sees where with her about your basic needs 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.530
 comes and fat deposits 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.230
 why are the poor now and they are 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.330
 both are not wider for example because 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.670
 your body's genetic is built that way 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.680
 that he, for example, on the belly fat 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.470
 stored and not to the ament to the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.450
 legs alaska on the legs but come 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.610
 not at the belly or it can only 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.260
 when that's arrived, that's genetic 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.010
 destined you can not 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.049
 choose where you are fat and where 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.239
 not and usually is in the field 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.519
 so that you have no arms but the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.400
 belly you can not do anything about it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.980
 if you eat more calories than 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.700
 We will burn those calories in the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.239
 stored belly fat and not in the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.850
 poor 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.239
 yes, if you are lucky then you are 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.459
 just built that you can not 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.859
 change you can not choose where 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.250
 one fat stores one that makes it 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.450
 body for you how can you do that now 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.630
 how can you improve that now ? 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.340
 you can achieve a good body 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.500
 In particular, one puts one puts 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.120
 first and foremost, his diet around man 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 maybe with the calories count 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.450
 and does not look that no longer there 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.700
 just with shit in the calories 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.510
 Surplus comes to you somehow 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.849
 deficit or in the neutral 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.400
 calorie balance but that one good 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.079
 eating and working with it 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.459
 either whether one is building muscles 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.980
 then go into surplus or else 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.720
 first wants to get rid of the construction field and in 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.000
 the deficit will go even if you feel like it 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.260
 a mega run is when you first that 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.450
 abdominal fat decreases 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.100
 but that's the way it is when you can 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.630
 you right 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.940
 defined was completely motivated in 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.220
 the construction phase states no matter how many 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.290
 kilos on the scales is yes you have to 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.540
 first get rid of the belly fat or 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.400
 that was in my last video she 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.960
 now also touched on this topic 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.850
 or her murder first with muscle mass 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.800
 his plans that you got fat on the stomach 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.270
 but sounds thick arms 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 yes of course you have to ask why 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.040
 in the calorie surplus but with 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.710
 good to take your body enough 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.230
 micronutrients has gotten and clean 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.230
 macro nutrients war over muscles 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.060
 yes yes then will be synonymous 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.220
 also the most taken 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.840
 energetic muscles are not plugged 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.850
 into the fed construction you may become 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.160
 I can not get rid of my stomach yet 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.780
 but you will build muscles and you 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.960
 you will not have a citizen but 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.160
 generally falls on the whole body and 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.600
 of course also basic muscle mass and 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.910
 thank you define 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.720
 I would have my last video 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.810
 to look 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.060
 first mass phase or only by definition 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:19.600
 phase so how can you but 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.700
 in summary, avoid 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.100
 you have to change all diet and 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.080
 you definitely have to have it 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.080
 forgot to say that's why dax now in 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.050
 the summary is definitely 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.280
 start to train and hard 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.780
 progressive loud google times that 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.540
 keyword if you do not know what that 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.020
 racism always means training 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.000
 but be and you have to be yours 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.730
 regeneration pay attention to it at all 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.340
 can build muscle with these three 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:53.500
 will score animal nutrition training and 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.390
 regeneration you will build muscle and 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.280
 then degrease afterwards or only fat 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.190
 break down and after muscle building and her 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.190
 Become a better body with it 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.190
 to reach
