00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.130
 apostle chapter 1 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.590
 Simon Peter Servant and Apostle of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.450
 Jesus Christ to those who have reached 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.359
 for the justice of our god and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.340
 savior Jesus Christ a faith equally 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.920
 precious that ours 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.169
 grace and steps are multiplied in the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 knowledge of God and our Lord 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.970
 Jesus like all the things that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 belong to life and to godliness we 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.439
 they have been given by their divine power 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 through the knowledge of the one who 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.340
 He called us for his glory and excellence 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 half of which has given us 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 precious and very great promises for 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.750
 that by them comes to six do 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 participants of the divine nature 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.640
 having run away from the corruption that there is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.320
 in the world because of concupiscence 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 you also putting all 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
 diligence for this same added to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 your faith virtue to virtue 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.519
 knowledge to domain knowledge 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.219
 own to own domain patience to the 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.780
 patience pity to pity affection 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.090
 brotherly and brotherly affection love 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.420
 because if these things are in you 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.430
 and they abound, they will not let you be idle or 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.220
 without fruit in terms of knowledge of 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.440
 our lord jesus christ but the one who does not 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.320
 have these things have the view very 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.290
 short is blind having forgotten the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 purification of their ancient sins by 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.940
 which brothers all the more sought after 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.030
 be firm your vocation and choice 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.970
 because doing these things we will not fall 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.399
 never because in this way or it will be 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.259
 granted broad and generous entry into the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.649
 eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.050
 Jesus Christ for this I will not stop 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.300
 Always remember these things even though 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.970
 you of the country and you are 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.039
 confirmed in the present truth then 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.000
 I'm fair because I'm in 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.789
 this body 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.530
 awakening you with admonition 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.990
 knowing that soon I must abandon the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.780
 body like our Lord Jesus Christ I 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.789
 He has also declared I will try with 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.429
 diligence that after my departure 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.190
 you can at all times have 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.989
 memory of these things because I do not 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.440
 we have made known the power and 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.660
 coming 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.510
 Our Lord Jesus Christ Following 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.460
 artificial fables but as having 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.950
 seen with our own eyes his 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.800
 majesty then when he received from God 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 Father honors and glory was sent 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.660
 from the magnificent glory a voice that 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.330
 he said this is my beloved son in which 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.460
 I am complacent and we hear 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.550
 states sent from heaven when 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.380
 we were with him on the holy mountain 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.690
 we also have the prophetic word more 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.910
 sure you do well to be 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.650
 attentive as to a torch that illuminates 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.840
 in a dark place until the day 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.510
 dawns and the morning star 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.000
 come out in your hearts understanding 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.190
 first this that no prophecy of the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.770
 writing is of private interpretation 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.930
 because the prophecy was never brought by 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.360
 human will but the saints 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.980
 men of god spoke being 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.980
 inspired by the holy spirit 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.100
 chapter 2 but there were also false 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.230
 prophets among the people as there will be 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.390
 among you false teachers who 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.000
 they will secretly introduce heresies 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.700
 destructive and will still deny the Lord that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.700
 rescued them by attracting themselves 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.920
 sudden destruction and many will follow 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.560
 their solutions because of which 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.600
 the way of truth will be blasphemed and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.570
 by avarice they will make merchandise of 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.730
 you with faked words about 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.570
 such already long- time condemnation 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.550
 he does not delay and his doom does not sleep 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.740
 because if God did not forgive the angels 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.050
 who sinned but throwing them 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.480
 hell he handed them over to prisons of 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.240
 darkness to be reserved for judgment 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.430
 and if he did not forgive the ancient world but 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.070
 who kept noah as a preacher of justice 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.770
 with seven other people bringing the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.420
 deluge over the world of the wicked and 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.330
 if he condemned by destruction to 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.100
 Sodom and gomorrah cities 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.570
 reducing them to ash and putting them 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.630
 example to those who were to live 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.519
 cleanly and delivered the just overwhelmed 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.510
 for the nefarious conduct of the wicked 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.700
 chapter 3 beloved this is the second 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.010
 letter that I write to you and in both 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.380
 I awake with exhortation your clean 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.880
 understanding so that you have memory 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.550
 of the words that have been 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.770
 said by the holy prophets and the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.230
 commandment of the Lord and savior given 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.600
 for your apostles knowing first 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.790
 this that in the last days will come 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.340
 mockers walking according to their own 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.860
 concupiscence and saying where is the 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.900
 promise of his advent because from 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.910
 the day that the fathers fell asleep all 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.850
 things remain that way from the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.160
 principle of creation this is ignored 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.410
 voluntarily than in ancient time 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.870
 they were made by the word of God 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.450
 heavens and also the earth that comes 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.250
 of water and water remains so 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.979
 which the world of then perished 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.990
 drowned in water but the heavens and the 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.600
 land that exist now are 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.890
 reserved for the same word 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.050
 kept for the fire on the day of 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.460
 judgment and the perdition of men 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.560
 most beloved impÃ­os you do not ignore this that 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.090
 to the Lord one day is like a thousand 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.520
 years and a thousand years as a day 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.980
 the lord does not delay his promise according to 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.320
 some have it for lateness but 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.540
 He is patient to us not 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.780
 wanting no one to perish but 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.790
 all proceed to repentance but 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.280
 the day of the Lord will come as a thief in 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.470
 the night in which the heavens will pass 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.110
 with great destroying and the elements 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.470
 burning will be undone and the earth and 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.180
 the works that are there will be burned 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.790
 since all these things have to be 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.910
 discarded as you should not walk 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.200
 in holy and pious way of life 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.540
 waiting and hurrying you for the 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.780
 coming of the day of God in which the 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.760
 skies igniting will be undone and 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.240
 the elements being burned is 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.639
 they will melt but we wait according to 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.120
 his promises new heavens and earth 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.520
 new in which justice dwells by 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.100
 which oh beloved ones waiting for 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.110
 these things try diligently to be 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.530
 found by him without spot and 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.449
 irreproachable in peace and have understood 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.700
 that the patience of our Lord is 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.660
 for salvation as well as our 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.760
 beloved brother pablo 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.950
 according to the wisdom that has been given 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.200
 He has written to you almost in all his 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.450
 epistles speaking in them of these 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.760
 things among which there are some 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.370
 difficult to understand which 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.440
 unlearned and unstable twists as 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.440
 also the other scriptures for your 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.410
 own perdition so you or 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.690
 beloved, knowing it in advance, beware 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.060
 lest they be dragged by the error of 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.970
 the wicked fall from your firmness 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.770
 rather to grow in grace and the 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.940
 knowledge of our lord and savior 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.070
 Jesus Christ to him be glory now and up 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.310
 the day of eternity 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.310
 Amen
