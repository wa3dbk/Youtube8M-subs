 which was knowing the features were different 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:49.730
 a well and Josh with their employees 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:56.910
 simpsons works and so let's get started 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:59.760
 I tell most other places most 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 strong there are such grants that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:11.790
 here would be the graveyard's correspondence 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:15.720
 where they were originally why 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 it is generally for the people there can not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 watch this series I will tell you about here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.619
 now i'm just not the last 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 only does not mean the first such answering 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.570
 where they meet at us begin 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.650
 action then action takes place 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.020
 somewhat lower 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:49.820
 and partly in the restaurant 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:53.780
 me in a dream the main agonist but more he 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.159
 such a positive self hero body itself 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.329
 and inconsistencies so yar uk which 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.590
 there are a lot of actions that we have 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:12.410
 It turns out a huge number of references and 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 Respectively still a garage that sleep in 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.530
 which is big enough 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 the action is big so well 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.060
 accordingly, we also have in chrome 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.349
 the garage still turns on 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.810
 valentine's house to fall then parents but here 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.989
 these are all other programs that were 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.720
 given Fedya 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.209
 so you know, like gradually 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.239
 how to tell on the main map 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.010
 and so I will only say that without 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.930
 ships 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.090
 you need to be sung accordingly now 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:54.790
 look at big maybe famous 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.780
 clue programs like when parcels 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.750
 for let's start with the cipher at the end 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.409
 then here you can see here is such a 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.790
 kanzashi program 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:32.260
 at the end of friends and accordingly she 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:36.420
 stands for something like this 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.420
 now let's look at the sendings 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:47.459
 how do we meet again with our 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:55.480
 agents with a sail coach 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:57.730
 as usual here as it was it is a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.730
 presentation on this music is another video 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:10.500
 Here is this American patriot who 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:10.500
 was also we saw 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:26.889
 suffered and still we meet 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:29.919
 robin's suit has collected everything in his room 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.260
 The sendings that were given to the network are also 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.700
 can 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.190
 look at the name that roamed 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:46.140
 possible new so she was called 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:49.230

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.070

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.710
 accordingly violating avanti 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.690
 but I will tell you about the costume in Russian 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.280
 because the load on it is still not 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.380
 understand the main there is a reference 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.150
 hints to paint trigger 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:17.000

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.880
 there was no such thing 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.020
 worth noting the plot lines are the most 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:44.780
 interesting moments 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:44.780
