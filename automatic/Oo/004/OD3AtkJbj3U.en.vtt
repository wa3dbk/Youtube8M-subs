00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 also today the protocol came into force 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.280
 that the police must follow to avoid 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.889
 violence with crowds 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.469
 demonstrations rallies you do not have the 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.210
 new regulations are based on the law that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.470
 regulates the use of force in the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 ports public safety district 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.140
 see but according to a review that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.080
 we did in article 25 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 this law would contradict with 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.529
 the protocol published yesterday and in force to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.529
 from today 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.090
 according to the current protocol of action 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.580
 police of the security secretariat 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.170
 public of the federal district is no longer 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.170
 You will see this in the Mexican capital 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.710
 but what will happen now the cops 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.539
 they must encapsulate the protesters 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.700
 that are identified with the attitude 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.740
 aggressive should be separated from the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.689
 contingent and arrest them to avoid 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.219
 that criminal acts are committed and 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.220
 put at risk the safety of 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:33.009
 protesters what we are going to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.460
 continue in this construction in these 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.920
 protocols that are being implemented is 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.700
 obviously the rational use with the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.250
 UN parameters 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.829
 according to this protocol the four scales 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.750
 of the use of force are persuasion 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.700
 through conciliatory dialogue 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 once this step fails, 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.229
 will proceed to the physical reduction of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 movements if you proceed to the use of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.240
 force will be made by weapons 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.729
 non-lethal incapacitants 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.369
 finally the protocol authorizes the use 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.479
 of firearms or lethal force in 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.479
 extreme cases of violence 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.940
 this last point must be applied accordingly 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.860
 with the concepts of concordance of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.070
 principles of human rights and 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.110
 Exceptionality criteria need 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.940
 proportionality and humanity in this 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.700
 point the protocol published yesterday in the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.710
 official gazette of the capital government 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.300
 contradicts article 25 of the regulates 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.040
 the use of force from the bodies of 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.050
 public safety of the federal district 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.670
 since this regulation prohibits 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 expressly the use of firearms 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.380
 by lethal force in the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.540
 manifestations 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.520
 although at once the head of government 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.850
 says that the use of force will not be 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.010
 necessary but I have given the instruction of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.260
 that in our normative body also 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.210
 are the considerations of the supreme 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.680
 court of justice of the mutual nation there 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.650
 a resolution of the supreme court that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.319
 making the hierarchy of the use of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.950
 strength practically in one of his 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.500
 determinations in one of his sentences 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.080
 it was where he established 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.630
 about this matter in October 2010 the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.040
 supreme court of justice of the nation 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.470
 adopted an opinion stating that 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 for the use of public force 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.920
 especially the lethal one must be done 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.090
 only the one authorized by law for 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.040
 do what 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.290
