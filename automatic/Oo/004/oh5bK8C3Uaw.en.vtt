to<00:02:01.429> show<00:02:01.639> you<00:02:01.669> guys<00:02:02.029> what<00:02:02.569> that<00:02:02.599> looks<00:02:03.079> like

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.570 

so<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.840> soft<00:02:10.259> rolling<00:02:10.770> boil<00:02:11.039> looks

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
so this is what soft rolling boil looks

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.000 
so this is what soft rolling boil looks
like<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.180> once<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.990> your<00:02:13.260> heavy<00:02:13.680> whipping

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
like so once you see your heavy whipping

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.090 
like so once you see your heavy whipping
cream<00:02:14.180> turns<00:02:15.180> into<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:16.080> soft<00:02:16.470> rolling<00:02:16.740> boil

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
cream turns into this soft rolling boil

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.190 
cream turns into this soft rolling boil
