00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
this wants to boil over so bad when it

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.410 
this wants to boil over so bad when it
gets<00:00:41.380> down<00:00:41.560> on<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.740> real<00:00:41.920> sugary<00:00:42.340> if<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.270> could

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
gets down on a real sugary if I could

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.120 
gets down on a real sugary if I could
just<00:00:43.600> get<00:00:43.810> it<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.050> drop<00:00:44.170> down<00:00:44.560> so<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:44.860> can<00:00:44.980> get<00:00:45.100> a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
just get it to drop down so I can get a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.070 
just get it to drop down so I can get a
better<00:00:45.310> reading<00:00:45.610> we're<00:00:45.850> at<00:00:45.940> 218<00:00:46.570> eight<00:00:46.840> and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
better reading we're at 218 eight and

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.270 
better reading we're at 218 eight and
holding<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.600> got<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.900> keep<00:00:50.740> in<00:00:50.890> mind<00:00:51.070> that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
holding but you got to keep in mind that

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.920 
holding but you got to keep in mind that
you're<00:00:51.460> kind<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.850> measuring<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.750> temperature

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
you're kind of measuring the temperature

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:25.130 
you're kind of measuring the temperature
among<00:00:53.500> all<00:00:53.680> these<00:00:53.860> bubbles

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.930 

I<00:01:25.170> think<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:25.980> I'm<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.190> do<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.790> can

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
I think what I'm gonna do is if I can

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.640 
I think what I'm gonna do is if I can
hit<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.470> 20.6

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
hit two 20.6

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.400 
hit two 20.6
I'm<00:01:29.280> gonna<00:01:29.520> call<00:01:29.760> it<00:01:29.940> good<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.480> $2.99<00:01:31.380> Oh

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
I'm gonna call it good because $2.99 Oh

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.780 
I'm gonna call it good because $2.99 Oh
is<00:01:31.740> fine<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.760> did<00:01:32.910> it<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.150> 224<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.220> ended<00:01:35.640> up

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
is fine we did it at 224 and it ended up

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.970 
is fine we did it at 224 and it ended up
after<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.150> few<00:01:36.360> days<00:01:36.600> getting<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.440> of<00:01:37.530> sugary

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
after a few days getting kind of sugary

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.760 
after a few days getting kind of sugary
and<00:01:38.100> crystallized<00:01:38.910> insight<00:01:39.480> partially<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and crystallized insight partially so I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
and crystallized insight partially so I
want<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.190> safe<00:01:41.460> here

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
want to be safe here

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.230 
want to be safe here
so<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:43.110> thinking<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.790> 20.6<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> we're<00:01:45.090> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so I'm thinking to 20.6 and we're going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.170 
so I'm thinking to 20.6 and we're going
to<00:01:45.300> call<00:01:45.480> her<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> day

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.130 

there<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.260> go<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.740> 20.6<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:57.660> gonna<00:01:57.780> pull<00:01:58.020> this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
there we go to 20.6 I'm gonna pull this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630 
there we go to 20.6 I'm gonna pull this
off<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.530> heat<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> we'll<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.220> how<00:01:59.310> much<00:01:59.430> we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
off the heat and we'll see how much we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.470 
off the heat and we'll see how much we
ended<00:01:59.850> up<00:01:59.910> with<00:02:01.430> okay<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.240> off

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
ended up with okay so we got that off

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.300 
ended up with okay so we got that off
which<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.870> good<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.800> let<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.040> cool<00:02:05.250> down

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
which is good just let this cool down

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.470 
which is good just let this cool down
for<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.640> couple<00:02:05.790> minutes<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> I'm<00:02:06.300> going<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
for a couple minutes and I'm going to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.109 
for a couple minutes and I'm going to
jar<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.590> such<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.100> nail-biter<00:02:08.880> when

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
jar this up it's such a nail-biter when

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.340 
jar this up it's such a nail-biter when
you<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> end<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.259> you've

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
you get to the end like that and you've

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.150 
you get to the end like that and you've
been<00:02:10.500> boiling<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.150> hours<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.480> hours<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.320> you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
been boiling for hours and hours and you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.210 
been boiling for hours and hours and you
know<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.700> degrees<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.270> ruin<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
know what just two degrees can ruin it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.100 
know what just two degrees can ruin it
not<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.250> bad<00:02:17.520> couple<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.090> days<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.480> boiling<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
not a bad couple of days of boiling I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.630 
not a bad couple of days of boiling I
got<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:19.800> than<00:02:19.980> what<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.100> thought

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
got more than what I thought

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.540 
got more than what I thought
I<00:02:20.670> ended<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.500> five<00:02:22.500> full<00:02:22.890> ones<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.430> one

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
I ended up with five full ones and one

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.590 
I ended up with five full ones and one
that's<00:02:23.640> between<00:02:24.030> half<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.420> three<00:02:24.570> quarters

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that's between half and three quarters

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's between half and three quarters
the<00:02:24.930> way<00:02:25.110> hole

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the way hole

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.820 
the way hole
I<00:02:26.360> still<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.510> boxelder<00:02:27.989> sap<00:02:28.380> that's<00:02:28.620> out

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
I still have boxelder sap that's out

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.170 
I still have boxelder sap that's out
there<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.160> needs<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.489> boiled<00:02:29.880> but<00:02:29.970> now<00:02:30.150> I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
there that needs to be boiled but now I

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.270 
there that needs to be boiled but now I
am<00:02:30.570> switched<00:02:30.870> over<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.350> my<00:02:31.500> bucket<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
am switched over because my bucket of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.850 
am switched over because my bucket of
