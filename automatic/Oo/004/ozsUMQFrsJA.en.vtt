00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 speak bacteria today let's talk about 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.140
 dynamics in turns 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.360
 the dynamic is nothing more than you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.270
 seat there are some notes to highlight 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.000
 them from the others in this example we will 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.790
 pick up china and let's go 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 to accentuate some of them to form 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.800
 the turns turned using the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 dynamics looks great because you 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.550
 puts a different model in the music and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.190
 it seems that the turn is broken but in the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 You're only one hundred years old for the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 seat comes out firm 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.490
 you can use reagent shores 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.830
 resort is the meeting of the air or with the skin 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.140
 or you play drumstick box you go 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.720
 playing both the UN as the skin and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.820
 same time to do this 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.450
 example of dynamics using them and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.489
 China 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.560
 the whole note with the right hand we go 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.810
 accent and all note with the hand 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.060
 left we will execute notes 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.090
 ghosts ghosts are our 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.290
 are played very quietly in the box going 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.290
 be fired too weak 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.450
 the base year to be generated will be 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.350
 that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.350
 see only how it is 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.429
 after you completely master 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.679
 this basic exercise 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.880
 just you apply on different pieces 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.859
 of the battery 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.939
 see now for example 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.939
 you practice 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.070
 O 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 O 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:59.970
 I hope you enjoyed it if 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.100
 you want to get the score access 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.620
 my site the link is down here in 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.990
 description of this video if you liked it 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.479
 I liked this video clip since that 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.030
 like extraordinary sign up for the channel 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.940
 to receive weekly updates of 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.570
 videos and sheet music a hug and even 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.570
 next week
