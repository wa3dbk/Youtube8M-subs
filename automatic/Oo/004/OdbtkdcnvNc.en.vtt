to<00:00:34.360> change<00:00:34.720> mood<00:00:35.200> and<00:00:35.440> character<00:00:35.980> for<00:00:36.250> each

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
to change mood and character for each

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.360 
to change mood and character for each
piece<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.650> we<00:00:38.650> don't<00:00:38.860> have<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.100> lot<00:00:39.340> of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
piece and we don't have a lot of

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.540 
piece and we don't have a lot of
downtime<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:40.570> course<00:00:40.809> dancers<00:00:41.320> I'm<00:00:42.040> part<00:00:42.430> of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
downtime of course dancers I'm part of

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.180 
downtime of course dancers I'm part of
the<00:00:42.850> ensemble<00:00:43.180> or<00:00:44.020> like<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.470> chorus<00:00:44.770> you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
the ensemble or like the chorus you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.210 
the ensemble or like the chorus you
might<00:00:45.370> say<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.230> still<00:00:47.620> think<00:00:47.860> it's<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.040> very

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
might say but I still think it's a very

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.460 
might say but I still think it's a very
big<00:00:48.489> part<00:00:48.850> because<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.840> sheer<00:00:50.080> number<00:00:50.110> of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
big part because the sheer number of

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.430 
big part because the sheer number of
choreographies<00:00:51.370> that<00:00:51.730> we<00:00:52.150> need<00:00:52.450> to<00:00:52.720> perform

choreographies that we need to perform

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.790 
choreographies that we need to perform
and<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:55.150> amount<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.629> time<00:00:55.900> that<00:00:55.930> we<00:00:56.320> are<00:00:56.530> on
