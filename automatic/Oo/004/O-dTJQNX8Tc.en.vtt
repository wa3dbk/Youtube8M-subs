00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
he kind of just stands still for a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.370 
he kind of just stands still for a
little<00:02:01.579> bit<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.030> that's<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.719> time<00:02:03.109> when<00:02:03.289> you

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380

just a ton faster a lot of people don't

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.850 
just a ton faster a lot of people don't
make<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.480> past<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.900> area<00:02:21.290> because<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
and then wait for the timing after all

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.490 
and then wait for the timing after all
of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.120> aliens<00:02:32.510> are<00:02:32.600> dead<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.960> once<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.260> kid
