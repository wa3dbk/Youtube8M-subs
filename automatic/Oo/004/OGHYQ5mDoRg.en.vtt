00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
 Round ends August and 18 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.480
 Bonn Halo has gathered under the roof 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.609
 Today I want to finally show a faded video% EBT fell there 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.760
 a lot of people would have to press Ctrl and then the video 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.909
 easy in the countries 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.740
 or the short scenes 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.520
 who then doubles speed or 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.170
 slow down 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.520
 but there that is nothing special 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.450
 Fergie strikes would be like me in a video clip 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.760
 I sat a club-boss paper fall it is very slow it goes very slowly 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.200
 under the time would be more 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.530
 normal normal speed continues to run 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 That's how I've already got the video over here 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.170
 because the parts are inserted and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.360
 ever 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.550
 cut so cut 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.970
 Altheim there was only the clock 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.040
 then there was seconds then your ticket he was not so good but the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.990
 Shadow is reasonably good to see 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.160
 Percent and I would also come here then 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.270
 Predator off course 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 when I am there 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.330
 the water has come that way 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.850
 have fast runs 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.290
 and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.320
 the Tyrolean 2 under 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.180
 this is what he's going to watch on the video in front of her since 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.390
 the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.920
 with the Wanderer clock 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.230
 exciting for children 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.900
 so 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 cut yourselves out 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.740
 so 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 so 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 it's just that affected stitch knows that it's me degree 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.120
 Percent it was indeed not so good 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.899
 because not land around her 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.439
 Sensuality is different because the heaps beat and turned against it 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.819
 Percent there you have to change at the same time 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.719
 but otherwise 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.629
 she is not normal 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.609
 they left a bit like this but nothing 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.659
 That's why I'm maybe with me 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.659
 to pull out some five ways 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.109
 then you would have to 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.689
 the clock 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.689
 the very expensive but back 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 you go next to the normal countries 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.489
 Haiti continues 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.619
 while 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.329
 He had been cared for here too 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.699
 shown at the end of the video so want the land swept is not like that 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.539
 licked so 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.869
 yes that was too expensive as their slow motion 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:09.719
 percent 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.129
 Making videos without the time has changed 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.129
 Percent Kabul finally please with the wrong way up 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.399
 and 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.889
 apn
