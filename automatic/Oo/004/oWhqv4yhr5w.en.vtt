00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.490 
training which is really really now you
talk<00:01:59.909> about<00:01:59.939> resistance<00:02:00.600> training<00:02:00.899> yeah<00:02:01.259> why

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
talk about resistance training yeah why

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170 
talk about resistance training yeah why
is<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.890> important<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.700> important
