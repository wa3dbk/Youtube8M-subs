is what the brush looks like it looks
like<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.150> traditional<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:20.330> mascara<00:01:21.330> brush

like a traditional kind of mascara brush

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.929 
like a traditional kind of mascara brush
it<00:01:21.990> looks<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> thicker<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> end<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it looks kind of thicker on the end and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.969 
it looks kind of thicker on the end and
kind<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> thinner<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> middle<00:01:25.380> we're

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
kind of thinner in the middle we're

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.410 
kind of thinner in the middle we're
going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> go<00:01:26.280> ahead<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> first<00:01:27.180> coat

and<00:01:27.829> hopefully<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.509> all

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and hopefully I will not get this all

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
and hopefully I will not get this all
over<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:31.229> eyelid<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.250> bad

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
over my eyelid because I'm really bad

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.810 
over my eyelid because I'm really bad
about<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> apply<00:01:33.420> mascara

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.110 

it<00:01:39.330> seems<00:01:39.720> pretty<00:01:40.130> separating<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.790> my

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
it seems pretty separating like my

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.760 
it seems pretty separating like my
lashes<00:01:42.510> don't<00:01:42.810> feel<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.229> they're<00:01:43.380> clumping

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
lashes don't feel like they're clumping

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.050 
lashes don't feel like they're clumping
or<00:01:43.890> anything

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.350 

so<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.260> first<00:01:52.560> coat

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.920

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:18.559 

okay<00:02:09.930> so<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.500> second<00:02:11.160> coat

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.259 

now<00:02:19.469> I<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.799> kind<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.310> feel<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:21.000> third

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.630 
now I do kind of feel like on this third
coat<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.840> my<00:02:21.989> lashes<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.530> getting<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.040> little

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
coat that my lashes are getting a little

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.350 
coat that my lashes are getting a little
bit<00:02:23.760> spatter<00:02:24.060> II<00:02:24.620> look<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.769> little<00:02:26.099> bit<00:02:26.250> clumpy

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.810 

so<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> went<00:02:33.320> ahead<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.590> finished<00:02:34.250> put<00:02:34.400> mascara

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
so I went ahead and finished put mascara

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.140 
so I went ahead and finished put mascara
on<00:02:34.940> my<00:02:35.150> other<00:02:35.300> eye<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:36.320> also<00:02:36.850> curled<00:02:37.850> my

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
on my other eye and I also curled my

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.090 
on my other eye and I also curled my
lashes<00:02:38.180> from<00:02:38.960> what<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.410> tell<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.650> really

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
lashes from what I can tell I really

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.130 
lashes from what I can tell I really
like<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.460> result<00:02:40.610> let<00:02:41.300> me<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.600> go<00:02:41.720> ahead<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
like the result let me just go ahead and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.010 
like the result let me just go ahead and
zoom<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.470> camera<00:02:42.500> out<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.670> only<00:02:44.020> problem

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
zoom the camera out the only problem

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.810 
zoom the camera out the only problem
that<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.260> felt<00:02:45.740> like<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.950> was<00:02:46.070> having<00:02:46.250> while<00:02:46.640> was

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
that I felt like I was having while was

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.000 
that I felt like I was having while was
a<00:02:46.850> planet<00:02:47.390> was<00:02:47.690> once<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.230> get<00:02:48.440> into<00:02:48.770> three

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
a planet was once you get into three

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.100 
a planet was once you get into three
coats<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.550> starts<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.120> get<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> little<00:02:50.390> clumpy

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
coats it starts to get a little clumpy

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.070 
coats it starts to get a little clumpy
so<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.920> might<00:02:52.220> need<00:02:52.460> some<00:02:52.910> type<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.210> old<00:02:53.660> like

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
so you might need some type of old like

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.050 
so you might need some type of old like
spoolie<00:02:54.860> brush<00:02:54.890> or<00:02:55.370> something<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.790> this

it did like it didn't smudge at all so

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.390 
it did like it didn't smudge at all so

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
that was really good

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.480 
that was really good
but<00:04:22.790> this<00:04:22.910> mascara<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.600> definitely<00:04:24.290> very

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
but this mascara is definitely very

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.640 
but this mascara is definitely very
volumizing<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.669> it's<00:04:25.820> very<00:04:26.120> black<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.140> it

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
volumizing and it's very black and it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.280 
volumizing and it's very black and it

definitely gives your lashes that smoky
black<00:04:30.950> lash<00:04:31.460> effect<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.780> says<00:04:33.050> it's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
black lash effect that it says it's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.560 
black lash effect that it says it's
supposed<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.680> give<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.310> do<00:04:34.640> feel<00:04:35.030> like<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.390> does

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
supposed to give I do feel like it does

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.960 
supposed to give I do feel like it does
that<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.230> is<00:04:36.380> really<00:04:36.710> volumizing<00:04:37.640> very

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
that that it is really volumizing very

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.480 
that that it is really volumizing very
black<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.570> make<00:04:39.320> sure<00:04:39.500> eyelashes<00:04:40.310> look

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
black and make sure eyelashes look

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.790 
black and make sure eyelashes look
really<00:04:40.880> smoky<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.140> had<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.440> write<00:04:42.620> this

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
really smoky so if I had to write this

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.129 
really smoky so if I had to write this
mascara<00:04:43.400> from<00:04:43.760> one<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.000> five<00:04:44.150> stars<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.840> would

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
mascara from one to five stars I would

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.719 
mascara from one to five stars I would
probably<00:04:45.530> give<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:46.009> three<00:04:46.249> star<00:04:46.460> rating

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
probably give it a three star rating

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.179 
probably give it a three star rating
just<00:04:47.659> because<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.080> feel<00:04:48.560> like<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:48.949> mascara
