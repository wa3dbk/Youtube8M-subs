tangles knots or curls then using a clip

tangles knots or curls then using a clip
I<00:01:06.479> section<00:01:06.869> off<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> first<00:01:07.320> layer<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> hair

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I section off the first layer of hair

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
I section off the first layer of hair
and<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> section<00:01:09.390> above<00:01:09.659> my

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and I just take the section above my

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
and I just take the section above my
ears<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.170> pin<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.680> top<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.100> head<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
ears and pin it on top of my head and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
ears and pin it on top of my head and
this<00:01:11.909> makes<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.689> easier<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.170> straighten

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this makes it a lot easier to straighten

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
this makes it a lot easier to straighten
because<00:01:13.950> there's<00:01:14.430> less<00:01:14.580> hair<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> work<00:01:15.119> with

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
because there's less hair to work with

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.440 
because there's less hair to work with
and<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> rest<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:17.450> then

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and the rest is out of the way then

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.990 
and the rest is out of the way then
using<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:18.900> chief<00:01:19.170> 44<00:01:19.710> Iron<00:01:20.070> Guard<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
using my chief 44 Iron Guard which is a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
using my chief 44 Iron Guard which is a
heat<00:01:21.240> protectant<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:21.990> spray<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
heat protectant I just spray this

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.810 
heat protectant I just spray this
throughout<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.830> hair<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:23.250> brush<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.520> out

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
throughout my hair and then brush it out

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
throughout my hair and then brush it out
and<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.259> important<00:01:25.770> because

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and this is really important because

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.469 
and this is really important because
this<00:01:26.280> protects<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.790> hair<00:01:26.970> from<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> heat

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this protects your hair from the heat

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
this protects your hair from the heat
because<00:01:27.990> using<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> flat<00:01:28.650> iron<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.070> very

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
because using a flat iron can be very

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.770 
because using a flat iron can be very
damaging<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.119> definitely<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> make

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
damaging so you definitely want to make

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.719 
damaging so you definitely want to make
sure<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:32.130> since<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.579> have

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
sure you do this and then since I have

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
sure you do this and then since I have
super<00:01:32.939> thick<00:01:33.270> hair<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.840> said<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.290> take

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
super thick hair like I said I take

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
super thick hair like I said I take
another<00:01:35.490> section<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.390> hair<00:01:36.420> from<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
another section of my hair from the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
another section of my hair from the
bottom<00:01:37.110> section<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.310> pin<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
bottom section and I just pin this on

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.160 
bottom section and I just pin this on
top<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.210> head<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.930> gives<00:01:39.990> me

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
top of my head and this just gives me

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.260 
top of my head and this just gives me
even<00:01:40.380> less<00:01:41.009> hair<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.520> work<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.850> which<00:01:42.060> makes

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
even less hair to work with which makes

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.899 
even less hair to work with which makes
it<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.509> lot<00:01:42.780> easier<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.549> start

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it a lot easier for me so then I start

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.480 
it a lot easier for me so then I start
to<00:01:45.090> flatter<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:46.590> clamp<00:01:46.920> my<00:01:47.130> pattern

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to flatter and I first clamp my pattern

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.380 
to flatter and I first clamp my pattern
a<00:01:47.640> couple<00:01:47.880> times

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
a couple times

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
a couple times
the<00:01:48.570> roof<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.710> rid<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> curl

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the roof just to get rid of all the curl

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
the roof just to get rid of all the curl
I'm<00:01:50.640> gonna<00:01:50.790> use<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.060> brush<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.300> kind<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.750> guide

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
