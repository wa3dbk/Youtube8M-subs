fiction to to the death of us through

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.590 
fiction to to the death of us through
the<00:00:21.810> pupae<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.350> cause<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> scale<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the pupae to cause a scale so the

other are the symptoms of American fabri
which<00:00:28.800> I've<00:00:29.010> explained<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.029> last<00:00:30.210> video

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
which I've explained in my last video

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.620 
which I've explained in my last video
things<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> perforated<00:00:32.329> cells<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
things like the perforated cells of the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
things like the perforated cells of the
brood<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> change<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.890> color<00:00:35.100> dark<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
brood and the change in color dark and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.720 
brood and the change in color dark and
brood<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> fishy<00:00:37.079> sort<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> odor<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
brood the the fishy sort of odor and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.139 
brood the the fishy sort of odor and
also<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> row<00:00:39.329> penis<00:00:39.629> test<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> basically

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
also the row penis test so basically

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.650 
also the row penis test so basically
what<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.649> lift<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.329> top

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
what you do is you you lift up the top

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.490 
what you do is you you lift up the top
bar<00:00:45.899> frame<00:00:46.489> from<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:47.730> hive<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:48.930> turn

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
bar frame from your hive and then turn

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
bar frame from your hive and then turn
it<00:00:49.620> around<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it around like this so that it's so that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.860 
it around like this so that it's so that
the<00:00:52.260> frame<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> bottom<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.449> you've

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the frame is at the bottom and you've

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.069 
the frame is at the bottom and you've
got<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> comb<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> top<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
got the comb at the top and then it's a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.970 
got the comb at the top and then it's a
matter<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:59.570> adjusting<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.660> head<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
matter of of adjusting your head and the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
matter of of adjusting your head and the
frame<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.390> trying<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> do

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
frame because what you're trying to do

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.760 
frame because what you're trying to do
is<00:01:04.199> look<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.250> lower<00:01:06.110> segment<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is look in the lower segment of that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
is look in the lower segment of that
cell<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> lower<00:01:09.000> wall<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.810> you're

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
cell so the lower wall is what you're

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
cell so the lower wall is what you're
looking<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> where<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
looking for which is where they with a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.600 
looking for which is where they with a
scale<00:01:12.030> will<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
scale will be so what I like to do is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.230 
scale will be so what I like to do is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you're looking for also is a three-door

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.859 
you're looking for also is a three-door
here<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.200> structure<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:50.600> spreading<00:01:51.600> up

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
here like structure that's spreading up

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.660 
here like structure that's spreading up
from<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> bottom<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.890> into<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> top<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
from the bottom up into the top of a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.690 
from the bottom up into the top of a
cell<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.240> basically<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.689> pupil<00:01:55.200> time

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
cell and that's basically the pupil time

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.859 
cell and that's basically the pupil time
and<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and if you see that there is a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
and if you see that there is a
definitive<00:01:58.590> diagnosis<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.430> American<00:02:00.000> foul

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
definitive diagnosis for American foul

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480 
definitive diagnosis for American foul
brood<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.799> matter<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.070> torturing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
brood so it's just a matter of torturing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
brood so it's just a matter of torturing
your<00:02:02.610> head<00:02:02.850> making<00:02:03.479> sure<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> light<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
your head making sure that the light is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
your head making sure that the light is
going<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> cell<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.450> see

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
