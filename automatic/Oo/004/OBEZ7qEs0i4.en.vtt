00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
I am just going to add a little bit of

I am just going to add a little bit of
eco<00:01:31.159> styler<00:01:31.370> gel<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:32.479> my<00:01:32.660> edges<00:01:33.020> just<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.620> make

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
eco styler gel on my edges just to make

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.469 
eco styler gel on my edges just to make
sure<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:34.040> they're<00:01:34.190> laid<00:01:34.400> down<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:35.270> way<00:01:35.360> that

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
sure that they're laid down the way that

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.030 
sure that they're laid down the way that
I<00:01:35.540> want<00:01:35.750> them<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:35.900> lay<00:01:36.110> down<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.410> my<00:01:36.440> hair<00:01:36.770> balls

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.380 

this<00:01:53.079> step<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.380> optional<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.850> use<00:01:55.240> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
this step is optional I to use the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.300 
this step is optional I to use the
denman<00:01:55.630> brush<00:01:55.659> because<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.530> helps<00:01:56.799> to<00:01:56.950> find<00:01:57.159> my

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
denman brush because it helps to find my

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.460 
denman brush because it helps to find my
Swiss<00:01:57.610> tell<00:01:57.790> us<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.939> little<00:01:58.030> bit<00:01:58.180> more<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.689> like

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
Swiss tell us a little bit more I like

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.830 
Swiss tell us a little bit more I like
how<00:01:59.710> it<00:02:00.130> helps<00:02:00.700> come<00:02:00.880> play<00:02:01.000> here<00:02:01.180> together<00:02:01.360> so

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
how it helps come play here together so

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.340 
how it helps come play here together so
it<00:02:02.430> produces<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.700> more<00:02:03.850> defined<00:02:04.149> twist<00:02:04.509> out<00:02:04.780> but

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
it produces a more defined twist out but

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.779 
it produces a more defined twist out but
if<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:05.619> your<00:02:05.799> twist<00:02:06.220> office<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.490> be<00:02:06.549> less

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
if you like your twist office to be less

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.759 
if you like your twist office to be less
define<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.780> don't<00:02:07.930> really<00:02:08.019> care<00:02:08.649> about

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
define and you don't really care about

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.529 
define and you don't really care about
adding<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.429> extra<00:02:09.700> step<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.390> can

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
adding this extra step in then you can

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:22.690 
adding this extra step in then you can
definitely<00:02:10.660> skip<00:02:11.050> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.040 

me

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.890 

you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.690 

so<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:38.260> you're<00:02:38.530> going<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.680> do<00:02:38.829> here<00:02:39.159> is<00:02:39.189> we're

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
so all you're going to do here is we're

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.089 
so all you're going to do here is we're
just<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.209> twist<00:02:40.599> your<00:02:40.870> hair<00:02:41.200> completely

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
just going to twist your hair completely

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.869 
just going to twist your hair completely
around<00:02:42.639> towards<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.480> bottom<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:44.819> try<00:02:45.819> to

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
around towards the bottom and try to

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.000 
around towards the bottom and try to
keep<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.299> as<00:02:46.450> tight<00:02:46.840> as<00:02:47.379> possible<00:02:47.469> without

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
keep it as tight as possible without

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.470 
keep it as tight as possible without
pulling<00:02:48.489> on<00:02:48.730> air<00:02:48.849> or<00:02:48.879> being<00:02:49.120> too<00:02:49.150> harsh

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
pulling on air or being too harsh

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.149 
pulling on air or being too harsh
because<00:02:49.780> your<00:02:50.049> hair<00:02:50.290> does<00:02:50.620> loosen<00:02:51.010> up<00:02:51.099> a

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
because your hair does loosen up a

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.069 
because your hair does loosen up a
little<00:02:51.280> bit<00:02:51.489> once<00:02:51.849> that's<00:02:52.480> what<00:02:52.719> style<00:02:52.930> is

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
little bit once that's what style is

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:01.070 
little bit once that's what style is
complete<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.430> complete<00:02:54.760> dry

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.860 

I<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:02.430> started<00:03:02.730> doing<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> new<00:03:03.270> method<00:03:03.660> where

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
I have started doing a new method where

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.050 
I have started doing a new method where
instead<00:03:04.710> of<00:03:04.770> twisting<00:03:05.280> my<00:03:05.430> hair<00:03:05.460> all<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:05.940> way

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
instead of twisting my hair all the way

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.720 
instead of twisting my hair all the way
down<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.690> stopped<00:03:07.440> Midway<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.220> coil<00:03:08.550> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
down I stopped Midway and I coil it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.090 
down I stopped Midway and I coil it
around<00:03:09.030> my<00:03:09.150> finger<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.810> gives<00:03:10.230> more<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.770> a

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
around my finger it gives more of a

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.120 
around my finger it gives more of a
spiral<00:03:11.640> curl<00:03:12.030> once<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:13.230> Swiss<00:03:13.770> thoughts<00:03:13.950> are

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
spiral curl once the Swiss thoughts are

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.370 
spiral curl once the Swiss thoughts are
dry<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.700> run<00:03:14.910> rebel<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> think

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
dry and you run rebel then so I think

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.650 
dry and you run rebel then so I think
it's<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:17.010> cute<00:03:17.280> add<00:03:17.460> just<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.000> prefer<00:03:18.360> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
it's really cute add just I prefer it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.270 
it's really cute add just I prefer it
more<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.110> just<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:19.620> at<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.800> coil<00:03:20.040> if

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
more so I just do more at the coil if

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.460 
more so I just do more at the coil if
