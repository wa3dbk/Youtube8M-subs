the finishing this video up so um why

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
the finishing this video up so um why
don't<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.590> said<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.159> show<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
don't I do what I said and show you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.429 
don't I do what I said and show you
these<00:02:02.729> metals<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> listen<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.290> them

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
these metals and what you listen to them

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.059 
these metals and what you listen to them
so<00:02:05.040> let's<00:02:05.490> start<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> set

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
so let's start out with on this set

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.919 
so let's start out with on this set
first<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.060> regular<00:02:09.420> ones<00:02:09.629> because

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
first the the regular ones because

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.100 
first the the regular ones because
they're<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:10.739> really

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
they're not really

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.680 
they're not really
to<00:02:11.290> say<00:02:11.440> about<00:02:11.560> them<00:02:11.920> they<00:02:12.490> have<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.000> diecast

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
to say about them they have that diecast

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.630 
to say about them they have that diecast
to<00:02:13.990> them<00:02:14.140> again<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.440> guess<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:15.010> feels<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.460> it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
to them again I guess it feels like it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640 
to them again I guess it feels like it
at<00:02:15.730> least<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.960> some<00:02:17.110> reason<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.530> me

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
at least it just for some reason to me

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.180 
at least it just for some reason to me
on<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:19.570> DX<00:02:19.930> one<00:02:20.170> still<00:02:20.410> feel<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:20.740> bit

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
on the DX one still feel a little bit

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.800 
on the DX one still feel a little bit
heavier<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.850> don't<00:02:22.150> know<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.270> should<00:02:22.570> get<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.750> a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
heavier I don't know I should get like a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.260 
heavier I don't know I should get like a
scale<00:02:23.200> or<00:02:23.230> something<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:24.130> kind<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.880> check<00:02:25.090> on

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
scale or something to kind of check on

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.700 
scale or something to kind of check on
that<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.750> kind<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.080> feels<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.500> way

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
that but it just kind of feels that way

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.740 
that but it just kind of feels that way
to<00:02:26.740> me<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.520> they<00:02:27.670> might<00:02:27.850> still<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> little

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
to me so they might still be a little

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.990 
to me so they might still be a little
bit<00:02:29.200> nicer<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.770> DX<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.520> these<00:02:30.640> are<00:02:30.790> still

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
bit nicer on the DX but these are still

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.590 
bit nicer on the DX but these are still
pretty<00:02:31.180> nice<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:33.760> have<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.390> back

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
pretty nice and they have on the back

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.740 
pretty nice and they have on the back
just<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.170> three<00:02:35.470> stars<00:02:35.740> across<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:37.360> can<00:02:37.480> see

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
just like three stars across you can see

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.320 
just like three stars across you can see
it<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> same<00:02:39.250> no<00:02:39.490> matter<00:02:39.610> whether<00:02:40.090> it's

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
it it's the same no matter whether it's

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.070 
it it's the same no matter whether it's
a<00:02:40.390> head<00:02:40.600> body<00:02:41.290> or<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:42.280> feet<00:02:42.640> metal<00:02:43.510> whatever

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
a head body or like feet metal whatever

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.350 
a head body or like feet metal whatever
you<00:02:44.200> want<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.440> call<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.040> has<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:45.940> one

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
you want to call it it just has that one

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.710 
you want to call it it just has that one
strip<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.870> has<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.140> stars<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:48.660> okay<00:02:49.660> so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
strip that has the stars so okay so

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.479 
strip that has the stars so okay so
these<00:02:50.020> are<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.440> pretty<00:02:50.620> much<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> same<00:02:51.190> deal

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
these are just pretty much the same deal

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.100 
these are just pretty much the same deal
as<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:52.030> other<00:02:52.180> ones<00:02:52.420> I've<00:02:52.600> already<00:02:52.780> showed

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
as the other ones I've already showed

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:06.660 
as the other ones I've already showed
you<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.560> taka<00:02:54.840> Torah<00:02:58.860> bassa<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:02.370> comic<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:05.670> so

you so taka Torah bassa and comic a so
there's<00:03:07.180> those<00:03:07.450> ones<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:09.550> have

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
there's those ones and then we have

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:27.780 
there's those ones and then we have
ryouki<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:19.120> have<00:03:20.310> Riga<00:03:26.010> now<00:03:27.010> if<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.430> listen<00:03:27.760> to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
ryouki we have Riga now if you listen to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.470 
ryouki we have Riga now if you listen to
that<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:29.709> makes<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.070> sound<00:03:30.459> whereas<00:03:31.209> all<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
that it makes that sound whereas all the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.190 
that it makes that sound whereas all the
other<00:03:31.750> ones<00:03:32.670> make<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.850> sound<00:03:34.239> now<00:03:35.019> that's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
other ones make that sound now that's

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.530 
other ones make that sound now that's
what<00:03:35.350> all<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.709> core<00:03:35.950> metal<00:03:36.250> sound<00:03:36.549> like<00:03:36.820> but

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
what all the core metal sound like but

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:47.070 
what all the core metal sound like but
this<00:03:42.390> grab<00:03:43.390> one<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.750> cell<00:03:44.140> metal<00:03:46.080> see

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
this grab one of the cell metal see

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.660 
this grab one of the cell metal see
that's<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.440> cell<00:03:47.680> metal<00:03:47.980> sound<00:03:48.250> I'm<00:03:48.489> not<00:03:48.610> sure

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
that's the cell metal sound I'm not sure

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.190 
that's the cell metal sound I'm not sure
why<00:03:49.000> they<00:03:49.180> did<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.390> for<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.720> dark<00:03:49.930> rider

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
why they did that for the dark rider

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.390 
why they did that for the dark rider
maybe<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.830> because<00:03:50.980> they're<00:03:51.130> trying<00:03:51.370> to

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
maybe just because they're trying to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.360 
maybe just because they're trying to
make<00:03:51.489> them<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:52.540> kind<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.840> separate<00:03:53.799> from<00:03:54.130> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
make them just kind of separate from the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.970 
make them just kind of separate from the
other<00:03:54.519> core<00:03:55.180> metals<00:03:55.510> but<00:03:55.810> regardless<00:03:56.650> it

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
other core metals but regardless it

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.150 
other core metals but regardless it
makes<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.489> cell<00:03:58.269> metal<00:03:58.540> sound<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.040> have

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
makes the cell metal sound can we have

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.180 
makes the cell metal sound can we have
five

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:18.870 

we<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.310> Kiba<00:04:12.570> there<00:04:13.570> we<00:04:13.660> go<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:18.010> last<00:04:18.760> but

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
we have Kiba there we go and last but

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.970 
we have Kiba there we go and last but
not<00:04:19.090> least<00:04:19.150> double<00:04:24.150> as<00:04:25.150> far<00:04:25.360> as<00:04:25.480> combinations

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
not least double as far as combinations

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.200 
not least double as far as combinations
let<00:04:26.980> me<00:04:27.070> see<00:04:27.220> if<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.520> get<00:04:27.670> some<00:04:27.730> of<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> ones

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
let me see if I can get some of the ones

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.620 
let me see if I can get some of the ones
that<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.510> managed<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.290> come<00:04:29.770> up<00:04:29.800> with<00:04:30.630> Mookie

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
that I managed to come up with Mookie

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.870 
that I managed to come up with Mookie
and<00:04:31.750> kiva<00:04:32.140> gave<00:04:32.440> me<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> Guiteau<00:04:33.010> which<00:04:33.730> was

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
and kiva gave me a Guiteau which was

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.610 
and kiva gave me a Guiteau which was
exciting<00:04:34.180> at<00:04:34.450> first<00:04:34.480> because<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.290> was<00:04:35.380> like<00:04:35.500> oh

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
exciting at first because I was like oh

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.490
