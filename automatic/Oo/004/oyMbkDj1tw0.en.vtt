00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.410
 organic essentials and I'll get you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.719
 show how thanks to oils 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 essentials soothe a restless child 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.590
 you know young children and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 younger and especially babies 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.000
 are very often very agitated at night 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.070
 after busy days it is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 often very difficult to calm them down and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 I will show you with two formulas 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.349
 very simple how to appease them so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.900
 we will choose oils 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 essential relaxing 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.270
 watch out all the essential oils 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.719
 can not be used at the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.730
 young child 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 we will choose lavender 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 officinale and we will also take into 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.670
 organic essential oils of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.899
 tangerine so with these two oils 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.809
 essential I am going first 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.059
 propose a formula to spread I have here 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.770
 a broadcaster so it's a broadcaster that 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 is at the same time air humidifiers 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.620
 but you can also take a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 classic oil diffuser 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.840
 essential 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.610
 what is important is to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 always take a device that does not 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.670
 not heat the oils to conserve 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.039
 all are worth all their virtues 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.350
 by non-therapeutic and in particular 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.049
 their relaxing virtues 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:16.619
 I will put in this diffuser that 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:19.320
 I turn on the water so the broadcaster 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.140
 turn on and you see the steam 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.970
 of water that wants to tell me proud air this 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 diffuser does not heat up in this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.880
 diffuser I'm going to put 30 drops 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 of lavender essential oil 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 biological officinale and then 30 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.229
 drops of essential oils 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.229
 organic tangerine 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 here you can let it spread 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.799
 for 15 minutes an hour before the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.299
 child's sleep in the room with 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.220
 these same two essential oils we 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.890
 can also perform a massage for 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.590
 massage your baby or your child 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.710
 baby from 3 months old then you 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.149
 take a vegetable oil preferably 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.490
 biological I took there from the core 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.070
 apricot and I'm going to put in my 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.310
 bottle of 50 milliliters 1 milliliter of 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.289
 lavender and a milliliter of mandarin 1 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.310
 milliliter equals 30 drops of oil 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.720
 essential lavender 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:22.580
 so I count 30 drops of oil 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:26.640
 Lavender essential to this 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.830
 and then I want to put 30 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.940
 drops of essential oils from 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.940
 organic tangerine 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.750
 I redo my bottle 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 I mix energetically 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.590
 so you have a massage oil for 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.930
 relax the young child and the baby to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.970

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.280

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.230
 citrus essential tangerine 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.420
 so do not use it before 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.640
 sun exposure wait three 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.590
