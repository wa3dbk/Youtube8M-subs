it should look and feel like an
authentic<00:01:14.440> 1960s<00:01:15.440> bike<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.760> should<00:01:16.940> have

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
authentic 1960s bike but it should have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.430 
authentic 1960s bike but it should have
all<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.390> modern<00:01:17.600> convenience<00:01:18.140> and

nowadays<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.979> need<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.760> keep<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.479> feel<00:01:23.780> and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
nowadays you need to keep the feel and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.140 
nowadays you need to keep the feel and
the<00:01:24.110> style<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.770> machine<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:25.400> obviously

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
the style of the machine but obviously

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.080 
the style of the machine but obviously
you<00:01:26.840> don't<00:01:27.200> want<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.560> 1960s<00:01:28.369> motorcycle<00:01:28.940> now

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
you don't want a 1960s motorcycle now

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.060 
you don't want a 1960s motorcycle now
because<00:01:29.510> you<00:01:30.290> know<00:01:30.410> to<00:01:30.470> be<00:01:30.650> honest<00:01:30.950> they

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
because you know to be honest they

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.200 
because you know to be honest they
leaked<00:01:31.310> oil<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.790> they<00:01:31.850> weren't<00:01:32.030> that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
leaked oil and they weren't that

new Bonneville is scheming out the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.830 
new Bonneville is scheming out the
components<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.280> they<00:01:37.520> work<00:01:38.060> well<00:01:38.450> within

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
components so that they work well within

the look of the bike that you fixed too

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.420 
the look of the bike that you fixed too
it<00:01:42.470> was<00:01:42.560> actually<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.860> quite<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.250> difficult

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
it was actually a quite a difficult

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.060 
it was actually a quite a difficult
process<00:01:43.790> because<00:01:44.240> we're<00:01:44.390> starting<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:45.070> an

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
process because we're starting with an

process because we're starting with an
agreed<00:01:46.790> look<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.330> bike<00:01:47.479> has<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.780> look<00:01:47.930> like

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
agreed look the bike has to look like

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.410 
agreed look the bike has to look like
that<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:49.220> has<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.520> correctly<00:01:49.880> proportioned

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
that it has to be correctly proportioned

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.940 
that it has to be correctly proportioned
and<00:01:50.540> yet<00:01:50.960> we<00:01:51.050> have<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.320> fit<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.650> all<00:01:51.830> these

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
and yet we have to fit in all these

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.770 
and yet we have to fit in all these
additional<00:01:52.460> components<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.660> original

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
additional components that the original

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.560 
additional components that the original
designers<00:01:54.320> didn't<00:01:54.560> have<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:55.509> there's<00:01:56.509> a

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
designers didn't have to do there's a

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.410 
designers didn't have to do there's a

lot of real triumph enthusiasts who we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.419 
lot of real triumph enthusiasts who we
knew<00:01:59.690> would<00:01:59.869> want<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.229> bike<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.590> be<00:02:00.710> very<00:02:01.220> very

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
knew would want the bike to be very very

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.969 
knew would want the bike to be very very
close<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:01.940> authentic<00:02:02.420> bike<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:03.590> was<00:02:03.800> a

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
close to the authentic bike it was a

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.770 
close to the authentic bike it was a
given<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:04.520> had<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.850> keep<00:02:05.030> certain<00:02:05.090> key

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
given that we had to keep certain key

given that we had to keep certain key
styling<00:02:06.619> features<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.399> for<00:02:07.640> example<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.999 
styling features like for example the
silence<00:02:08.509> as<00:02:08.660> these<00:02:08.810> peashooter<00:02:09.500> design<00:02:09.770> so

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
silence as these peashooter design so

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.830 
silence as these peashooter design so
they<00:02:10.100> start<00:02:10.369> narrow<00:02:10.700> they<00:02:11.210> get<00:02:11.390> fatter<00:02:11.630> than

they<00:02:11.960> narrow<00:02:12.380> down<00:02:12.620> again<00:02:12.920> that's<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.220> very

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
they narrow down again that's a very

feel relaxed when you're riding it it's
just<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.850> good<00:02:42.030> all-round<00:02:42.330> package

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.210 

on<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.640> daytona<00:02:50.970> project<00:02:51.390> we<00:02:51.480> started<00:02:51.510> with

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
on the daytona project we started with

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.940 
on the daytona project we started with
drawings<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.400> profile<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.330> bike<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:55.650> chose

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
drawings in profile of the bike we chose

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.670 
drawings in profile of the bike we chose
the<00:02:56.849> best<00:02:57.000> drawing<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.599> one<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.840> wanted<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the best drawing the one we wanted to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.740 
the best drawing the one we wanted to
continue<00:02:59.069> with<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.790> translated<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.450> into<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
continue with we translated that into a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
continue with we translated that into a
full-scale<00:03:01.170> mock-up<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.489> bike<00:03:02.670> which<00:03:02.970> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
full-scale mock-up of the bike which is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.070 
full-scale mock-up of the bike which is
made<00:03:03.300> out<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.560> clay<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.590> plaster<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.730> metal

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
made out of clay and plaster and metal

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.479 
made out of clay and plaster and metal
so<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.110> looks<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> fully<00:03:08.010> finished<00:03:08.190> bike

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
so it looks like a fully finished bike

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.610 
so it looks like a fully finished bike
and<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.790> looked<00:03:09.030> perfect<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.900> said<00:03:10.050> yes<00:03:10.260> that's

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and it looked perfect we said yes that's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920 
and it looked perfect we said yes that's
exactly<00:03:10.800> what<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.190> want<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.520> make<00:03:11.750> we<00:03:12.750> then

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
exactly what I want to make we then

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.470 
exactly what I want to make we then
moved<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:14.030> translating<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.330> that

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
moved to translating all that

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.350 
moved to translating all that
information<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:16.140> those<00:03:16.319> shapes<00:03:16.590> into

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
information all those shapes into

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.570 
information all those shapes into
computer<00:03:18.360> models<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.260> we<00:03:19.380> made<00:03:19.590> pro<00:03:20.400> engineer

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
computer models so we made pro engineer

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.140 
computer models so we made pro engineer
CAD<00:03:21.330> models<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.870> every<00:03:22.140> single<00:03:22.410> component

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
CAD models of every single component

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.580 
CAD models of every single component
then<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.300> moved<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> actually<00:03:25.230> making<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
then we moved on to actually making the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.740 
then we moved on to actually making the
parts<00:03:25.980> from<00:03:26.190> those<00:03:26.400> CAD<00:03:26.880> models<00:03:29.150> any<00:03:30.150> Mike

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
parts of the bike that you see to make

parts of the bike that you see to make
it<00:03:38.370> look<00:03:38.540> beautiful<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.830> team<00:03:41.160> of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
it look beautiful and a team of

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.970 
it look beautiful and a team of
approximately<00:03:42.600> 15<00:03:42.900> engineers<00:03:43.350> who<00:03:43.620> work<00:03:43.799> on

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
approximately 15 engineers who work on

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.860 
approximately 15 engineers who work on
the<00:03:44.069> engine<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.610> on<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.150> chassis<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:45.720> they're

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
the engine and on the chassis so they're

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.300 
the engine and on the chassis so they're
two<00:03:46.080> separate<00:03:46.410> teams<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:46.860> obviously<00:03:47.130> they

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
two separate teams but obviously they

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.160 
two separate teams but obviously they
talk<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.670> each<00:03:47.700> other<00:03:47.850> quite<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.420> lot<00:03:51.170> we

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
talk to each other quite a lot we

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.319 
talk to each other quite a lot we
decided<00:03:52.500> fairly<00:03:52.920> early<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.459> some<00:03:54.060> major

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
decided fairly early on on some major

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.140 
decided fairly early on on some major
features<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.680> wanted<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.250> silencer<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.060> be

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
features we wanted the silencer to be

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.699 
features we wanted the silencer to be
under<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.570> seat<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.079> that's<00:03:58.200> centrally

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
under the seat so that's centrally

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.710 
under the seat so that's centrally
placed<00:03:58.920> above<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.310> rear<00:03:59.519> wheel<00:03:59.760> instead<00:04:00.570> of

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
placed above the rear wheel instead of

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.870 
placed above the rear wheel instead of
down<00:04:01.260> at<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.470> side<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.829> bike<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.700> thought

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
down at the side of the bike we thought

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.370 
down at the side of the bike we thought
that<00:04:03.030> would<00:04:03.120> give<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> bike<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.720> very<00:04:04.230> good

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
that would give the bike a very good

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.240 
that would give the bike a very good
look<00:04:04.560> we<00:04:05.310> wanted<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:06.209> very<00:04:06.859> functional<00:04:07.859> he<00:04:08.160> had

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
look we wanted a very functional he had

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.940 
look we wanted a very functional he had
also<00:04:08.400> heavily<00:04:08.940> styled<00:04:09.630> frame<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.620> frame

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
also heavily styled frame so the frame

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.550 
also heavily styled frame so the frame
that<00:04:11.190> goes<00:04:11.220> over<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.940> top<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.299> engine<00:04:12.560> is

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
that goes over the top of the engine is

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.069 
that goes over the top of the engine is
fully<00:04:14.310> style<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:14.880> not<00:04:15.000> just<00:04:15.269> made<00:04:15.840> from

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
fully style it's not just made from

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.539 
fully style it's not just made from
straight<00:04:16.380> sides<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:16.919> got<00:04:17.010> some<00:04:17.370> lovely

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
straight sides it's got some lovely

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.870 
straight sides it's got some lovely
curves<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.180> swoops

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
