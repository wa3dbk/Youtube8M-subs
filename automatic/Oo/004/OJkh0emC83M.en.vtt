00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.210 
thought that you towards the end I know
it<00:01:48.570> actually<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.110> evenly<00:01:49.500> split<00:01:49.890> for

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it actually was pretty evenly split for

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.630 
it actually was pretty evenly split for
me<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.610> until<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.299> don't<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.960> maybe<00:01:52.170> issue<00:01:52.799> for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
me up until I don't know maybe issue for

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.030 
me up until I don't know maybe issue for
sure<00:01:54.450> maybe<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.930> swung<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.860> yeah

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
sure maybe it swung back but yeah

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.560 
sure maybe it swung back but yeah
towards<00:01:56.460> towards<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> end<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.030> would<00:01:57.149> agree<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
towards towards the end I would agree I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.170 
towards towards the end I would agree I
do<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.780> love<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.799> mystery<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.610> book<00:01:59.969> like
