00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.740
 johann ott and welcome to 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
 very last group pack opening to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 team on the shoot after that is the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 eternal series finally free finally over 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 Unfortunately, that's over 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.320
 the team on the shooting is in front of us 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.270
 have another two days 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 it goes to sunday the team on the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.750
 shoot here we can briefly 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.609
 watch all the players so that everyone 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 players make the best of every team 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 this together is so blatant 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 if you give that yego kosta rodrigues 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.719
 filipe luis code rabbi bag lying 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.579
 regret story ronaldo messi robben suárez 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.660
 and ibrahimovic if we have one of 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.059
 pull these players 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.280
 that was incredibly a really good one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.079
 statements we would, I assume 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:55.010
 the 15km ex re-release here 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:57.660
 no not yet but 35 degrees was effective 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.070
 okay then we do not pull 15 degrees up 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.930
 I did not think he was that great 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 then we'll move 35 degrees 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.540
 want to be there in the blue player and that will 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.760
 be the last group game said 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.990
 very short if even pixi wanted this 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.280
 crass team on the this puts you 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.049
 nevertheless you could in the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 description buy at mmo kia or 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 cheap coins very fast and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.780
 reliable as well psn cards microsoft 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.240
 Anything else could buy gold 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.369
 Now let's start with the first 35 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 We think we only have three pieces 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.659
 piece of commercial then you are the coens 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.990

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:51.540
 sahin-scholl sahin ericsson very many 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 contracts shadow okay the first pack was 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.270
 never anything but we have two more 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.850
 By the way, try ending the end if you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.009
 this here so that he can see finished 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.329
 aim and sell that I will have a few 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.430
 Weeks I think a two weeks 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.110
 need to sell everything and then 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.300
 can those who paid in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.670
 have either youtube or on facebook 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.350
 still best to contact me for her 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.760
 get your coins back 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.140
 and if we do not do it right now and she 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.610
 then you will probably with a tight 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.000
 come out minus but not so bad 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.290
 I think maybe two third 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.060
 we could come back estimated 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.240
 Half the time, that's what they're looking at 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.100
 wrap something blue and do it there 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.400
 Do you do it was also blue why 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:45.210
 is a course at here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:50.850
 rare contracts grandma my last pack 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.820
 one last chance one last chance 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.560
 Here something good to draw 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.480
 then have 5000 effect or so then 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.230
 that will be also and the last anni 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.270
 as well as places would still be 1 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.850
 available but we do not have one anymore 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.630
 and that's why it's the last and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.880
 This time still blue please kießling 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.510
 that was really bad 35 again 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.510
 capex here 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.400
 if you wanted more luck like me 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.950

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.090

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.620

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.020
 group head we have some 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.240
 despite pulled four of the piece loose if 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.710
 I was about four pieces on 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.630
 Anyway, I would say halfway 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.390
 successful not quite not great though 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.180
 it was halfway successful 1 75 can 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.890
 we still and if again and again groups 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.400
 wanted to see pack opening from me to like 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.900

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.010

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.650

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.450

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.670
 me from the last couple of the team up 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.740
