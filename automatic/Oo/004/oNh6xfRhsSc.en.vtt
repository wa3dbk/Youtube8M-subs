but<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.069> little<00:01:21.340> bit<00:01:21.490> more<00:01:21.700> about<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
but this is a little bit more about the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.300 
but this is a little bit more about the
product<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.899> can<00:01:23.170> just<00:01:23.349> pause<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.099> read

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
product you can just pause this and read

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.929 
product you can just pause this and read
it<00:01:25.440> but<00:01:26.440> natural

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.830 

really<00:01:32.720> nice<00:01:32.869> kind<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.260> natural<00:01:33.710> size<00:01:33.979> line

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
really nice kind of natural size line

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.289 
really nice kind of natural size line
anyways<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.140> last<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.950> really<00:01:37.400> long<00:01:37.610> time<00:01:37.970> and

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
anyways this last a really long time and

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.550 
anyways this last a really long time and
so<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.900> is<00:01:39.430> 21<00:01:40.430> fluid<00:01:41.150> ounces<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.200> think

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
so this is 21 fluid ounces and I think

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.740 
so this is 21 fluid ounces and I think
it's<00:01:42.770> less<00:01:43.190> than<00:01:43.490> five<00:01:43.729> dollars<00:01:44.000> for<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
it's less than five dollars for the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.350 
it's less than five dollars for the
bottle<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.530> made<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.070> inexpensive<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.119> so

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
bottle it made so inexpensive but so

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.450 
bottle it made so inexpensive but so
good<00:01:47.570> at<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.840> same<00:01:47.869> time<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.409> don't<00:01:48.830> even<00:01:49.070> know

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
good at the same time I don't even know

another thing that I really love about
this<00:02:38.000> moisturizer<00:02:38.600> is<00:02:38.989> because<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.739> that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
this moisturizer is because it's on that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.250 
this moisturizer is because it's on that
sheer<00:02:40.340> kind<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:40.940> side<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.540> not<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:42.019> that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
sheer kind of side it's not like that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.930 
sheer kind of side it's not like that
opaque<00:02:42.920> white<00:02:43.820> cream<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.950> blends<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.430> super

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
swipe and forget about it and so it's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.130

it's<00:03:49.630> been<00:03:50.319> around<00:03:50.590> st.<00:03:51.370> Ives<00:03:51.550> has<00:03:51.849> been

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
it's been around st. Ives has been

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.180 
it's been around st. Ives has been
around<00:03:52.239> for<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> really<00:03:52.690> long<00:03:52.900> time<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.739> I

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
around for a really long time and I

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.100 
around for a really long time and I
really<00:03:54.520> like<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:54.970> oatmeal<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.630> shea<00:03:55.840> butter

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
really like this oatmeal and shea butter

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.760 
really like this oatmeal and shea butter
line<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:57.640> does<00:03:57.849> have<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.540> little<00:03:59.380> bit<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.620> that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
line it does have a little bit of that

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.220 
line it does have a little bit of that
Shea<00:04:00.160> smell<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.819> it<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:01.180> shea<00:04:01.420> butter<00:04:01.750> smell

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
Shea smell to it that shea butter smell

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.590 
Shea smell to it that shea butter smell
but<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:02.860> very<00:04:03.010> light<00:04:03.459> it's<00:04:03.940> not<00:04:04.030> super

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
but it's very light it's not super

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300 
but it's very light it's not super
strong<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.440> think<00:04:05.709> that's<00:04:05.830> another<00:04:06.069> thing

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
strong so I think that's another thing
