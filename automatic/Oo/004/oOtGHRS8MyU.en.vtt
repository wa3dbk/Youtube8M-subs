00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.500 
it somewhere in the middle
perhaps<00:04:14.720> more<00:04:15.190> at<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:17.090> end<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:18.530> this

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
perhaps more at the the end like this

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.030 
perhaps more at the the end like this
near<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.540> bottom<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:23.140> now<00:04:24.140> you<00:04:24.500> flip<00:04:24.830> over

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
near the bottom and now you flip over

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.950 
near the bottom and now you flip over
the<00:04:25.370> deck<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:27.220> then<00:04:28.300> give<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.840> deck<00:04:30.110> account

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
the deck and then give the deck account

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.870 
the deck and then give the deck account
then<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.169> are<00:04:33.290> telling<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:34.160> want<00:04:34.760> to

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
then you are telling that you want to

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.640 
then you are telling that you want to
put<00:04:35.180> out<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.690> chameleon<00:04:36.200> count<00:04:36.440> again<00:04:36.800> and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
put out the chameleon count again and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.100 
put out the chameleon count again and
when<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.800> cut<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.310> deck<00:04:40.550> with<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.300> three

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
when you cut the deck with the three

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.540 
when you cut the deck with the three
thirds<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.100> deck<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:44.290> will<00:04:45.290> first<00:04:45.740> see

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
thirds of the deck you will first see

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:56.340 
thirds of the deck you will first see
the<00:04:49.419> blue<00:04:50.419> back<00:04:51.290> count<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:54.910> twelve-ounce

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
the blue back count of the twelve-ounce

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.750 
the blue back count of the twelve-ounce
because<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.840> red<00:05:00.140> back<00:05:00.440> comes<00:05:00.890> later<00:05:01.250> on<00:05:01.550> in

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
because the red back comes later on in

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.750 
because the red back comes later on in
the<00:05:01.880> deck<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:02.900> it's<00:05:03.050> very<00:05:03.289> important<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.250> when

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
the deck so it's very important and when

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.200 
the deck so it's very important and when
you<00:05:05.000> are<00:05:05.090> cutting<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:06.260> are<00:05:06.470> that<00:05:07.310> you're<00:05:07.940> made

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
you are cutting you are that you're made

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.740 
you are cutting you are that you're made
a<00:05:08.890> 3/3<00:05:09.890> of<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.430> tundish<00:05:10.820> I<00:05:11.060> will<00:05:11.330> show<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.510> you

a 3/3 of the tundish I will show to you

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.420 
a 3/3 of the tundish I will show to you
again<00:05:12.190> later

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
again later

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.659 
again later
I<00:05:13.669> know<00:05:14.630> everything<00:05:16.030> every<00:05:17.030> trick<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.750> over

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669

back and show that these counts changes

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.290 
back and show that these counts changes
the<00:05:27.740> kana<00:05:29.350> so<00:05:30.350> what<00:05:30.919> I<00:05:30.950> meant<00:05:31.340> were<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.580> three
