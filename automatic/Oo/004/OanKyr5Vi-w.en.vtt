good<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> reinforce<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:58.860> extra

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
good to reinforce it with some extra

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.740 
good to reinforce it with some extra
papers<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> I've<00:00:59.850> trimmed<00:01:00.090> those<00:01:00.300> two<00:01:00.510> four

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
papers so I've trimmed those two four

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
papers so I've trimmed those two four
and<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> half<00:01:00.899> by<00:01:01.260> six<00:01:01.500> inches<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.699> will

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and a half by six inches and those will

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
and a half by six inches and those will
go<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> outside<00:01:03.510> front<00:01:03.989> covers<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.619> then

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
go on the outside front covers and then

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.969 
go on the outside front covers and then
I<00:01:05.550> prepared<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.300> spine<00:01:06.570> piece<00:01:06.899> too<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.860> I'm

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I prepared a spine piece too but I'm

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.249 
I prepared a spine piece too but I'm
rounding<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> corner<00:01:09.660> shopper<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.140> we

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
rounding with the corner shopper from we

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.690 
rounding with the corner shopper from we
are<00:01:10.350> memory<00:01:10.380> keepers<00:01:10.649> just<00:01:10.979> rounding<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
are memory keepers just rounding the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
are memory keepers just rounding the
outside<00:01:12.180> corners<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.899> this<00:01:13.619> case<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.459> thought

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
outside corners of this case I thought

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
outside corners of this case I thought
it<00:01:14.729> would<00:01:14.849> just<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.179> of<00:01:15.390> kick<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.349> a<00:01:16.470> notch

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it would just kind of kick it up a notch

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
it would just kind of kick it up a notch
a<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.099> and<00:01:17.310> I'm<00:01:17.970> using<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.300> half<00:01:18.509> inch

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
a little bit and I'm using the half inch

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
a little bit and I'm using the half inch
setting<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.319> punch<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
setting on the punch and then with the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.900 
setting on the punch and then with the
the<00:01:22.110> nesting<00:01:22.679> panels<00:01:23.069> for<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> cover<00:01:23.729> I'm

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
the nesting panels for the cover I'm

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.790 
the nesting panels for the cover I'm
just<00:01:24.119> rounding<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.780> corresponding<00:01:25.500> corner

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
just rounding the corresponding corner

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.430 
just rounding the corresponding corner
so<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.039> just<00:01:26.220> two<00:01:26.580> corners<00:01:26.910> there<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.539> with

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
so it's just two corners there and with

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.109 
so it's just two corners there and with
my<00:01:28.590> trusty<00:01:29.069> ATG<00:01:29.729> adhesive<00:01:30.569> I<00:01:30.959> will<00:01:31.709> nest<00:01:32.369> that

my trusty ATG adhesive I will nest that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.350

up the sidewall of the box and I like
how<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.470> reinforces<00:03:10.099> it<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.340> little<00:03:10.489> bit<00:03:10.640> too

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
how it reinforces it a little bit too

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.860

tack it together and it's a little

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.400 
tack it together and it's a little
makeshift<00:03:19.220> container<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.239> hold<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.690> cards

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.860 
the short edges and 1/2 inch in from one
long<00:04:12.470> edge<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.160> then<00:04:13.850> MITRE<00:04:14.359> away<00:04:14.690> the

long edge and then MITRE away the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.050

corners<00:04:15.290> bringing<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.280> scissors<00:04:16.669> right

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
corners bringing the scissors right

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.969 
corners bringing the scissors right
through<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.570> spot<00:04:18.139> where<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.440> score<00:04:18.769> lines

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
through the spot where the score lines

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.370 
through the spot where the score lines
intersect<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:19.880> then<00:04:20.660> fold<00:04:20.959> along<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.350> score

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
intersect and then fold along the score

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.860 
intersect and then fold along the score
lines<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:22.100> order<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.430> make<00:04:22.610> three<00:04:23.479> little

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
lines in order to make three little

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.840 
lines in order to make three little
flaps

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.080 

I'll<00:04:27.690> take<00:04:27.870> my<00:04:27.960> ATG<00:04:28.500> gun<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.040> put<00:04:29.610> adhesive<00:04:29.730> on

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
I'll take my ATG gun and put adhesive on

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.240 
I'll take my ATG gun and put adhesive on
the<00:04:30.210> flaps<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:31.260> might<00:04:31.410> want<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.680> use<00:04:31.890> a

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
the flaps you might want to use a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.220 
the flaps you might want to use a
smaller<00:04:33.060> adhesive<00:04:33.600> but<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
smaller adhesive but I just like the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.200 
smaller adhesive but I just like the
strength<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.740> ATG<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.460> know<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.000> lot<00:04:36.180> of

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
strength of the ATG I know a lot of

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.820 
strength of the ATG I know a lot of
folks<00:04:36.450> use<00:04:36.660> score<00:04:36.930> tape<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.440> works<00:04:37.620> very

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
folks use score tape and that works very

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.370 
folks use score tape and that works very
well<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:39.210> I'll<00:04:39.270> just<00:04:39.390> put<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:39.690> right<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:40.350> top

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
well so I'll just put this right on top

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.990 
well so I'll just put this right on top
of<00:04:40.940> my<00:04:41.940> pocket<00:04:42.360> for<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.470> cards<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.190> then<00:04:44.820> when

I'm<00:04:45.090> placing<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:45.780> I'll<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.640> supports<00:04:47.640> the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
I'm placing it I'll just supports the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.320 
I'm placing it I'll just supports the
the<00:04:48.360> flap<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.930> pocket<00:04:49.800> from<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.950> back<00:04:50.330> now
