 but you might not expect it 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.170

 both on the field and outside yes yes 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.449
 certainly 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.760
 as you hear the boys are 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.589
 fully agree with each other on the talents 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.670
 by the way, don't sleep in it's whole 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.010
 many apartment 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.690
 i hit with steffano and how yucca 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.920
 is that a bit quiet guys yes 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.409
 are also uneasy 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.299
 I sleep with the stefano and you 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.700
 carry has it goes the biggest 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.320
 room but it works very well 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 no slightly smaller room below 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.979
 yes i had no choice 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.600
 yo kay again the most experience so that 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.799
 panel lay there but then it must 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.299
 you accept him 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.549
 I've won and what we suppress the 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.649
 room are daily yes I am with bilal 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.119
 was tico below and I manage is good 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.640
 That 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.869
 that smooth by that there is so bit 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.469
 make jokes and menorah dies more of it 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.000
 the dry jokes so I can handle myself 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.250
 imagine how day work out but what 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.090
 do you yourself 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.189
 yes tables in our room quiet especially 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.770
 and sometimes the daily room does come sometimes 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.880
 also afterwards that pressures become restless and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.619
 restless 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.780
 but that sometimes would like to pass both 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.070
 Right Hook Bait Daley Sink Tombs 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.659
 in the second exhibition game against 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.310
 bee life cruising 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.469
 you must do parentheses directly opposite 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.649
 Stefan Kiessling who last season 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.329
 25 goals in the Bundesliga made 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.729
 yes that is nice against such 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.519
 split stand and see if it is already there and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.660
 what you still have to learn and how 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.960
 I have experienced I do 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.930
 yes yes it was mostly 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.640
 I found conditional pieces and it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.930
 was just very smart striker you on 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.210
 the right moment 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.070
 Tried to walk away and wash a few times 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.840
 it is therefore lucky because daley sink digging 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.170
 still against a lion's race and full on the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.000
 bin 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.280
 he is we should midfield opposite 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.600
 the german international stream rose and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.050
 lars bender 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.850
 yes of course wait experience but can 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.290
 you yourself a little we measure states with 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.270
 buzz municipality and we measure now look 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.100
 on back then 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.990
 yes but for me how did it go 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.870
 reasonable and 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.310
 but i did what i could guess what 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 that my ex over to then if you then it 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.670
 field is about well this is another 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.260
 opponent then in the a1 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.940
 normally study of nature yes 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.800
 No fear not watch you go along than 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.020
 contest and of course you know who 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.340
 and then and then play your match 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.040
 just put one in the app to the match 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.690
 you do not then you do not think to post 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.580
 you just play soccer game and the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.980
 opponent james league level yes 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.960
 Normally see it on TV and you 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.540
 stuff against 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.120
 nice experience yes the week and half 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.320
 how do you not look back anyway 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.300
 are you satisfied 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.760
 yes i think so I say we on fabric 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.200
 satisfied with how things are going now 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.200
 race times do come 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.370
 better but i think so far 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.660
 does go pretty well actually for me 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.520
 the training camp has been known for years 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.780
 as the moment for young talents to 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 to prove themselves 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.410
 players will adorn mainspring went 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.989
 but these guys also have one 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.690
 clear objective 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.820
 You do have a plan in mind and 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.680
 we want to work and it would be nice 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.959
 if you sas I come to the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.790
 first selection could come 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.440
 but that of course is also waiting 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.330
 maybe happened on the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.830
 transfer period 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.940
 but i hope and you much more often at the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.940
 Connecting first selection 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.890
 yes, of course, I hope so too 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.109
 bit of luck what so what 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.690
 it concerns or suspension but yes just 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.840
 as quickly as possible always before 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.370

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.419
 is like and may maybe so who 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.190
 know that is an opportunity through yes who knows 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.970
