probably<00:00:15.450> pistons<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.630> liners<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.970> truck

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
probably pistons and liners and truck

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.779 
probably pistons and liners and truck
number<00:00:19.539> 73<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:22.119> been<00:00:23.550> having<00:00:24.550> some

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
number 73 it's been having some

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.499 
number 73 it's been having some
tremendous<00:00:25.300> blow<00:00:25.539> buy<00:00:25.720> for<00:00:26.109> about<00:00:26.199> a<00:00:26.380> year<00:00:26.679> now

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
tremendous blow buy for about a year now

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.140 
tremendous blow buy for about a year now
hadn't<00:00:28.509> really<00:00:28.689> used<00:00:28.929> any<00:00:29.230> oil<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.679> just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
hadn't really used any oil it just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.640 
hadn't really used any oil it just
steaming<00:00:31.150> out<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.539> draft<00:00:31.810> tube<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.349> so<00:00:32.619> I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
steaming out the draft tube and so I

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.820 
steaming out the draft tube and so I
bought<00:00:32.949> a<00:00:33.010> rebuild<00:00:33.610> kit<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.470> I<00:00:35.470> said<00:00:35.650> well

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
bought a rebuild kit and I said well

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.380 
bought a rebuild kit and I said well
I'll<00:00:36.040> I'll<00:00:36.370> run<00:00:36.699> it<00:00:36.820> till<00:00:36.970> it<00:00:37.059> gets<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.330> little

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
I'll I'll run it till it gets a little

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.490 
I'll I'll run it till it gets a little
worse<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:38.519> he<00:00:39.519> had<00:00:39.610> um<00:00:40.320> started<00:00:41.320> dropping

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
worse and he had um started dropping

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.250 
worse and he had um started dropping
water<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:44.199> cool<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:46.260> started

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
water in the in the cool no started

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.579 
water in the in the cool no started
dropping<00:00:47.409> coolant<00:00:47.890> in<00:00:47.979> the<00:00:48.010> oil<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.420> I<00:00:49.750> figured

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
dropping coolant in the oil so I figured

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.250 
dropping coolant in the oil so I figured
it<00:00:50.710> was<00:00:50.799> time<00:00:50.979> to<00:00:51.040> go<00:00:51.280> ahead<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:52.019> rebuild<00:00:53.019> it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
it was time to go ahead and rebuild it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.700 
it was time to go ahead and rebuild it
and<00:00:53.409> I<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.530> went<00:00:54.010> ahead<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.460> had<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.729> em<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.559> if

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
and I I went ahead and I had a em and if

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.520 
and I I went ahead and I had a em and if
the<00:00:56.739> old<00:00:56.949> cylinder<00:00:57.430> head<00:00:58.229> I've<00:00:59.229> got<00:00:59.500> um<00:00:59.769> I<00:01:01.530> went

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
the old cylinder head I've got um I went

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.410 
the old cylinder head I've got um I went
ahead<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:02.920> had<00:01:03.070> I<00:01:03.460> got<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.640> spare<00:01:03.909> head<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.390> I

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
ahead and had I got a spare head so I

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.370 
ahead and had I got a spare head so I
had<00:01:04.659> it<00:01:04.689> rebuilt<00:01:05.409> new<00:01:05.860> valves<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.869> guides<00:01:07.869> and

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
had it rebuilt new valves and guides and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.490 
had it rebuilt new valves and guides and
seats<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.359> all<00:01:10.359> that<00:01:10.689> right<00:01:11.020> there<00:01:11.049> look<00:01:11.409> at

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
seats and all that right there look at

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.459 
seats and all that right there look at
the<00:01:11.590> dust<00:01:11.829> on<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.100> packaging<00:01:12.929> so<00:01:13.929> um<00:01:14.229> I

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
the dust on the packaging so um I

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.169 
the dust on the packaging so um I
shouldn't<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.280> wait<00:01:15.429> on<00:01:15.609> anything<00:01:16.030> off

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
shouldn't have to wait on anything off

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.120 
shouldn't have to wait on anything off
it<00:01:16.329> should<00:01:16.509> just<00:01:17.100> pull<00:01:18.100> snatch<00:01:18.670> liners<00:01:19.149> out

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it should just pull snatch liners out

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.950 
it should just pull snatch liners out
the<00:01:21.130> new<00:01:21.249> packings<00:01:21.759> new<00:01:21.969> liners<00:01:22.390> put<00:01:22.719> it<00:01:22.810> back

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
the new packings new liners put it back

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.489 
the new packings new liners put it back
in<00:01:23.170> roll<00:01:23.439> in<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.710> set<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.009> mains<00:01:24.249> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:26.200> start

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
in roll in a set of mains and then start

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.760 
in roll in a set of mains and then start
loading<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.920> Pistons<00:01:27.340> back<00:01:27.549> in<00:01:27.789> there<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
loading the Pistons back in there and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.719 
loading the Pistons back in there and
then<00:01:30.030> put<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.119> pan<00:01:31.299> back<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.520> new

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
then put the pan back on and put the new

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
then put the pan back on and put the new
head<00:01:33.939> on<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:34.890> torque<00:01:35.890> her<00:01:36.039> down<00:01:36.219> and<00:01:36.460> put

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
head on it and torque her down and put

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.789 
head on it and torque her down and put
all<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.409> rest<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.710> stuff<00:01:38.920> back<00:01:39.130> on<00:01:39.369> there<00:01:39.609> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
all the rest of stuff back on there and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.929 
all the rest of stuff back on there and
we<00:01:41.799> won't<00:01:42.009> be<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:44.020> won't<00:01:44.170> be<00:01:44.640> steaming<00:01:45.640> down

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
we won't be we won't be steaming down

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.039 
we won't be we won't be steaming down
the<00:01:46.090> road<00:01:46.240> any<00:01:46.479> longer

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
the road any longer

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.469 
the road any longer
I<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.399> little<00:01:48.549> antifreeze<00:01:49.060> right<00:01:49.270> there

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
I see you little antifreeze right there

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.859 
I see you little antifreeze right there
so<00:01:49.719> I'm<00:01:49.840> thinking<00:01:50.200> liner<00:01:50.409> packings<00:01:50.889> went<00:01:51.869> on

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
so I'm thinking liner packings went on

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.320 
so I'm thinking liner packings went on
number<00:01:53.520> four

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
number four

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.550 
number four
or<00:01:56.720> maybe<00:01:57.440> erosion<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.960> don't<00:01:59.960> know<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:00.530> just

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
or maybe erosion I don't know we just

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.430 
or maybe erosion I don't know we just
have<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.980> see<00:02:01.480> we're<00:02:02.480> a<00:02:02.510> little<00:02:02.660> piston<00:02:03.320> out

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
have to see we're a little piston out

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.920 
have to see we're a little piston out
we'll<00:02:03.620> find<00:02:03.920> out<00:02:04.070> what<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.310> update<00:02:04.580> is<00:02:04.930> well

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
we'll find out what the update is well

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.670 
we'll find out what the update is well
not<00:02:06.110> what<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.380> expected<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.280> see<00:02:08.440> piston<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:09.560> in

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
not what I expected to see piston all in

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.280 
not what I expected to see piston all in
all<00:02:09.830> looks<00:02:10.040> pretty<00:02:10.369> good<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:11.140> thought<00:02:12.140> I'd

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
all looks pretty good I thought I'd

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.270 
all looks pretty good I thought I'd
probably<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.770> some<00:02:12.980> broke<00:02:13.370> rings<00:02:13.640> are<00:02:13.850> stuck

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
probably see some broke rings are stuck

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.950 
probably see some broke rings are stuck
but<00:02:16.280> there's<00:02:16.520> talk<00:02:17.240> compression<00:02:17.780> rings

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
but there's talk compression rings

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.950 
but there's talk compression rings
broken<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.570> second

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
broken and so is the so is the second

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.920 
broken and so is the so is the second
ring<00:02:24.080> broken

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
ring broken

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.980 
ring broken
and<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.080> be<00:02:27.200> honest<00:02:27.530> through<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.780> I'm<00:02:29.780> not

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
and to be honest through you I'm not

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.440 
and to be honest through you I'm not
sure<00:02:30.320> what<00:02:31.010> caused<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.760> know<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.000> had<00:02:32.300> an

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
sure what caused this I know I had an

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.820 
sure what caused this I know I had an
injector<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.050> was<00:02:33.140> hitting<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.410> little<00:02:33.530> hard

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
injector that was hitting a little hard

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.470 
injector that was hitting a little hard
I<00:02:36.190> don't<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.460> that's<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:37.940> happened<00:02:38.120> I

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
I don't think that's what happened I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.340 
I don't think that's what happened I
don't<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.480> anyway<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.930> old<00:02:42.050> rings

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
don't know but anyway the old rings

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.060 
don't know but anyway the old rings
still<00:02:42.560> intact<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.830> mean<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:45.920> weren't

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
still intact so I mean you weren't

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.990 
still intact so I mean you weren't
burning<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.520> hole

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
burning the hole

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.730 
burning the hole
you<00:02:47.720> might<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:47.960> been<00:02:48.080> pushing<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.440> little<00:02:48.650> bit

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
you might have been pushing a little bit

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.530 
you might have been pushing a little bit
out<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.070> draft<00:02:49.310> tube<00:02:49.610> but<00:02:51.730> anyway<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.970> really

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
out the draft tube but anyway I really

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.270 
out the draft tube but anyway I really
expected<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.080> see<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.410> top<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.860> piston

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
expected to see the top of that piston

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.210 
expected to see the top of that piston
all<00:02:55.400> laid<00:02:55.610> up<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.960> expected<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.560> see<00:02:57.890> I

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
all laid up and I expected to see I

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.320 
all laid up and I expected to see I
expected<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> see<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.550> ring<00:03:01.700> stuck<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.180> here

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
expected to see the ring stuck in here

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.360 
expected to see the ring stuck in here
but<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:02.630> broken<00:03:03.520> but<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.190> shows<00:03:07.340> you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
but not broken but it just shows you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.990 
but not broken but it just shows you
what<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.730> know

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
what I know

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.790 
what I know
nothing<00:03:11.740> all<00:03:12.740> right<00:03:13.010> well<00:03:13.340> I'm<00:03:13.640> gonna

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
nothing all right well I'm gonna

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.440 
nothing all right well I'm gonna
continue<00:03:15.800> all<00:03:17.740> afternoon<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.450> engine

continue all afternoon to the engine

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.070 
continue all afternoon to the engine
rebuild<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:22.120> got<00:03:23.120> some<00:03:23.330> parts<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.720> here<00:03:23.870> gonna

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
rebuild I got some parts in here gonna

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.690 
rebuild I got some parts in here gonna
clean<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.530> rocker<00:03:24.770> arms<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.370> stuff<00:03:25.550> like

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
clean it up rocker arms and stuff like

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.740 
clean it up rocker arms and stuff like
that<00:03:25.940> part<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.580> got<00:03:28.580> my<00:03:28.730> main<00:03:28.970> bearings<00:03:29.420> rolled

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
that part I got my main bearings rolled

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.160 
that part I got my main bearings rolled
in<00:03:30.020> I<00:03:30.260> got<00:03:30.590> my<00:03:30.620> new<00:03:30.830> liners<00:03:31.250> put<00:03:31.489> in<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:35.170> had

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
in I got my new liners put in and had

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.490 
in I got my new liners put in and had
two<00:03:36.350> broken<00:03:36.590> rings<00:03:36.920> on<00:03:37.160> number<00:03:37.520> six<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.500> then

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
two broken rings on number six and then

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.770 
two broken rings on number six and then
that<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.220> heat<00:03:40.400> going<00:03:40.760> past<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> piston<00:03:43.780> burn

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
that the heat going past the piston burn

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.330 
that the heat going past the piston burn
through<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.140> liner<00:03:45.350> packing<00:03:45.830> right<00:03:45.980> here<00:03:46.220> and

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
through the liner packing right here and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.130 
through the liner packing right here and
it<00:03:46.400> made<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.700> brittle<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.840> started

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
it made it brittle and it started

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.710 
it made it brittle and it started
dropping<00:03:48.320> water<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:51.310> crankcase<00:03:52.720> actually

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
dropping water in the crankcase actually

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.650 
dropping water in the crankcase actually
steam<00:03:54.080> really<00:03:54.500> not<00:03:54.650> much<00:03:54.800> water<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.340> steam

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
steam really not much water just steam

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.430 
steam really not much water just steam
but<00:03:56.660> anyway<00:03:57.020> got<00:03:57.380> new<00:03:58.250> mains<00:03:58.520> rolled<00:03:58.850> in<00:03:59.030> here

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
but anyway got new mains rolled in here

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.120 
but anyway got new mains rolled in here
haven't<00:04:00.440> got<00:04:00.530> them<00:04:00.650> torqued<00:04:00.980> yet<00:04:03.040> but<00:04:04.040> I've

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
haven't got them torqued yet but I've

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.229 
haven't got them torqued yet but I've
got<00:04:04.160> them<00:04:04.400> snugged<00:04:04.670> up<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.760> my<00:04:08.030> last

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
got them snugged up and this is my last

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.450 
got them snugged up and this is my last
piston

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
piston

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.190 
piston
I<00:04:10.520> went<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.540> full<00:04:11.960> ring<00:04:12.260> piston<00:04:13.870> DTS<00:04:14.870> come

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
I went to a full ring piston DTS come

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.980 
I went to a full ring piston DTS come
with<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:16.900> with<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> three<00:04:18.200> ring<00:04:18.380> piston<00:04:18.860> and<00:04:19.990> they

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:20.990 
with a with a three ring piston and they

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.810 
with a with a three ring piston and they
don't<00:04:21.170> have<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.410> whole<00:04:21.620> lot<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.920> longevity<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.730> a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
don't have a whole lot of longevity in a

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.610 
don't have a whole lot of longevity in a
heavy<00:04:23.000> truck<00:04:23.240> like<00:04:23.480> this<00:04:23.720> about<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.350> hundred

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
heavy truck like this about a hundred

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.950 
heavy truck like this about a hundred
thousand<00:04:24.950> miles<00:04:25.070> maybe<00:04:25.310> 150<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.060> all<00:04:26.270> I've

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
thousand miles maybe 150 is all I've

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.680 
thousand miles maybe 150 is all I've
been<00:04:27.260> able<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.530> get<00:04:27.650> out<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:27.800> them<00:04:28.300> I'm<00:04:29.300> hoping

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
been able to get out of them I'm hoping

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.540 
been able to get out of them I'm hoping
that<00:04:29.900> by<00:04:30.080> going<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.590> full<00:04:30.860> ring<00:04:31.070> piston

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
that by going to this full ring piston

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.340 
that by going to this full ring piston
that<00:04:32.090> might<00:04:32.660> give<00:04:32.840> me<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.020> little<00:04:33.170> more

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
that might give me a little more

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.730 
that might give me a little more
longevity<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.490> overdrive<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
longevity and the overdrive in the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.060 
longevity and the overdrive in the
transmission<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.040> project<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.580> we<00:04:37.730> did<00:04:39.070> but

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
transmission the project that we did but

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.260 
transmission the project that we did but
anyway<00:04:40.400> we've<00:04:41.330> got<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.110> last<00:04:43.270> last

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
anyway we've got this is the last last

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.880 
anyway we've got this is the last last
piston<00:04:44.810> put<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.860> rings<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.510> now<00:04:47.710> one<00:04:48.710> day

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
piston put the rings on it now one day

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:58.570 
piston put the rings on it now one day
I'll<00:04:49.040> take<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:50.710> go<00:04:51.710> ahead<00:04:54.430> go<00:04:55.430> ahead<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:57.580> get

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
I'll take it go ahead go ahead and get

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.180 
I'll take it go ahead go ahead and get
my<00:04:59.620> ring<00:05:00.620> squeezer<00:05:00.980> and<00:05:02.320> torque<00:05:03.320> them<00:05:03.500> mains

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
my ring squeezer and torque them mains

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.500 
my ring squeezer and torque them mains
and<00:05:05.800> start<00:05:06.800> loading<00:05:07.250> these<00:05:07.550> Pistons<00:05:08.090> in<00:05:08.300> there

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
and start loading these Pistons in there

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.330 
and start loading these Pistons in there
and<00:05:09.050> get<00:05:09.200> them<00:05:09.350> loaded<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:09.890> get<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.130> rods

torqued<00:05:10.760> down<00:05:10.820> on<00:05:11.120> them<00:05:11.560> then<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.680> can<00:05:12.830> put<00:05:13.010> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
torqued down on them then I can put the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
torqued down on them then I can put the
pan<00:05:13.310> back<00:05:13.340> on<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:15.490> then<00:05:16.490> it's<00:05:16.640> time<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:16.970> put

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120
