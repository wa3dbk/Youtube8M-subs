2601<00:00:24.480> which<00:00:25.170> talks<00:00:25.470> about<00:00:25.560> understanding

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
2601 which talks about understanding

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
2601 which talks about understanding
those<00:00:26.580> fundamental<00:00:27.359> principles<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.170> we'll

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
those fundamental principles so we'll

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
those fundamental principles so we'll
need<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.800> able<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> socket

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
need to be able to look at the socket

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
need to be able to look at the socket
that's<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> motherboard<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> CPU<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that's on a motherboard for the CPU and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720 
that's on a motherboard for the CPU and
understand<00:00:33.630> more<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.040> what<00:00:35.040> type<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> cpu

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
understand more about what type of cpu

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
understand more about what type of cpu
goes<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.719> type<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> socket<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
goes in there what type of socket it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
goes in there what type of socket it
might<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.219> those<00:00:38.370> two<00:00:38.640> things<00:00:38.879> are

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
might be and how those two things are

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
might be and how those two things are
associated<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:39.930> each<00:00:40.140> other<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.980> we're

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
associated with each other so we're

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
associated with each other so we're
going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:41.430> only<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.780> old-school

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
going to not only look at the old-school

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
going to not only look at the old-school
dip<00:00:43.800> type<00:00:44.100> sockets<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.000> those<00:00:45.120> really

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
dip type sockets and what those really

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
dip type sockets and what those really
consisted<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.770> we'll<00:00:46.920> show<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.579> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
consisted of but we'll show you some of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
consisted of but we'll show you some of
the<00:00:48.079> slot<00:00:49.079> sockets<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.010> which<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.340> even

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the slot sockets some of which are even

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.880 
the slot sockets some of which are even
still<00:00:50.820> used<00:00:51.090> today<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.020> mostly<00:00:52.350> we're<00:00:52.739> using

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
still used today but mostly we're using

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.100 
still used today but mostly we're using
PGA<00:00:53.430> sockets<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.239> we'll<00:00:54.390> certainly<00:00:54.629> spend

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
PGA sockets so we'll certainly spend

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
PGA sockets so we'll certainly spend
some<00:00:55.289> time<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.710> those<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> socket<00:00:57.570> types

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
some time on those the socket types

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.139 
some time on those the socket types
themselves<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.800> go<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.309> back<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.730> we'll<00:01:00.030> look

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
themselves we go way back and we'll look

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
themselves we go way back and we'll look
at<00:01:00.300> some<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> very<00:01:00.899> first<00:01:01.170> personal

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
at some of the very first personal

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
at some of the very first personal
computers<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.489> were<00:01:02.640> ever<00:01:02.789> created<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.930> can

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
computers that were ever created we can

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.580 
computers that were ever created we can
see<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> Intel<00:01:05.280> 8088<00:01:06.060> processor<00:01:07.049> was

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
see that the Intel 8088 processor was

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
see that the Intel 8088 processor was
what<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.950> called<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.460> dual<00:01:08.790> inline<00:01:09.479> package<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
what we called a dual inline package and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.340 
what we called a dual inline package and
that's<00:01:10.560> because<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.400> had<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.210> sets<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.869> pins

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that's because it had two sets of pins

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.370 
that's because it had two sets of pins
across<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.400> when<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> wanted<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.750> install

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
across it and when you wanted to install

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
across it and when you wanted to install
one<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.860> processors<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
one of these processors you you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.270 
one of these processors you you
essentially<00:01:19.470> put<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> motherboard

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
essentially put it on the motherboard

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
essentially put it on the motherboard
and<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> lined<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and you lined it up with what was on the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.289 
and you lined it up with what was on the
motherboard<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> picture<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> what

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
motherboard I think of a picture of what

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
motherboard I think of a picture of what
one<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.810> sockets<00:01:25.080> look<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
one of those sockets look like this is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.859 
one of those sockets look like this is
the<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> socket<00:01:27.210> looks<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the way the socket looks on the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.600 
the way the socket looks on the
motherboard<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.799> comes<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.189> an

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
motherboard this actually comes from an

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.120 
motherboard this actually comes from an
old<00:01:29.729> token<00:01:30.210> ring<00:01:30.360> card<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.259> uses<00:01:31.530> those

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
old token ring card that uses those

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
old token ring card that uses those
types<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.640> chips<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> well<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> had<00:01:34.200> align

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
types of chips as well so you had align

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.550 
types of chips as well so you had align
the<00:01:34.770> chip<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.220> exactly<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:37.200> push

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the chip up exactly right and then push

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
the chip up exactly right and then push
very<00:01:38.070> carefully<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.329> chip<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.840> down

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
very carefully have that chip go down

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
very carefully have that chip go down
into<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:41.070> mother<00:01:41.310> border<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
into that that mother border into that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.120 
into that that mother border into that
circuit<00:01:42.630> board<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.590> problem<00:01:43.950> was<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
circuit board and the problem was that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.969 
circuit board and the problem was that
if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.490> were<00:01:44.670> off<00:01:44.909> by<00:01:45.270> even<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
if you were off by even a little bit the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.920 
if you were off by even a little bit the
pin<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.490> Bend<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:47.970> hopefully<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> were

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
pin would Bend up hopefully you were

we<00:03:37.349> call<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.650> zero<00:03:38.040> insertion<00:03:38.669> force<00:03:40.189> sockets

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
we call the zero insertion force sockets

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.830 
we call the zero insertion force sockets

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.560 
fortunately these days the sockets and
the<00:05:25.710> number<00:05:25.980> of<00:05:26.100> pins<00:05:26.340> have<00:05:26.910> exactly<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.510> same

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
the number of pins have exactly the same

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.220 
the number of pins have exactly the same
name<00:05:27.990> so<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.320> socket<00:05:28.770> 370<00:05:29.370> it's<00:05:29.850> got<00:05:30.020> 370<00:05:31.020> pins

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
name so a socket 370 it's got 370 pins

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.420 
name so a socket 370 it's got 370 pins
on<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.740> socket<00:05:32.370> 478<00:05:32.940> has<00:05:33.800> 478<00:05:34.800> pins<00:05:35.070> on<00:05:35.280> it

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
on it a socket 478 has 478 pins on it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.340 
on it a socket 478 has 478 pins on it
much<00:05:35.820> easier<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.480> understand<00:05:37.080> in<00:05:37.230> those

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
much easier to understand in those

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.680 
much easier to understand in those
scenarios<00:05:37.620> but<00:05:38.520> there<00:05:38.700> are<00:05:38.880> some<00:05:39.120> relatively

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
scenarios but there are some relatively

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.890 
scenarios but there are some relatively
new<00:05:40.190> CPUs<00:05:41.190> that<00:05:41.820> don't<00:05:42.090> use<00:05:42.300> sockets<00:05:42.720> like

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
new CPUs that don't use sockets like

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.990 
new CPUs that don't use sockets like
that<00:05:43.080> they<00:05:43.320> continue<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.950> use<00:05:44.040> slots<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.910> in

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
that they continue to use slots and in

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.150 
that they continue to use slots and in
that<00:05:45.120> case<00:05:45.360> like<00:05:45.600> a<00:05:45.630> slot<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.170> for<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.740> AMD

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
that case like a slot a for the AMD

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.240 
that case like a slot a for the AMD
athlon<00:05:47.640> it's<00:05:47.970> one<00:05:48.510> that<00:05:48.690> has<00:05:48.810> 242<00:05:49.710> pins<00:05:49.980> and

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
athlon it's one that has 242 pins and

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.160

Pentium<00:05:54.540> to<00:05:54.810> so<00:05:55.800> on<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.100> exam<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.520> may<00:05:56.670> be

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
Pentium to so on the exam you may be

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.130 
Pentium to so on the exam you may be
asked<00:05:57.180> for<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.390> number<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.780> these<00:05:57.930> different

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
pieces this is one of those those tasks

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.420 
pieces this is one of those those tasks
where<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:00.990> just<00:06:01.230> need<00:06:01.410> to<00:06:01.560> memorize<00:06:01.950> the

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
where you just need to memorize the

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.040 
where you just need to memorize the
number<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.850> pins<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.420> the<00:06:03.480> different<00:06:03.810> types

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
number of pins and the different types

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.050 
number of pins and the different types
of<00:06:04.230> sockets<00:06:04.680> probably<00:06:05.340> not<00:06:05.490> for<00:06:05.640> every

possibility of sockets these are the
most<00:06:07.860> popular<00:06:08.100> ones<00:06:08.550> that<00:06:08.820> you'll<00:06:08.970> probably

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
most popular ones that you'll probably

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.420 
most popular ones that you'll probably
see<00:06:09.660> on<00:06:09.780> an<00:06:09.900> exam<00:06:10.260> but<00:06:10.740> it's<00:06:10.890> nice<00:06:11.100> to<00:06:11.280> have

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
see on an exam but it's nice to have

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.130 
see on an exam but it's nice to have
that<00:06:11.640> nomenclature<00:06:11.960> available<00:06:12.960> and

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
that nomenclature available and

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.140 
that nomenclature available and
