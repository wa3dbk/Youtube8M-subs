00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
like that okay on this one I have two

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.119 
like that okay on this one I have two
lines<00:03:25.730> drawn<00:03:26.060> with<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.390> color<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:27.950> I'm

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
lines drawn with that color and then I'm

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.210 
lines drawn with that color and then I'm
just<00:03:28.159> gonna<00:03:28.400> go<00:03:28.700> through<00:03:32.680> with<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:33.890> little

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
just gonna go through with just little

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.860 
just gonna go through with just little
tiny<00:03:36.010> lines<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:38.239> here<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.629> have<00:03:38.750> to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
tiny lines and this here you have to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.509 
tiny lines and this here you have to
make<00:03:38.989> your<00:03:39.110> your<00:03:39.860> paint<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.159> little<00:03:40.310> bit

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
make your your paint a little bit

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.970 
make your your paint a little bit
thicker<00:03:40.879> actually<00:03:41.569> I<00:03:41.810> can't<00:03:42.349> use<00:03:42.500> real<00:03:42.650> thin

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
thicker actually I can't use real thin

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.789 
thicker actually I can't use real thin
because<00:03:43.159> the<00:03:43.400> lines<00:03:43.579> are<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.090> tiny<00:03:44.799> there's

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
because the lines are so tiny there's

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.500 
because the lines are so tiny there's
that<00:03:46.129> and<00:03:46.760> then<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.209> will<00:03:47.269> go<00:03:47.540> over<00:03:49.060> with<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.120> few

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that and then I will go over with a few

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.530 
that and then I will go over with a few
dots<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:52.519> enough<00:03:52.849> to<00:03:52.970> add<00:03:53.000> them<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.390> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
dots just enough to add them to the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.420 
dots just enough to add them to the
design<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.140> not<00:03:54.319> define<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.129> design

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
design but not define the design

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.940 
design but not define the design
themselves<00:03:56.299> okay<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.349> would<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.650> that

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
themselves okay so it would be like that

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.330 
themselves okay so it would be like that
let<00:03:58.579> me<00:03:58.609> let<00:03:59.000> me<00:03:59.030> scope<00:03:59.329> back<00:03:59.629> a<00:03:59.659> little<00:03:59.959> bit

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
let me let me scope back a little bit

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.759 
let me let me scope back a little bit
and<00:04:01.340> show<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:02.180> did<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.079> same<00:04:03.319> thing<00:04:03.590> on

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
and show you I did the same thing on

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.770 
and show you I did the same thing on
this<00:04:04.489> one<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.879> then<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.030> changed<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.510> up<00:04:05.599> and

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
this one and then I changed it up and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.660 
this one and then I changed it up and
put<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> flower<00:04:06.200> on<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.680> second<00:04:07.040> one<00:04:07.190> but

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
put a flower on the second one but

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.309 
put a flower on the second one but
basically<00:04:07.819> it's<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.420> same<00:04:08.599> design<00:04:08.930> on<00:04:08.959> both

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
basically it's the same design on both
