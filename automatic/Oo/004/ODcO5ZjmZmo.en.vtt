00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 Audi is expanding the range of its models 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.990
 continue and bring the s7 sportback 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.240
 to the market thanks to adaptive 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.760
 air suspension is the body at 20 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.400
 millimeters lower than the normal a7 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.560
 and makes the rs 7 sporty though 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.939
 nevertheless the limit of the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.099
 can speed up 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.550
 customer request is canceled and is 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.699
 then up to 305 km h if you are here 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.010
 on the accelerator pedal that presses one 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.690
 already quite in the seat 412 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.120
 kilowatt power 560 hp 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.160
 there is already a thrust forward 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.930
 Tachometer up to 8000 revolutions per 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.539
 minute a speedometer to 320 km h and one 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.820
 engine of 4 liters and eight cylinders 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.559
 700 Nm of torque is generated here 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.559
 slumbers a true power plant 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.800
 we have lightweight construction technology in it 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.140
 We have latest engine technology with 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.940
 goal in rom demand in it that is at 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.860
 quiet driving we drive partially 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.270
 in four-cylinder operation without them 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.560
 the driver with but in the war 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.610
 of course you already feel it 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.409
 be downsizing significantly thanks for that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 newly developed engine replaces one 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.180
 so far in other rs models 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 used more power at v10 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.560
 less consumption means for the rs 7 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.990
 a super plus the average 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.990
 needs 9 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 stopped not kicked of course 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.259
 for fast gear changes provides a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.750
 eight-speed tiptronic automatic good 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.689
 All in all, the s7 is of course one 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.330
 car with an incredible amount of power though 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.009
 It also costs an incredible amount of money 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.009
 have the times calculated roughly 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.640
 roll over about 113,000 euro is 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.810
 the base price of the rs 7 and with the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.340
 all the extra one is on 150000 euro 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.410
 A bargain is the sporty 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.209
 truly elegant in gold cities 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.100
 but one thing is certain 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.860
 the power that promises to be outside 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.440
 he also delivers reliably 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.569
 despite being dull, the rs 7 is a type 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.880
 Its shine also on the driver 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.910
 transfers for people with corresponding 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.910
 purse a ego strings so to speak 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.450
 the tail reveals the two faces 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.150
 the sports sedan sportsmanship with 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.920
 extendable spoiler and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.510
 fitness for everyday use with one 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 family-friendly trunk 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.670
 the design of the car on this this 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.590
 coupÃ©-like design speaks as well 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.660
 especially our clientele in the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.240
 USA and China have that's where 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.250
 we may not be like that with the rs6 yet 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.980
 meet the taste because an avant 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.020
 not the taste in the usa meets there 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.959
 he will be seven in any case 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.940
 reach the right audience 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.700
 in the interior audi leaves nothing to the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.650
 chance in comparison to the normal a7 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.180
 small details make the difference 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.239
 like the numerous ones 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.269
 Lettering on fittings 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.269
 and floor mats 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.220
 unfortunately not in the price list 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.530
 is somehow contained an option package 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.620
 that you do not care about that 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.400
 keep speed limits 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.860
 must because the field with the rs 7 extremely 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.990
 Hard if 70 is really too 70 too 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.030
 drive 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.250
 My conclusion of the s7 it for everyday life 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.130
 actually completely overpowered but 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.290
 it's fun and if you just 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.860
 this dynamic would like to have this between 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.680
 travel sedan very dignified 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.600
 glide along and sometimes pretty fast 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.150
 to make the turn 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.150
 the audi s7 will certainly like that
