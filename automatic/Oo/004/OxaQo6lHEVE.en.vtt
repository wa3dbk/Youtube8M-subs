 real problems of these games the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.840
 inconsistencies 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.100
 if the reason me first I noticed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.129

 also the brave radio cd rims 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 hagen know what I do not settle for 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.379
 of a single game to show his pump to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 watch this on some next-gen games 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.920
 let's talk about fps 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.719
 with of duty ghost the slips made 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.430
 part of novelties it was top 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.719
 to see like that with earth throw 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.980
 stuff like that while we slide 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.719
 frankly it's too classy is too much 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 well done frankly there's nothing that you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.970
 shock and nothing at all absolutely nothing 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.470
 a slip on the earth ok you have to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
 the land that fly is normal slip 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.409
 is on concrete only to the earth that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.760
 fly ok maybe we did a 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.900
 little bit about shoes at the moment 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.250
 you arrived it's not serious it's 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.720
 normal but from the land they want 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.259
 then you are in a factory from the beginning 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.350
 until the end 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.659
 it's not normal especially cooking the bottom 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.830
 low and metal or 20th are said on 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.150
 will put the earth all the time they 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.150
 are not going to see it and ben me I bus 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.290
 in the campaign mode now in the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.880
 last mission or are we Turkish 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.930
 well yeah I have this pole but all the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.580
 world does not care anyway where all the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 world has already finished short we come to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 stop the bad guy from a bullet in the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.090
 heart even if we target the meats bart 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.680
 buysse and will go as in the case so 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.330
 after stumbling we save our brother 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 saves our skin also by avoiding the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.930
 drowning it's great we lie down on the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.150
 beach and it is believed that the game is over 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 after the villain comes back shocks us 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.160
 minutes reindeer 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 so here there are several questions that 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.790
 are already wondering how the guy was able 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.380
 survive a bullet in the heart in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.759
 general so we die yes it's for 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.680
 tell you if it hurts enough then in 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.210
 the more we managed to dodge the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.500
 drowning but the guy and he managed to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.300
 stay in the water for super 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.800
 long after he said to himself I go 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.850
 am going to make a little surprise I 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.110
 I'm dying but it's not 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.360
 serious I 'm going all the way around this 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.050
 man is amazing now let's move on 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.780
 a zelda the wind waker today 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.340
 it's a je-ne-sais-quoi game is out 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.440
 on wii or so it's a next-gen game 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.820
 and this beautiful game is he he has 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 also some small inconsistencies 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.090
 actually at the beginning of the adventures in 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.320
 zelda you to us at heart at one time he 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.910
 there are pirates coming from 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.900
 gun firing on a giant eagle is there 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.760
 there is a girl who falls in the middle 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.959
 of the forest and there we say we go 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.980
 will go but before going will ask the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.269
 passersby what they in France a little 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.220
 almost everyone seems a little 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.989
 little crazy except this guy with his beautiful 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.280
 lawn but say so I wonder 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.019
 what's going on in this forest 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.880
 his cannon shots but what can he do well 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.440
 happen and 10 months rather than 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.700
 to try said lucid and this mystery and in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 doing a little bit of shit that would tell you 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.370
 of medea time of the lawn with your 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.810
 sword or if not even better at the moment of 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.519
 go with the pirates to go 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.019
 look for our sister we go back to see what 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.090
 guy is here he tells us the same thing 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.560
 to slats as her who's gone that's 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.120
 really a phew thing I'm really 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.590
 sorry for you your luck for the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.090
 find and my ten months before I go 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.980
 regain his tithe help cut the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.870
 lawn with your ep this guy is a big 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 con now a little catane ex you 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.959
 go see it's very funny if if I 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.310
 assure you we see a girl waiting 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.750
 alone man but what are you doing 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.190
 so in the paint have all alone in the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.810
 night and basically she answers us I 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.760
 to annoy you do what you want 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.079
 now clears us then as to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.299
 make worthy of the name 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.160
 we decide to spy on him and share 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.730
 even we stumble stealing in a 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.220
 safe 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.220
 we we we will arrest him and month 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.810
 the little that you can and then we 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.790
 begins to discuss with them everything 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.139
 go well and if you answer wrong but 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.579
 you have to start all over again even if 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.139
 that's it I break it so we say to ourselves 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.160
 shit I missed an appendix quest and ben 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.270
 in fact no you have the right to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.190
 retry and there the girl 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.080
 when you see him ask you who 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.180
 so besides being a thief at 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.970
 the alzheimer down we met there is 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.730
 two minutes it really tells you nothing 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.050
 okay good evening frankly 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.060
 fifa 14th agrees it's a game of 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.820
 good football a game of football ok I tell you 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.040
 grant me I know I'm funny 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.600
 in my head the people they laughed good 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.580
 short in this game any way ever 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.070
 including arbitration system but when 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.690
 even I'm loupe there for example is not there 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.100
 fault while I think that in real life 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.010
 must be a little punish 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.300
 this kind because it hurts I am 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.709
 not sure it is very regulatory in 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.299
 same greece with regard to 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.530
 celebrations a trick I understand 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.690
 really not how is it possible in 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.870
 true finally good it's fun that's what 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.210
 account i steal michel game 20 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.620
 battlefield 4 a very interesting game to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.180
 a campaign mode anyway good I hope 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.130
 not spoiler I laugh I do not care 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.240
 another moment of the game we have our friends 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.380
 Vietnamese who burst 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.370
 well we could not be sad being 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.780
 given that we knew him so much 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.010
 quickly we do not care a bit 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.110
 and in the end we find it in the 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.910
 aircraft carrier last machine and he 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.590
 come help us 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.610
 that's already it's pretty vague but good 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.949
 you will tell me in the movies 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.060
 americans and goes on worse stuff 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.100
 so I'm going to say nothing but something that 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.729
 I really did not like it at all 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.740
 battlefield 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.199
 it's at the end offers you to make a 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.850
 choice between Chinese and black who 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.680
 is our friend is one of the two must be 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.770
 sacrifice for what are we not left 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.610
 a choice is where the player sacrifices himself 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.660
 to save both 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.130
 frankly it would have burned more 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.139
 class I think rather than send 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.729
 to worry about embarrassment to mine or 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.270
 to send to suicide a black friend 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.180
 we love 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.630
 now we've done the games 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.610
 next-gen 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.600
 we will play a little game in particular 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.590
 oh no no I'm stupid the video down 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.460
 she just finished 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.910
 fathers or too much asking the little had 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.910
 had brief
