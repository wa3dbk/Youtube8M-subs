everybody else to do to clay for rough
it's<00:00:56.420> always<00:00:56.690> easiest<00:00:57.020> without<00:00:57.770> Rafa<00:00:58.219> and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.860 
it's always easiest without Rafa and
Roger<00:00:58.520> I<00:00:58.699> think<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.120> our<00:00:59.270> score<00:00:59.600> would<00:00:59.809> be

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
Roger I think that our score would be

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.110 
Roger I think that our score would be
missing<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.440> lot<00:01:00.590> of<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.949> those<00:01:01.309> those<00:01:01.730> epic
