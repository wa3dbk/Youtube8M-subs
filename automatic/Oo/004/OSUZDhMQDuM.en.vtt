technique<00:01:29.230> to<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.530> hamstring<00:01:29.980> are<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:30.730> am

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
technique to the hamstring are I am

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.290 
technique to the hamstring are I am
going<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.960> passively<00:01:32.920> move<00:01:33.280> her<00:01:33.550> into<00:01:34.060> knee

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
going to passively move her into knee

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.560 
going to passively move her into knee
flexion<00:01:34.690> I'm<00:01:35.560> gonna<00:01:35.800> have<00:01:36.100> her<00:01:36.430> engage<00:01:37.120> her

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
flexion I'm gonna have her engage her

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.160 
flexion I'm gonna have her engage her
tissue<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.430> slowly<00:01:39.570> resists<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.750> pull<00:01:40.990> of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
tissue and slowly resists the pull of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.450 
tissue and slowly resists the pull of
the<00:01:41.290> band<00:01:41.560> for<00:01:42.460> 10<00:01:42.820> seconds<00:01:43.600> lowering<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.200> down

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the band for 10 seconds lowering it down

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.810 
the band for 10 seconds lowering it down
while<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.490> do<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:45.910> deep<00:01:46.270> stripping<00:01:46.870> stroke<00:01:47.820> seven

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
while I do a deep stripping stroke seven

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.970 
while I do a deep stripping stroke seven
out<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.000> ten<00:01:49.420> on<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.750> verbal<00:01:50.050> pressure<00:01:50.500> scale

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
out of ten on a verbal pressure scale

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.750 
out of ten on a verbal pressure scale
and<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.840> she<00:01:53.260> has<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.620> down<00:01:53.800> what<00:01:54.520> we're<00:01:54.670> gonna

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
and so she has it down what we're gonna

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.360 
and so she has it down what we're gonna
do<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.300> begin<00:01:55.870> right<00:01:56.320> now<00:01:56.350> I'm<00:01:57.130> gonna

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
do is begin right now I'm gonna

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.990 
do is begin right now I'm gonna
passively<00:01:58.030> move<00:01:58.420> her<00:01:58.630> into<00:01:58.870> knee<00:01:59.380> flexion

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
passively move her into knee flexion

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.360 
passively move her into knee flexion
engage<00:02:01.000> your<00:02:01.330> tissue<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.960> slowly<00:02:02.800> lower<00:02:03.700> down

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
engage your tissue and slowly lower down

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.950 
engage your tissue and slowly lower down
about<00:02:06.370> an<00:02:06.550> inch<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.300> second<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:13.090> first<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.720> up

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
about an inch a second and I first go up

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.640 
about an inch a second and I first go up
the<00:02:14.260> lateral<00:02:14.800> aspect<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.820> hamstring<00:02:16.650> then

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
the lateral aspect of the hamstring then

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
the lateral aspect of the hamstring then
I<00:02:18.100> go<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.090> central<00:02:19.920> aspect<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
I go up the central aspect of the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.230 
I go up the central aspect of the
hamstring

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:45.870 

and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.610> medial<00:02:34.060> aspect

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.880 

one<00:02:46.880> more<00:02:47.120> pass<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:50.030> normally<00:02:50.570> will<00:02:50.750> do<00:02:50.990> five

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
one more pass we normally will do five

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.770 
one more pass we normally will do five
sets<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:53.770> these<00:02:54.770> three<00:02:55.160> 10-second<00:02:56.090> passes<00:02:56.600> to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
sets of these three 10-second passes to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.830 
sets of these three 10-second passes to
the<00:02:56.900> hamstring<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.850> our<00:02:59.030> research<00:02:59.240> we

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the hamstring and in our research we

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.200 
the hamstring and in our research we
found<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.100> under<00:03:01.370> three<00:03:01.670> minutes<00:03:01.880> we

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
found that in under three minutes we

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.660

have her shorten her muscle again and
I'm<00:04:58.419> gonna<00:04:58.539> do<00:04:58.780> have<00:04:59.080> her<00:04:59.490> plantar<00:05:00.490> flex

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
I'm gonna do have her plantar flex

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.629 
I'm gonna do have her plantar flex
quickly<00:05:01.509> as<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.810> stripped<00:05:02.740> just<00:05:03.219> through<00:05:03.490> the

try to break up that myofascial

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.709 
try to break up that myofascial
restriction<00:05:29.169> and<00:05:29.919> this<00:05:30.879> is<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.539> really

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
restriction and this is really really

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.159 
restriction and this is really really
good<00:05:32.080> for<00:05:32.289> runners<00:05:33.000> also<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.779> tibialis

working<00:05:44.529> right<00:05:44.919> now<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:46.169> so<00:05:47.169> then<00:05:47.529> after<00:05:47.919> I<00:05:48.400> do

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
working right now and so then after I do

working right now and so then after I do
this<00:05:49.089> work<00:05:49.389> I<00:05:49.719> would<00:05:50.169> generally<00:05:50.440> finish<00:05:51.279> with
