00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
listening and listening in to wait for a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
listening and listening in to wait for a
pause<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.800> pause<00:00:53.070> creates<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> little

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
pause and that pause creates a little

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.889 
pause and that pause creates a little
gap<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:56.449> basically<00:00:57.449> wait<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
gap do you have to basically wait you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.380 
gap do you have to basically wait you
can<00:00:58.020> lose<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.410> time<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.640> hold

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
can lose some time so now if you hold

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.049 
can lose some time so now if you hold
down<00:01:00.660> Siri<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.890> hold<00:01:02.430> down<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> home

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
down Siri and you hold down the home

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
down Siri and you hold down the home
button<00:01:03.120> until<00:01:03.660> you're<00:01:04.019> done<00:01:04.409> talking<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> Siri

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
button until you're done talking to Siri

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
button until you're done talking to Siri
it<00:01:06.030> will<00:01:06.210> stop<00:01:06.450> immediately<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.229> hold

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it will stop immediately so you can hold

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:19.899 
it will stop immediately so you can hold
down<00:01:07.850> hi<00:01:08.850> Siri<00:01:09.150> how<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:13.280> what<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.369> today

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.450 

so<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.470> difference<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.650> isn't<00:01:22.979> huge<00:01:23.340> but

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so the difference there isn't huge but

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.050 
so the difference there isn't huge but
we<00:01:24.150> imagine<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.900> Siri<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.549> may

we imagine if you use Siri a lot you may

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
we imagine if you use Siri a lot you may
see<00:01:27.119> some<00:01:27.659> performance<00:01:28.200> gains<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.220> your

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
see some performance gains just in your

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
see some performance gains just in your
productivity<00:01:29.850> we're<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.509> having<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> wait

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
productivity we're not having to wait

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
productivity we're not having to wait
for<00:01:31.200> Siri<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.680> figure<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.070> you're<00:01:32.159> done

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
for Siri to figure out if you're done

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.690 
for Siri to figure out if you're done
talking<00:01:33.560> next<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.920> some<00:01:35.070> changes<00:01:35.460> to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
ID you can use the device and you

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.190 
ID you can use the device and you
shouldn't<00:04:12.030> have<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> worry<00:04:12.450> about<00:04:12.570> touch<00:04:13.019> ID

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200

great for the first two weeks and then
if<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.170> retrain<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.770> that's<00:04:27.950> great<00:04:28.070> for

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
if you retrain it that's great for

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.080 
if you retrain it that's great for
another<00:04:28.430> two<00:04:28.640> weeks
