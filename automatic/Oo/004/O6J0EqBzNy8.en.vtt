00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.330
 Evacuate to the first floor because it is the top prize 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:01.320

 You can do it when you reach level 19 of the child to explain 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.250
 2 people and 2 people 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.280
 I It is in Polygonum have this selection 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.470
 I think it would be better to go alone 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:09.580
 But two people but it is good even two people would make you stand only one person can not get 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:14.220
 If I buy it and the mission is over, I'll have a bit of trouble, so this one time 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.590
 It is not necessary to finish this mission separately , so close this a little 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.270
 Please start by any means 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:26.110
 It is it 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:28.710
 I will tell you where there is an empty stuff in Trevor , so if you go there it will always be 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.610
 Please think 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.940

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.940
 Good 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.980
 It was a foot 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.980
 8 I guess I have to go there 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.420
 I'm ignoring it and I 'm running here . 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:57.920
 Why do Kaiserslautern stayed over there and go running over here 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.720
 Why do we do have a lever is close but I do not know why 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.100
 Or so is I was looking for a little Nante Hey Trevor but a 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:11.740
 I do not know Bach 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.740
 Please It is it going to have to I Is this the home of the garage that'll be carried out in 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.419
 I always respawn here so this is my home 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.669
 I'll take it with you, but before you start the mission 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.139
 Please roughly check your home location on the map. The mark of your home during the mission is 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.190
 It does not appear at all 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.620
 a 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.010
 If I do not remember the sleeping place in the garage I'm around here but I decided around here 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.720
 It will be in the form of marking back 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:46.260
 Though it will Nee little leisurely drive up to it and was worth so considerably far 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:51.960
 I will only tell you this position 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:56.850
 It also modified by I can quite do little in this car Tsu enter this Nee 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.000
 Meisa items that feel a bit sunburning will become coloring 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.000
 so 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:09.000
 I though I would only there it seems a little disappointing track feeling 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:13.800
 So hey yeah it is a quick look at how you are remodeling from here 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.070
 I want to end by showing a bit of how I'm working with foreigners in the wild again 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.070
 I will 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.389
 You are looking at it now but it looks like you 're remodeling 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.910
 That pretty much various bread can be put on it 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.870
 Light cover Yara 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.409
 that 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:39.849
 There are also parts like frame 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.849
 I can play with a variety of things, but my favorite morning corner 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:49.090
 Horny つ け If you can put on something like this car alone 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.419
 From where I hardly Do this What do 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.419
 Oh, this is the corner of this column before and after 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.030
 I can put one more behind the light 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.240
 Please try to find out why 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.060
 Color is hey 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.570

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:11.830
 What I still people never done'm originally people never done it only that solo car mods 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:14.560

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.310
 Hmm

 Let's get insurance after putting a car in your empty space in the warehouse 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:30.830
 I would like to make someone blow up 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:34.220
 In the unlikely event that it is broken or rushed into the water, it will not return without insurance and will wait 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:39.139
 It is necessary to get it over again 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.390
 You can get insurance at a custom shop, so be sure to keep it in mind 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:46.060
 About it 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.060
