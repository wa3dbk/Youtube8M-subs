and I think probably the slow start they
are<00:03:11.169> they<00:03:11.290> were<00:03:11.349> almost<00:03:11.919> 80<00:03:12.340> runs<00:03:12.609> after<00:03:12.760> 12

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
last eight over still go to 159 which I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.429 
last eight over still go to 159 which I
thought<00:03:19.329> was<00:03:19.479> a<00:03:19.569> probably<00:03:19.900> good<00:03:20.049> code<00:03:20.259> but

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
thought was a probably good code but

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.080 
thought was a probably good code but
Jeff<00:03:20.859> food<00:03:21.009> is<00:03:21.129> turning<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.729> be<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:22.030> dead

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
Jeff food is turning out to be a dead

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.550 
Jeff food is turning out to be a dead
spent<00:03:22.449> four<00:03:22.569> teams<00:03:22.780> wedding<00:03:23.079> first<00:03:23.259> you<00:03:23.439> know

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
spent four teams wedding first you know

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.469 
spent four teams wedding first you know
so<00:03:23.949> I<00:03:23.979> think<00:03:24.250> from<00:03:24.370> now<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.609> nobody<00:03:25.000> will<00:03:25.299> bat

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
so I think from now on nobody will bat

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.969 
so I think from now on nobody will bat
first<00:03:25.720> know<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.229> would<00:03:26.349> like<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.500> bat<00:03:26.769> first

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
first know we would like to bat first

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.740 
first know we would like to bat first
because<00:03:27.310> changing<00:03:27.909> has<00:03:28.000> been<00:03:28.150> easy<00:03:28.269> but<00:03:28.540> I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
because changing has been easy but I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.830 
because changing has been easy but I
think<00:03:29.129> they<00:03:30.129> didn't<00:03:30.729> expect<00:03:31.030> knight<00:03:31.449> riders

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
think they didn't expect knight riders

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.689 
think they didn't expect knight riders
to<00:03:32.199> play<00:03:32.349> like<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.680> as<00:03:33.009> you<00:03:33.370> look<00:03:33.489> at<00:03:33.639> the

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
to play like this as you look at the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.319 
to play like this as you look at the
fall<00:03:33.909> of<00:03:34.030> its<00:03:34.319> always<00:03:35.319> looking<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:37.090> coming

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
fall of its always looking like coming

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.999 
fall of its always looking like coming
over<00:03:37.419> to<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.659> plan<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:37.870> follow<00:03:38.259> anything<00:03:38.650> low

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:39.009

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
that kept low of use of catan but then

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.080 
that kept low of use of catan but then
when<00:03:43.840> when<00:03:44.290> KKR<00:03:44.829> came<00:03:45.009> out<00:03:45.159> to<00:03:45.280> bat<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.879> pitch

the quality of the paddock it was

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.009 
the quality of the paddock it was
undoubtedly<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.090> qualities<00:03:52.540> are<00:03:52.659> batting

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019

you know you should take a look at
Gotham<00:03:55.359> Gumby<00:03:55.780> runnin<00:03:56.259> just<00:03:56.979> look<00:03:57.159> at<00:03:57.250> the

know<00:04:00.129> who<00:04:00.489> are<00:04:00.639> getting<00:04:01.030> chain<00:04:01.419> one<00:04:01.810> against

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
know who are getting chain one against

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.129 
know who are getting chain one against
the<00:04:02.560> turn<00:04:02.859> over<00:04:03.310> extra<00:04:03.669> cover<00:04:03.699> so<00:04:04.569> that<00:04:04.840> is

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
the turn over extra cover so that is

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.719 
the turn over extra cover so that is
probably<00:04:05.349> one<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.829> most<00:04:05.919> difficult<00:04:06.189> shots

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
probably one of the most difficult shots

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.640 
probably one of the most difficult shots
to<00:04:06.939> play<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.689> he<00:04:07.870> played<00:04:08.139> it<00:04:08.290> with<00:04:08.409> such<00:04:08.620> ease

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
to play and he played it with such ease

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.800 
to play and he played it with such ease
you<00:04:09.069> know<00:04:09.129> he<00:04:09.340> got<00:04:09.969> himself<00:04:10.180> into<00:04:10.479> a<00:04:10.659> position

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you know he got himself into a position

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.069 
you know he got himself into a position
to<00:04:11.199> be<00:04:11.229> play<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.919> be<00:04:12.069> playing<00:04:12.310> inside<00:04:13.090> out<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.689> a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
ball that's coming in so yeah it was the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.469 
ball that's coming in so yeah it was the
quality<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.859> batting<00:04:18.219> and<00:04:18.370> I've<00:04:19.030> got<00:04:19.329> to

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
quality of the batting and I've got to

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.159 
quality of the batting and I've got to
say<00:04:19.659> that<00:04:19.690> without<00:04:20.079> Shaun<00:04:20.620> Tait<00:04:20.829> this<00:04:21.549> bowling

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
say that without Shaun Tait this bowling

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.129 
say that without Shaun Tait this bowling
resources<00:04:23.169> rather<00:04:23.320> meager

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
resources rather meager
