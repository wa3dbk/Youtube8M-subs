I'm<00:01:17.790> incredibly<00:01:18.270> lucky<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.380> built<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
I'm incredibly lucky to have built this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.080 
I'm incredibly lucky to have built this
collection<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.280> equipment<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.700> over<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
collection of equipment up over the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749 
collection of equipment up over the
years<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> say<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> case

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
years but as I say for me this is a case

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
years but as I say for me this is a case
of<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.090> being<00:01:24.330> able<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> open<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.020> stuff<00:01:25.229> up

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of now being able to open this stuff up

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
of now being able to open this stuff up
and<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.890> share<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> guys<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and actually share it with you guys so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
and actually share it with you guys so
that<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.080> musical<00:01:28.470> parts<00:01:28.860> from

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that you can have musical parts from

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
that you can have musical parts from
some<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.030> classic<00:01:30.360> equipment<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:31.590> right

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
some of this classic equipment all right

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.660 
some of this classic equipment all right
let<00:01:31.860> me<00:01:31.890> show<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> differences<00:01:32.610> between

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
let me show you the differences between

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:50.170 
let me show you the differences between
the<00:01:33.030> two

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.520 

and<00:01:51.180> instantly<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:51.960> hear<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> sound<00:01:52.410> gets

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and instantly you hear the sound gets

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.470 
and instantly you hear the sound gets
bigger<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> gets<00:01:53.040> fatter<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.790> gets<00:01:54.030> wider<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
bigger it gets fatter it gets wider and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.180 
bigger it gets fatter it gets wider and
it's<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.900> you've<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.380> real<00:01:55.620> drifting

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
it's because you've got real drifting

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.090 
it's because you've got real drifting
analog<00:01:56.550> oscillators<00:01:57.530> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.590> falling<00:01:58.890> about

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
analog oscillators kind of falling about

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.890 
analog oscillators kind of falling about
in<00:01:59.250> each<00:01:59.340> other<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.700> everything's<00:02:00.060> set<00:02:00.720> here

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
in each other that everything's set here

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.930 
in each other that everything's set here
in<00:02:00.990> unison<00:02:01.380> mode<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.010> Jupiter<00:02:02.190> 8<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:02.730> it's

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
in unison mode on the Jupiter 8 and it's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.360 
in unison mode on the Jupiter 8 and it's
something<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.480> even<00:02:03.690> though<00:02:04.220> vsts<00:02:05.220> are

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
something that even though vsts are

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.920 
something that even though vsts are
getting<00:02:05.550> really<00:02:05.760> good<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:05.940> emulating<00:02:06.480> from<00:02:06.780> my

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
getting really good at emulating from my

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.590 
getting really good at emulating from my
opinion<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.890> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> can't<00:02:08.490> be<00:02:08.670> but

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
opinion you just kind of can't be but

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.270 
opinion you just kind of can't be but
there's<00:02:09.720> also<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.170> beauty<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> being<00:02:10.680> able<00:02:11.040> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
there's also the beauty of being able to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.980 
there's also the beauty of being able to
grab<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> controls<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> hardware<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
grab the controls of the hardware and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.560 
grab the controls of the hardware and
actually<00:02:13.620> record<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.760> whilst<00:02:15.000> you're<00:02:15.270> playing

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
actually record it whilst you're playing

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.090 
actually record it whilst you're playing
a<00:02:16.170> part<00:02:16.380> through<00:02:16.530> let<00:02:16.710> me<00:02:16.770> show<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.070> I

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
a part through let me show you what I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:41.240 
a part through let me show you what I
mean

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.350 

and<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.520> kind<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.820> tactile<00:02:43.150> control

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
and it's that kind of tactile control

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.210 
and it's that kind of tactile control
with<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.840> equipment<00:02:44.080> they're<00:02:44.560> really

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
with this equipment they're really

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.520 
with this equipment they're really
starting<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.550> come<00:02:45.820> back<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.270> people's<00:02:47.230> live

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
starting to come back in people's live

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.670 
starting to come back in people's live
setups<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.480> studio<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.960> well<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
setups and in the studio as well and the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.100 
setups and in the studio as well and the
fascination<00:02:51.160> again<00:02:51.490> with<00:02:51.640> hardware<00:02:52.110> really

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
fascination again with hardware really

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.720 
fascination again with hardware really
brings<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> fore<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.010> power<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.610> you

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
brings to the fore the power that you

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.430 
brings to the fore the power that you
have<00:02:54.940> when<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.270> actually<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.930> physical

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
have when you actually have a physical

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.600 
have when you actually have a physical
control<00:02:56.800> over<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> things<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.520> you're

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
control over the things that you're

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.580 
control over the things that you're
doing<00:02:57.760> instead<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.300> just<00:02:58.480> dealing<00:02:58.959> with<00:02:59.140> a

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
doing instead of just dealing with a

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.060 
doing instead of just dealing with a
mouse<00:03:00.310> wheel<00:03:00.550> or<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> mouse<00:03:01.060> pointer<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.920> now

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
mouse wheel or a mouse pointer and now

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.350 
mouse wheel or a mouse pointer and now
we've<00:03:03.190> got<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> baseline<00:03:03.580> kind<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:03.940> working<00:03:04.270> in

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
we've got a baseline kind of working in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.850 
we've got a baseline kind of working in
there<00:03:04.510> let<00:03:04.660> me<00:03:04.690> show<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.990> how<00:03:05.110> quickly<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.680> can

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
there let me show you how quickly we can

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:21.020 
there let me show you how quickly we can
just<00:03:06.100> kind<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.810> change<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> sound<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.940> this

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.190 

and<00:03:22.030> once<00:03:22.390> again<00:03:22.510> I've<00:03:22.840> got<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.050> whole<00:03:23.170> thing

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
and once again I've got the whole thing

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.020 
and once again I've got the whole thing
arms<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.980> things<00:03:24.190> live<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:24.850> just

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
arms the things live and I can just

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.270 
arms the things live and I can just
literally<00:03:25.360> pray<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.959> simple<00:03:26.739> live<00:03:27.040> riser

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
literally pray a simple live riser

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:40.920 
literally pray a simple live riser
straight<00:03:27.640> into<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.870> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
straight into this and that is the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.390 
straight into this and that is the
beauty<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.260> being<00:03:41.470> able<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.709> grab<00:03:41.980> Hardware

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
beauty of being able to grab Hardware

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.789 
beauty of being able to grab Hardware
you<00:03:42.519> can<00:03:42.670> literally<00:03:43.230> almost<00:03:44.230> play<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.590> stuff

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
you can literally almost play the stuff

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:45.720 
you can literally almost play the stuff
in<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.250> for<00:03:45.400> me

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
in and for me

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.310 
in and for me
analog<00:03:46.269> oscillators<00:03:46.750> when<00:03:46.900> they<00:03:46.989> start<00:03:47.230> to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
analog oscillators when they start to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.140 
analog oscillators when they start to
get<00:03:47.440> going<00:03:47.709> just<00:03:47.950> sound<00:03:48.220> an<00:03:48.519> awful<00:03:48.850> lot<00:03:48.970> more

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
get going just sound an awful lot more

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.460 
get going just sound an awful lot more
like<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.330> record<00:03:49.750> than<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.140> would<00:03:50.320> normally

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
like a record than you would normally

00:03:50.470 --> 00:04:06.970 
like a record than you would normally
get<00:03:50.860> with<00:03:51.670> anything<00:03:52.000> that's<00:03:52.150> built<00:03:52.299> digitally

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.770 

so<00:04:07.980> here's<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.250> slightly<00:04:08.460> more<00:04:08.670> caudal<00:04:09.030> sound

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.330 

and<00:04:15.780> again<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.620> great<00:04:16.769> thing<00:04:16.920> about<00:04:16.950> analog

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and again the great thing about analog

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.839 
and again the great thing about analog
or<00:04:18.030> hardware

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.100 

I've<00:04:22.849> got<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.090> controls<00:04:23.449> I<00:04:23.569> can<00:04:23.750> actually

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
I've got the controls I can actually

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.510 
I've got the controls I can actually
move<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> about<00:04:24.979> whilst<00:04:25.189> I'm<00:04:25.370> actually

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
move it about whilst I'm actually

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.820 
move it about whilst I'm actually
praying<00:04:25.849> so<00:04:26.060> let's<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:26.659> put<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> quick<00:04:27.560> little

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
praying so let's just put a quick little

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.499 
praying so let's just put a quick little
core<00:04:28.009> part<00:04:28.280> over<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.090> stuff<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.419> we're

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
core part over the stuff that we're

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:48.900 
core part over the stuff that we're
building

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.100 

and<00:04:49.910> that's<00:04:50.150> one<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.390> beauties<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.810> found

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
and that's one of the beauties I found

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.140 
and that's one of the beauties I found
out<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.650> using<00:04:51.980> hardware<00:04:52.280> as<00:04:52.370> well<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.820> really

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
out of using hardware as well it really

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.940 
out of using hardware as well it really
makes<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.480> concentrate<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:54.230> building<00:04:54.470> sounds

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
makes you concentrate on building sounds

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.220 
makes you concentrate on building sounds
that<00:04:55.100> work<00:04:55.630> specifically<00:04:56.630> within<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:57.020> track

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
that work specifically within a track

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.750 
that work specifically within a track
and<00:04:57.590> as<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.740> say<00:04:57.860> that's<00:04:57.980> one<00:04:58.220> thing<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.490> I'm

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
and as I say that's one thing that I'm

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.660 
and as I say that's one thing that I'm
incredibly<00:04:59.860> passionate<00:05:00.860> about<00:05:01.190> with<00:05:01.490> all<00:05:01.580> the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
incredibly passionate about with all the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.130 
incredibly passionate about with all the
stuff<00:05:01.880> I'm<00:05:02.000> trying<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.300> do<00:05:02.360> with<00:05:02.510> f9<00:05:02.780> Audio<00:05:03.080> is

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
stuff I'm trying to do with f9 Audio is

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.990 
stuff I'm trying to do with f9 Audio is
that<00:05:03.350> these<00:05:03.680> parts<00:05:04.130> actually<00:05:04.340> work<00:05:04.790> together

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
that these parts actually work together

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.700 
that these parts actually work together
musically<00:05:05.600> they're<00:05:05.780> not<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:06.110> created<00:05:06.530> in

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
musically they're not just created in

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.400 
musically they're not just created in
isolation<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.720> this<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:08.960> what<00:05:09.080> we've<00:05:09.200> just

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
isolation and so this is what we've just

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.600 
isolation and so this is what we've just
managed<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.740> knock<00:05:09.890> up<00:05:10.070> in<00:05:10.190> just<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.490> few

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
managed to knock up in just a few

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.400 
managed to knock up in just a few
minutes<00:05:10.730> using<00:05:11.360> some<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:11.810> beautiful<00:05:12.320> old

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
minutes using some of this beautiful old

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:29.940 
minutes using some of this beautiful old
hardware

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.590 

and<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.640> thing<00:05:31.790> is<00:05:31.820> with<00:05:32.120> some<00:05:32.300> of<00:05:32.330> this<00:05:32.480> stuff

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
and the thing is with some of this stuff

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.910 
and the thing is with some of this stuff
these<00:05:32.900> synths<00:05:33.350> are<00:05:33.440> starting<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.800> disappear

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
these synths are starting to disappear

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.980 
these synths are starting to disappear
because<00:05:34.580> they're<00:05:34.940> ancient<00:05:35.390> they're<00:05:35.570> that

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
because they're ancient they're that

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.630 
because they're ancient they're that
this<00:05:36.200> thing<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:36.590> nearly<00:05:36.860> as<00:05:36.950> old<00:05:37.070> as<00:05:37.250> me<00:05:37.400> and

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
this thing is nearly as old as me and

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.400 
this thing is nearly as old as me and
some<00:05:38.420> of<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.570> components<00:05:39.020> are<00:05:39.080> starting<00:05:39.350> to

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
some of the components are starting to

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.980 
some of the components are starting to
fail<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:39.950> it's<00:05:40.280> actually<00:05:40.690> exciting<00:05:41.690> for<00:05:41.840> me<00:05:41.960> to

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
fail so it's actually exciting for me to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.720 
fail so it's actually exciting for me to
be<00:05:42.290> able<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.740> hopefully<00:05:43.190> preserve<00:05:43.520> this<00:05:43.670> for

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
be able to hopefully preserve this for

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.790 
be able to hopefully preserve this for
future<00:05:44.120> generations<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.530> have<00:05:45.650> some

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
future generations and to have some

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.290 
future generations and to have some
musical<00:05:46.100> parts<00:05:46.400> some<00:05:46.520> samples<00:05:46.910> of<00:05:46.970> it<00:05:47.120> some

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
musical parts some samples of it some

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.880 
musical parts some samples of it some
chords<00:05:47.660> and<00:05:48.200> some<00:05:48.440> other<00:05:48.560> bits<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.800> pieces

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890
