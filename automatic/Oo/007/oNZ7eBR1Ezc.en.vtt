so<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:46.560> example<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.400> sea<00:03:47.700> serpent<00:03:48.060> is

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
so for example if the sea serpent is

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.060 
so for example if the sea serpent is
placed<00:03:48.360> here<00:03:48.510> he<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.470> highest<00:03:49.800> strength

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.890 
placed here he is the highest strength
in<00:03:50.220> either<00:03:50.459> line<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.060> he<00:03:51.540> would<00:03:51.660> score<00:03:51.870> two

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
in either line so he would score two

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.780 
in either line so he would score two
points<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.590> column<00:03:52.830> but<00:03:53.430> would<00:03:53.550> end<00:03:53.700> up

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
points for this column but would end up

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.310

how you play velu spa one of the things
I<00:04:35.639> like<00:04:35.789> most<00:04:35.849> about<00:04:36.240> velu<00:04:36.690> Spa<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.169> just<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
I like most about velu Spa is just the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.760 
I like most about velu Spa is just the
artwork<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.370> think<00:04:38.400> it's<00:04:38.669> beautiful<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.990> the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
artwork I think it's beautiful the the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.129 
artwork I think it's beautiful the the
colors<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.400> are<00:04:41.669> used<00:04:42.000> on<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> tiles<00:04:42.780> the

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
colors that are used on the tiles the

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.920 
colors that are used on the tiles the
way<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.190> sort<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.520> looks<00:04:44.789> comic<00:04:45.389> booky<00:04:45.690> and

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
way it sort of looks comic booky and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.350 
way it sort of looks comic booky and
cartoony<00:04:46.650> without<00:04:46.919> being<00:04:47.160> too<00:04:47.550> animated<00:04:48.030> or

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
cartoony without being too animated or

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.540 
cartoony without being too animated or
goofy<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.110> just<00:04:49.410> has<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> really<00:04:49.650> really<00:04:50.190> nice

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
goofy it just has a really really nice

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.350 
goofy it just has a really really nice
sense<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.240> presence<00:04:52.080> on<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.650> table<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:53.360> just

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
sense of presence on the table and just

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.809 
sense of presence on the table and just
a<00:04:54.539> really<00:04:55.199> good<00:04:55.440> aesthetic<00:04:56.220> when<00:04:56.430> you're<00:04:56.580> when

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
a really good aesthetic when you're when

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.189 
a really good aesthetic when you're when
you're<00:04:56.940> playing<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.449> game<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.870> that's

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
you're playing the game and that's

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.200 
you're playing the game and that's
pretty<00:04:58.380> good<00:04:58.560> because<00:04:58.919> as<00:04:59.130> an<00:04:59.400> abstract<00:04:59.759> game

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
pretty good because as an abstract game

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.999 
pretty good because as an abstract game
it<00:05:00.419> really<00:05:00.449> doesn't<00:05:00.840> need<00:05:01.020> any<00:05:01.289> of<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.650> it

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
it really doesn't need any of that it

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.770 
it really doesn't need any of that it
pretty<00:05:02.550> much<00:05:02.639> lives<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.210> dies<00:05:03.330> by<00:05:03.389> its

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
pretty much lives and dies by its

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.930 
pretty much lives and dies by its
mechanics<00:05:04.319> but<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.740> nice<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.009> see<00:05:05.310> really

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
mechanics but it is nice to see really

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.360 
mechanics but it is nice to see really
nice<00:05:06.479> high<00:05:06.870> quality<00:05:06.900> art<00:05:07.680> in<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.979> game<00:05:08.130> like

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
nice high quality art in the game like

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.580 
nice high quality art in the game like
this<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.789> only<00:05:09.360> wish<00:05:09.509> that<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:10.050> tiles<00:05:10.409> were<00:05:10.530> a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
this I only wish that the tiles were a
