 functions in practice 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.910
 we start with the manual setting 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.970
 manually then we place the filter 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.229
 carry on the support under the spout 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.390

 pressing the spout starts to grind it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 had to retreat to this again in the

 Fashion stops when we now have the for 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.650
 programmed timer mode 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.390

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 we set up the switch on the left 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.040
 the t of timer turns white if this button is the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.920
 front you can adjust the quantity now 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.450

 possible if the machine is out 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.770
 continuously turn the grinding position continuously 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.690
 so you can do any desired grinding degree 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.690
