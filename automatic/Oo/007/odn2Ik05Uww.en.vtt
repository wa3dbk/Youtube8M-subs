00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 another slightly larger lamp 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:22.010
 lamberti d35 from extra comes in my 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:25.730
 case that has possible here with 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:34.290
 lanyard and capes part 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:38.160
 Everything is nicely arranged here in the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.379
 case in there but we really want 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.820
 Get together the lamp are 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.850
 pretty massive part 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:52.489
 so waterproof and that's what she goes for 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.489
 up to 2300 lumens 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.920
 Let's see what the write there 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.920
 waterproofness up to 100 meters say 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.530
 So now a pretty massive part 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.689
 2000 350 lumens which is really funny 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.350
 she has a level here 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.950
 can set freely then only on 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.189
 reset then go the first time by 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.140
 Made it easy to get down there 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.090
 wants it or when it starts to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.369
 blink where you put the pink cross 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.729
 If you switch to preset then that is there 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.430
 saved so this thing is a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.900
 previously stored value the feet there 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.990
 you can do everything possible 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.590
 lower brightness or too and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590
 left signal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 and then you can go with it 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.759
 and hey how exactly the walls are professionals 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.299
 to say yes because you anyway 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.770
 a store can 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.630
 maybe not quite clean 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.580
 made that part of it here behind 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:16.739
 everything is going very well 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:18.870
 sealed here are two earrings 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.280
 inside back is sealed again 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.019
 That should not be so 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.010
 Three different batteries should of course 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.870
 Not be 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.060
 by the way, are so gockel the lamp 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.880
 even two sakkos are included 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:44.790
 supplied and that at least 3400 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.410
 of extra scope of delivery also in 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.410
 this carton in it 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.769
 the lanyard well I still have in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.450
 course trainer can of course here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.530
 be attached and here is the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.840
 maybe that's why the two 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.959
 lanyards that one maybe 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.000
 So somehow, a couple is very much coupled together 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.130
 massive part but wonderful I saw 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.910
 Unfortunately, I can not be sure of that 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.910
 to use
