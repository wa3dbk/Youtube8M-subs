00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.519 

today<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:01.979> looking<00:00:02.100> at<00:00:02.429> LOD<00:00:02.970> uh<00:00:03.319> which<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.500> a

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
today we're looking at LOD uh which is a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.410 
today we're looking at LOD uh which is a
water<00:00:04.859> plant<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.430> we're<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> put<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.720> in

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
water plant and we're going to put it in

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.350 
water plant and we're going to put it in
tap<00:00:09.420> water<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.429> we're<00:00:11.429> also<00:00:11.610> going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> put<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
tap water and we're also going to put it

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.950 
tap water and we're also going to put it
under<00:00:12.960> some<00:00:13.500> salt<00:00:14.219> water<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.839> see<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
under some salt water and see the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.470 
under some salt water and see the
difference<00:00:16.320> we're<00:00:16.680> studying<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.580> water

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
difference we're studying about water

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
difference we're studying about water
moving<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.260> out<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> cells<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
moving in and out of cells so this is a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.710 
moving in and out of cells so this is a
great<00:00:20.910> lab<00:00:21.289> to<00:00:22.289> see<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.920> action<00:00:23.720> all

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
great lab to see this in action all

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.810 
great lab to see this in action all
right<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> start<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.670> some

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
right so we're going to start with some

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.970 
right so we're going to start with some
LOD<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.930> water<00:00:28.140> plant<00:00:28.470> fresh<00:00:28.769> water

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
LOD a little water plant fresh water

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.139 
LOD a little water plant fresh water
plant<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.380> your<00:00:31.380> lab<00:00:31.560> tells<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.730> pluck

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
plant and your lab tells you to pluck

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.810 
plant and your lab tells you to pluck
off<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> leaf<00:00:33.800> one<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:35.070> tiny<00:00:35.280> leaf<00:00:35.579> from

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
off a leaf one little tiny leaf from

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.799 
off a leaf one little tiny leaf from
here<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:38.870> take<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.230> leaflet<00:00:41.719> put<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
here and take one little leaflet put it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.709 
here and take one little leaflet put it
on<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.379> slide<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:45.350> then<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> add<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
on my slide and then I'm going to add a

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.520 
on my slide and then I'm going to add a
drop<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> water<00:00:49.350> tap<00:00:50.010> water<00:00:51.140> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> fresh

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
drop of water tap water this is fresh

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
drop of water tap water this is fresh
water<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> water<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:56.489> LOD<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
water so this is water that this LOD a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.090 
water so this is water that this LOD a
plant<00:00:58.100> likes<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:01.260> used<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
plant likes it's used to this kind of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
plant likes it's used to this kind of
water<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.510> we're<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> put

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
water here we go and we're going to put

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.880 
water here we go and we're going to put
it<00:01:06.930> under<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> microscope<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.000> view<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.890> okay

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it under the microscope and view it okay

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.550 
it under the microscope and view it okay
so<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.350> got<00:01:13.350> my<00:01:13.470> microscope<00:01:14.010> set<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:15.560> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so I got my microscope set up here and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.330 
so I got my microscope set up here and
I'm<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.119> stage<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
I'm going to put it on the stage and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.639 
I'm going to put it on the stage and
we'll<00:01:20.340> view<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.830 

oops<00:01:28.860> Center<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.680 

and<00:01:33.080> once<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:34.070> zoom<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:34.640> on<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.650> look<00:01:36.650> at<00:01:36.860> it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
and once I zoom in on it and look at it

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.399 
and once I zoom in on it and look at it
it's<00:01:38.690> gonna<00:01:38.810> look<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.080> this<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.950> don't<00:01:40.369> have<00:01:40.760> a

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
it's gonna look like this I don't have a

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.039 
it's gonna look like this I don't have a
hookup<00:01:42.409> for<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.610> camera<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.570> look<00:01:44.840> inside

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
hookup for the camera to to look inside

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.990 
hookup for the camera to to look inside
the<00:01:45.380> microscope<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.250> I'm<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:46.520> going<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.700> show

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
the microscope so I'm just going to show

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.410 
the microscope so I'm just going to show
you<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.800> what<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.700> cells<00:01:49.970> will<00:01:50.240> look

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
you this is what the cells will look

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.499 
you this is what the cells will look
like<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.110> you're<00:01:51.290> going<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:51.680> some<00:01:52.509> bricks

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
like so you're going to see some bricks

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.810 
like so you're going to see some bricks
those<00:01:53.930> are<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> cells<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.890> inside<00:01:55.250> those

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
those are the cells and inside those

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.440 
those are the cells and inside those
bricks<00:01:56.240> are<00:01:56.509> little<00:01:57.020> tiny<00:01:57.380> green<00:01:58.450> round

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
bricks are little tiny green round

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.889 
bricks are little tiny green round
structures<00:02:00.140> called<00:02:00.580> chloroplasts<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.899> if

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
structures called chloroplasts and if

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.580 
structures called chloroplasts and if
you<00:02:02.990> look<00:02:03.140> at<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.350> picture<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:03.680> can<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:03.950> that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
you look at the picture you can see that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.499 
you look at the picture you can see that
the<00:02:06.590> chloroplasts<00:02:07.160> are<00:02:07.220> all<00:02:07.429> over<00:02:07.880> spread

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
the chloroplasts are all over spread

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.280 
the chloroplasts are all over spread
evenly<00:02:08.840> throughout<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:10.150> that<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.870> normal

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
evenly throughout and that is the normal

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.590 
evenly throughout and that is the normal
state<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:13.690> elodea<00:02:14.690> under<00:02:15.200> tap<00:02:15.650> water<00:02:15.950> okay<00:02:16.600> so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
state of elodea under tap water okay so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.120 
state of elodea under tap water okay so
now<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.780> would<00:02:18.319> be<00:02:18.380> looking<00:02:18.739> in<00:02:19.040> your

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
now you would be looking in your

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.380 
now you would be looking in your
microscope<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.120> drawing<00:02:20.959> structures<00:02:22.390> you

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
microscope and drawing structures you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.900 
microscope and drawing structures you
should<00:02:23.630> look<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.440> cell<00:02:25.069> wall<00:02:25.340> which<00:02:25.640> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
should look for the cell wall which is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.770 
should look for the cell wall which is
of<00:02:26.060> course<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> outer<00:02:26.660> boundary<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> cell

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
of course the outer boundary of the cell

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.809 
of course the outer boundary of the cell
right<00:02:29.780> inside<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.709> cell<00:02:30.950> wall<00:02:31.220> would<00:02:31.550> be<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
right inside the cell wall would be the

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.270 
right inside the cell wall would be the
cell<00:02:32.060> membrane<00:02:32.540> which<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:33.530> pressed<00:02:33.920> right

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
cell membrane which it's pressed right

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.370 
cell membrane which it's pressed right
up<00:02:34.340> against<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.300> inside<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.959> cell<00:02:36.170> wall

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
up against the inside of the cell wall

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.400 
up against the inside of the cell wall
and<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:37.579> course<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> chloroplasts<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
and of course the chloroplasts so you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.180 
and of course the chloroplasts so you
should<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.799> able<00:02:39.829> to<00:02:40.010> label<00:02:40.280> those<00:02:41.170> structures

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
should be able to label those structures

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.949 
should be able to label those structures
okay<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:45.049> different<00:02:45.920> situation<00:02:46.780> will<00:02:47.780> be

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
okay now a different situation will be

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.170 
okay now a different situation will be
when<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.590> look<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:49.209> alodia<00:02:50.209> in<00:02:50.450> salt<00:02:50.870> water<00:02:52.180> so

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
when you look at alodia in salt water so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.680 
when you look at alodia in salt water so
again<00:02:53.480> we're<00:02:53.930> going<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.110> take<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.560> slide<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
again we're going to take a slide and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.520 
again we're going to take a slide and
our<00:02:56.690> LOD<00:02:57.230> a'<00:02:57.260> leaflet<00:02:58.930> little<00:02:59.930> tiny<00:03:00.200> leaf

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
our LOD a' leaflet little tiny leaf

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.479 
our LOD a' leaflet little tiny leaf
single<00:03:01.100> leaf<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:03.410> thin<00:03:03.799> that<00:03:03.829> you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.250> see

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
single leaf so thin that you can see

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.530 
single leaf so thin that you can see
through<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:06.430> all<00:03:07.430> right<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.940> now<00:03:08.150> we're<00:03:08.450> going

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
through it all right and now we're going

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.390 
through it all right and now we're going
to<00:03:08.600> put<00:03:08.840> salt<00:03:09.799> water<00:03:11.500> salt<00:03:12.500> water<00:03:12.799> on<00:03:13.040> this

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
to put salt water salt water on this

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.390 
to put salt water salt water on this
leaf<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.590> normal<00:03:15.950> type<00:03:16.190> of

leaf and this is not the normal type of
water<00:03:16.900> invite<00:03:17.900> for<00:03:18.410> this<00:03:18.560> plant<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:20.350> we<00:03:21.350> put

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
water invite for this plant and we put

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.649 
water invite for this plant and we put
our<00:03:21.709> cover<00:03:21.920> slip<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.400> it

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.429 

and<00:03:26.890> once<00:03:27.890> again<00:03:28.040> we<00:03:28.760> would<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.480> putting<00:03:30.200> it

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 
and once again we would be putting it

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.479 
and once again we would be putting it
under<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.859> microscope<00:03:31.069> which<00:03:33.099> take<00:03:34.099> this<00:03:34.250> one

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
under the microscope which take this one

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.929 
under the microscope which take this one
off<00:03:34.670> that's<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.900> old<00:03:36.049> slide<00:03:36.579> put<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.700> salt

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
off that's the old slide put the salt

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:45.789 
off that's the old slide put the salt
water<00:03:38.209> slide<00:03:38.629> on<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.730> again<00:03:44.569> we<00:03:45.139> would<00:03:45.409> view

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
water slide on and again we would view

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.530 
water slide on and again we would view
that<00:03:45.859> under<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:46.939> microscope<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.239> time

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
that under the microscope and this time

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.300 
that under the microscope and this time
you<00:03:50.959> will<00:03:51.049> see<00:03:51.260> something<00:03:51.530> quite<00:03:51.799> different

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
you will see something quite different

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.899 
you will see something quite different
you<00:03:53.230> will<00:03:54.230> see<00:03:54.500> something<00:03:54.769> that<00:03:55.129> looks<00:03:55.159> like

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
you will see something that looks like

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.039 
you will see something that looks like
this<00:03:56.269> now<00:03:57.849> we<00:03:58.849> still<00:03:59.090> have<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.510> cell<00:03:59.780> wall

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
this now we still have the cell wall

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.710 
this now we still have the cell wall
which<00:04:00.980> is<00:04:01.189> this<00:04:01.989> kind<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.049> greyish<00:04:03.620> line

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
which is this kind of greyish line

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.649 
which is this kind of greyish line
rectangular<00:04:05.720> like<00:04:06.169> shape<00:04:07.150> but<00:04:08.150> all<00:04:08.419> the

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
rectangular like shape but all the

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.979 
rectangular like shape but all the
chloroplasts<00:04:09.500> have<00:04:09.650> kind<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.569> shrunken<00:04:11.569> into

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
chloroplasts have kind of shrunken into

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.520 
chloroplasts have kind of shrunken into
the<00:04:12.139> middle<00:04:12.379> of<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.650> cell<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:14.290> they're<00:04:15.290> kind

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the middle of the cell and they're kind

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.099 
the middle of the cell and they're kind
of<00:04:15.650> balled<00:04:16.549> up<00:04:16.820> or<00:04:17.090> bunched<00:04:17.389> up<00:04:17.509> in<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> middle

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
of balled up or bunched up in the middle

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.129 
of balled up or bunched up in the middle
and<00:04:18.289> where<00:04:19.280> I'm<00:04:19.400> tracing<00:04:19.699> my<00:04:19.910> finger<00:04:20.509> that<00:04:20.810> is

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
and where I'm tracing my finger that is

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.670 
and where I'm tracing my finger that is
where<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.829> cell<00:04:22.070> membrane<00:04:22.820> is

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
where the cell membrane is

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.510 
where the cell membrane is
all<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.070> water<00:04:25.370> came<00:04:26.300> out<00:04:26.509> of<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:29.180> cell

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
all of the water came out of that cell

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.839 
all of the water came out of that cell
so<00:04:31.870> kind<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> water<00:04:33.440> balloon<00:04:33.849> would

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
so kind of like a water balloon would

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.300 
so kind of like a water balloon would
lose<00:04:35.240> water<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.050> then<00:04:36.229> bunch<00:04:36.889> up<00:04:37.099> in<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
lose water and then bunch up in the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.670 
lose water and then bunch up in the
middle<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.820> those<00:04:38.449> chloroplasts<00:04:39.409> are<00:04:39.500> all

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
middle and those chloroplasts are all

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.540 
middle and those chloroplasts are all
stuck<00:04:40.659> inside<00:04:41.659> that<00:04:42.139> cell<00:04:42.710> membrane<00:04:45.159> so<00:04:46.159> this

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
stuck inside that cell membrane so this

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.689 
stuck inside that cell membrane so this
is<00:04:46.880> going<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.479> explain<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.930> little<00:04:48.169> bit<00:04:48.380> about

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
is going to explain a little bit about

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.399 
is going to explain a little bit about
what<00:04:49.699> you're<00:04:49.849> seeing<00:04:50.060> hmm<00:04:50.930> let's<00:04:51.139> say<00:04:51.289> that

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
what you're seeing hmm let's say that

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.129 
what you're seeing hmm let's say that
this<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.620> your<00:04:51.919> cell<00:04:52.270> this<00:04:53.270> outer<00:04:53.599> part<00:04:53.780> would

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
this is your cell this outer part would

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.620 
this is your cell this outer part would
be<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.380> cell<00:04:54.590> wall<00:04:54.860> okay<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.759> real<00:04:56.090> life<00:04:56.360> your

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
be the cell wall okay in real life your

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.080 
be the cell wall okay in real life your
cells<00:04:56.900> really<00:04:57.199> are<00:04:57.470> 3-dimensional<00:04:58.310> that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
cells really are 3-dimensional that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.290 
cells really are 3-dimensional that
you're<00:04:59.240> looking<00:04:59.539> at<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.900> lod<00:05:00.409> a<00:05:00.440> cells<00:05:01.300> they

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
you're looking at the lod a cells they

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.510 
you're looking at the lod a cells they
look<00:05:02.449> pretty<00:05:02.810> flat<00:05:03.199> on<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.560> microscope<00:05:04.130> but

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
look pretty flat on the microscope but

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.570 
look pretty flat on the microscope but
this<00:05:05.449> really<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.770> know<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:07.099> shape<00:05:07.370> of

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
this really is you know the shape of

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.909 
this really is you know the shape of
your<00:05:07.610> LOD<00:05:08.300> SL<00:05:08.659> and<00:05:10.479> when<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.810> cell<00:05:12.110> is<00:05:12.380> full<00:05:12.860> of

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
your LOD SL and when the cell is full of

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.930 
your LOD SL and when the cell is full of
water<00:05:14.320> if<00:05:15.320> we<00:05:15.620> could<00:05:15.830> look<00:05:16.009> inside<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
water if we could look inside of the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.110 
water if we could look inside of the
cell<00:05:17.360> we<00:05:17.690> would<00:05:17.870> see<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.460> indeed<00:05:19.990> there<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.320> a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
cell we would see that indeed there is a

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.960 
cell we would see that indeed there is a
membrane<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.740> cell<00:05:24.740> membrane<00:05:25.220> is<00:05:25.400> pressed<00:05:25.729> all

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
membrane a cell membrane is pressed all

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.870 
membrane a cell membrane is pressed all
the<00:05:26.419> way<00:05:26.539> up<00:05:26.810> against<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.620> edge<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.490> have<00:05:28.849> a

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
the way up against the edge so I have a

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.820 
the way up against the edge so I have a
water<00:05:29.240> balloon<00:05:29.479> in<00:05:29.750> here<00:05:30.080> that's

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
water balloon in here that's

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.170 
water balloon in here that's
representing<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:33.560> cell<00:05:33.770> membrane<00:05:34.250> pushing

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
representing the cell membrane pushing

I<00:05:48.480> were<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.750> put<00:05:49.020> this<00:05:49.200> cell<00:05:49.680> in<00:05:49.950> salt<00:05:50.790> water

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
I were to put this cell in salt water

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.070 
I were to put this cell in salt water
the<00:05:53.340> cell<00:05:53.550> itself<00:05:54.000> wouldn't<00:05:54.480> change<00:05:54.750> shape

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
the cell itself wouldn't change shape

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
the cell itself wouldn't change shape
you<00:05:55.740> know<00:05:55.860> it's<00:05:56.760> going<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.000> remain<00:05:57.360> this

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
you know it's going to remain this

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.180 
you know it's going to remain this
box-like<00:05:59.100> shape<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.990> it's<00:06:01.170> going<00:06:01.260> to<00:06:01.350> stay<00:06:01.590> 3d

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
box-like shape so it's going to stay 3d

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.000 
box-like shape so it's going to stay 3d
because<00:06:02.730> of<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.300> toughness<00:06:03.570> of<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.530> cell

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
because of the toughness of the cell

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:12.230 
because of the toughness of the cell
wall<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:08.280> if<00:06:08.550> we<00:06:09.300> look<00:06:09.480> inside<00:06:10.760> now<00:06:11.760> assuming

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
wall but if we look inside now assuming

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.380 
wall but if we look inside now assuming
that<00:06:12.300> we<00:06:12.600> put<00:06:13.410> this<00:06:13.590> cell<00:06:14.100> in<00:06:14.370> salt<00:06:14.790> water<00:06:15.060> the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
that we put this cell in salt water the

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.920 
that we put this cell in salt water the
cell<00:06:15.630> membrane<00:06:16.140> will<00:06:16.440> have<00:06:17.240> shrunken<00:06:18.240> in<00:06:18.480> a

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
cell membrane will have shrunken in a

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.310 
cell membrane will have shrunken in a
little<00:06:19.320> bit<00:06:19.790> so<00:06:20.790> it's<00:06:21.450> not<00:06:22.730> quite<00:06:23.730> up<00:06:24.320> against

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
little bit so it's not quite up against

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.630 
little bit so it's not quite up against
the<00:06:25.440> edge<00:06:25.760> it's<00:06:26.760> smaller<00:06:27.620> it<00:06:28.620> lost<00:06:29.010> some<00:06:29.370> water

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
the edge it's smaller it lost some water

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.670 
the edge it's smaller it lost some water
and<00:06:30.000> everything<00:06:30.510> that's<00:06:30.870> inside<00:06:31.050> of<00:06:31.320> it<00:06:31.500> would

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
and everything that's inside of it would

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.150 
and everything that's inside of it would
be<00:06:31.800> balled<00:06:32.100> up<00:06:32.370> on<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:33.000> inside<00:06:33.450> so<00:06:34.440> it<00:06:34.920> has

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
be balled up on the inside so it has

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.320 
be balled up on the inside so it has
shrunken<00:06:35.820> away<00:06:36.620> from<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:38.040> edges<00:06:38.700> of<00:06:38.970> our<00:06:39.390> cell

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
shrunken away from the edges of our cell

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.190 
shrunken away from the edges of our cell
so<00:06:42.330> when<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:42.990> cell<00:06:44.030> looks<00:06:45.030> like<00:06:45.270> this<00:06:45.630> this

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
so when the cell looks like this this

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.860 
so when the cell looks like this this
tells<00:06:46.500> us<00:06:46.740> that<00:06:47.100> water<00:06:47.580> has<00:06:47.850> moved<00:06:48.090> out<00:06:48.300> why

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
tells us that water has moved out why

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.470 
tells us that water has moved out why
did<00:06:49.110> it<00:06:49.230> move<00:06:49.410> out<00:06:49.850> there<00:06:50.850> was<00:06:51.090> a<00:06:51.120> higher

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
did it move out there was a higher

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.140 
did it move out there was a higher
concentration<00:06:51.930> of<00:06:52.680> water<00:06:52.890> on<00:06:53.250> the<00:06:53.430> inside<00:06:53.940> of

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
concentration of water on the inside of

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.620 
concentration of water on the inside of
this<00:06:54.300> cell<00:06:54.690> and<00:06:55.070> the<00:06:56.070> lower<00:06:56.630> concentration

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
this cell and the lower concentration

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.510 
this cell and the lower concentration
outside<00:06:57.840> of<00:06:58.590> the<00:06:58.740> cell<00:06:59.040> and<00:07:00.620> so<00:07:01.620> the<00:07:01.890> water<00:07:02.160> is

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
outside of the cell and so the water is

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.820 
outside of the cell and so the water is
going<00:07:02.760> to<00:07:03.060> move<00:07:03.300> from<00:07:03.720> high<00:07:04.020> to<00:07:04.080> low<00:07:04.380> that

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
going to move from high to low that

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.270 
going to move from high to low that
means<00:07:05.010> it's<00:07:05.220> moving<00:07:05.370> out<00:07:05.700> of<00:07:06.180> the<00:07:06.390> cell<00:07:06.660> and<00:07:07.280> as

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
means it's moving out of the cell and as

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.420 
means it's moving out of the cell and as
it<00:07:08.580> moves<00:07:08.820> out<00:07:09.000> of<00:07:09.090> the<00:07:09.330> cell<00:07:10.160> the<00:07:11.160> cell

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
it moves out of the cell the cell

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.450 
it moves out of the cell the cell
membrane<00:07:11.910> shrinks<00:07:12.690> into<00:07:12.900> the<00:07:13.410> middle<00:07:13.710> of<00:07:13.860> the

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
membrane shrinks into the middle of the

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.409 
membrane shrinks into the middle of the
cell<00:07:15.650> so<00:07:16.650> that<00:07:16.890> is<00:07:17.220> what<00:07:17.580> happens<00:07:17.940> when<00:07:18.120> we<00:07:18.210> put

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
cell so that is what happens when we put

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:23.540 
cell so that is what happens when we put
our<00:07:18.660> cell<00:07:19.050> into<00:07:19.830> salt<00:07:20.820> water<00:07:21.830> well<00:07:22.830> what<00:07:23.430> about

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
our cell into salt water well what about

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.030 
our cell into salt water well what about
when<00:07:23.910> it's<00:07:24.090> in<00:07:24.240> tap<00:07:24.480> water<00:07:24.560> when<00:07:25.560> it's<00:07:25.680> in<00:07:25.830> tap

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040 
when it's in tap water when it's in tap

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.860 
when it's in tap water when it's in tap
water<00:07:26.100> everything<00:07:26.790> is<00:07:26.910> pretty<00:07:27.090> much<00:07:27.180> balanced

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
water everything is pretty much balanced

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.980 
water everything is pretty much balanced
so<00:07:28.800> we<00:07:29.010> have<00:07:29.190> an<00:07:29.310> equal<00:07:29.700> amount<00:07:29.940> of<00:07:30.120> water

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
so we have an equal amount of water

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.070 
so we have an equal amount of water
inside<00:07:31.530> and<00:07:31.590> outside<00:07:31.890> the<00:07:32.160> cell<00:07:32.310> so<00:07:33.270> we<00:07:33.450> have<00:07:33.720> a

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
inside and outside the cell so we have a

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.760 
inside and outside the cell so we have a
state<00:07:34.560> of<00:07:34.770> balance<00:07:35.010> or<00:07:36.260> if<00:07:37.260> you<00:07:37.380> want<00:07:37.560> to<00:07:37.590> call

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
state of balance or if you want to call

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.110 
state of balance or if you want to call
it<00:07:37.980> osmotic<00:07:38.340> balance<00:07:39.590> so<00:07:40.590> that<00:07:40.620> is<00:07:41.250> your

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 
it osmotic balance so that is your

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.350 
it osmotic balance so that is your
Elodie<00:07:42.840> lesson<00:07:43.680> for<00:07:43.980> the<00:07:44.130> day
