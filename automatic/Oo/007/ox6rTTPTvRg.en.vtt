bicycles with a tip / product review for
you<00:00:17.830> most<00:00:18.830> cyclists<00:00:19.550> I<00:00:19.669> don't<00:00:20.060> know<00:00:20.240> if<00:00:20.390> they

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
you most cyclists I don't know if they

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.439 
you most cyclists I don't know if they
have<00:00:21.439> this<00:00:21.679> product<00:00:22.220> at<00:00:22.369> home<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:22.849> it<00:00:22.999> really

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
have this product at home but it really

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.109 
have this product at home but it really
should<00:00:23.839> be<00:00:24.019> an<00:00:24.169> integral<00:00:24.560> part<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.249> having<00:00:25.880> a

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
should be an integral part of having a

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.689 
should be an integral part of having a
bicycle<00:00:26.470> most<00:00:27.470> bikes<00:00:27.769> even<00:00:28.039> if<00:00:28.249> you<00:00:28.369> don't

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
bicycle most bikes even if you don't

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.210 
bicycle most bikes even if you don't
have<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:28.999> flat<00:00:29.419> tire<00:00:29.749> your<00:00:30.169> tires<00:00:30.499> will<00:00:30.919> bleed

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
have a flat tire your tires will bleed

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.299 
have a flat tire your tires will bleed
off<00:00:31.400> air<00:00:31.730> or<00:00:31.939> lose<00:00:32.300> air<00:00:32.660> pressure<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:34.250> is

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
off air or lose air pressure and that is

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.420 
off air or lose air pressure and that is
the<00:00:34.850> single<00:00:35.420> most<00:00:35.620> important<00:00:36.620> performance

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
the single most important performance

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.790 
the single most important performance
thing<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:38.510> can<00:00:38.719> do<00:00:38.870> for<00:00:39.109> your<00:00:39.199> bike<00:00:39.379> is<00:00:39.590> make

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
thing you can do for your bike is make

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.950 
thing you can do for your bike is make
sure<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.250> your<00:00:40.460> tires<00:00:41.180> are<00:00:41.510> maintaining

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
sure that your tires are maintaining

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.869 
sure that your tires are maintaining
their<00:00:42.170> proper<00:00:42.559> air<00:00:42.710> pressure<00:00:42.739> I<00:00:43.370> know<00:00:43.699> you

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
their proper air pressure I know you

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.000 
their proper air pressure I know you
hear<00:00:44.149> that<00:00:44.269> for<00:00:44.539> cars<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.079> fuel<00:00:45.230> efficiency

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
hear that for cars and fuel efficiency

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.979 
hear that for cars and fuel efficiency
but<00:00:46.190> on<00:00:46.309> a<00:00:46.340> bicycle<00:00:46.640> it<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.269> very<00:00:47.629> critical

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
but on a bicycle it is very critical

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.750 
but on a bicycle it is very critical
that<00:00:48.260> your<00:00:48.559> tires<00:00:48.890> are<00:00:49.219> at<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.429> right<00:00:49.579> air

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
that your tires are at the right air

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.270 
that your tires are at the right air
pressure<00:00:50.059> not<00:00:50.960> only<00:00:51.230> for<00:00:51.469> performance<00:00:52.100> so

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
pressure not only for performance so

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.400 
pressure not only for performance so
that<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.519> go<00:00:52.699> further<00:00:53.059> farther<00:00:53.539> faster<00:00:53.839> but

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
that you go further farther faster but

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.950 
that you go further farther faster but
to<00:00:54.800> protect<00:00:55.190> your<00:00:55.429> rims<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.089> to<00:00:56.600> keep<00:00:56.780> from

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
to protect your rims and to keep from

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.950 
to protect your rims and to keep from
getting<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.350> flat<00:00:57.620> tire<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:59.359> product<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.899> would

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
getting a flat tire the product I would

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.319 
getting a flat tire the product I would
recommend<00:01:00.589> would<00:01:00.890> be<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:01.100> floor<00:01:01.640> pump<00:01:01.910> with<00:01:02.300> a

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
recommend would be a floor pump with a

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.530 
recommend would be a floor pump with a
built<00:01:02.719> in<00:01:02.899> gauge<00:01:03.400> again<00:01:04.400> this<00:01:04.699> way<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:04.970> know

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
built in gauge again this way you know

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.719 
built in gauge again this way you know
exactly<00:01:06.259> how<00:01:06.500> much<00:01:06.680> air<00:01:06.920> pressure<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.430> are

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
exactly how much air pressure you are

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.080 
exactly how much air pressure you are
putting<00:01:07.939> into<00:01:08.240> your<00:01:08.450> tires<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:10.220> can<00:01:10.400> see<00:01:10.700> from

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
putting into your tires you can see from

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.990 
putting into your tires you can see from
this<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.570> easy<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.200> read<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:13.130> can<00:01:13.340> even<00:01:13.490> mark

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
this it's easy to read you can even mark

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.389 
this it's easy to read you can even mark
with<00:01:14.299> this<00:01:14.479> little<00:01:14.810> red<00:01:14.990> arrow<00:01:15.350> exactly<00:01:16.220> what

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
with this little red arrow exactly what

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.730 
with this little red arrow exactly what
air<00:01:16.579> pressure<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.060> want<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.509> go<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.530> when

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
air pressure you want to go to so when

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.649 
air pressure you want to go to so when
the<00:01:18.860> needle<00:01:19.159> gets<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.390> know<00:01:20.600> you

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
the needle gets to that you know you

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.340 
the needle gets to that you know you
don't<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.380> squint<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:21.920> look<00:01:23.200> but<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
don't have to squint and look but the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.960 
don't have to squint and look but the
advantage<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:24.950> having<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.310> floor<00:01:25.549> pump<00:01:25.790> like

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
advantage of having a floor pump like

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.030 
advantage of having a floor pump like
this<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.689> easy<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.380> check<00:01:27.799> your

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
this is that it is easy to check your

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.760 
this is that it is easy to check your
pressure<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.869> maintain<00:01:29.869> them<00:01:30.140> at<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.380> proper

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
pressure and maintain them at the proper

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.179 
pressure and maintain them at the proper
air<00:01:30.950> pressure<00:01:31.210> most<00:01:32.210> floor<00:01:32.540> pumps<00:01:32.990> similar<00:01:33.979> to

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
air pressure most floor pumps similar to
