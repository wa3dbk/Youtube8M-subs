00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
Lescott which is just crazy how the hell

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
did he manage to be in the box like that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.880 
did he manage to be in the box like that
and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> away<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.710> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and then put it away that is just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.679 
and then put it away that is just
ridiculous<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> things<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> like

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
ridiculous but one of the things I like

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
ridiculous but one of the things I like
to<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> goal-kick<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:59.219> we're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to do is for a goal-kick if we're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.649 
to do is for a goal-kick if we're
playing<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> counter<00:02:00.240> attacking<00:02:00.420> football

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
playing the counter attacking football

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.870 
playing the counter attacking football
is<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.049> boot<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.799> field<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.369> quickly<00:02:02.640> as

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
is just boot it up field as quickly as

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670 
is just boot it up field as quickly as
possible<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.869> sometimes<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.409> beat<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
possible but sometimes you can beat the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
possible but sometimes you can beat the
slow<00:02:04.829> defenders<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.369> Joleon<00:02:05.880> Lescott<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.420> i

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
slow defenders like Joleon Lescott and i

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
slow defenders like Joleon Lescott and i
think<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.710> argentinian<00:02:08.369> on

stood way offside there and that is
that's<00:04:36.130> pretty<00:04:36.280> much<00:04:36.460> Holly's<00:04:36.760> gonna<00:04:36.880> get<00:04:37.030> to

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
that's pretty much Holly's gonna get to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.910 
that's pretty much Holly's gonna get to
do<00:04:37.240> because<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.780> think<00:04:38.020> he's<00:04:38.170> going<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.860> be

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
do because I think he's going to be

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.520 
do because I think he's going to be
going<00:04:39.280> on<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.730> wing<00:04:40.060> now<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.540> on<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.380> wing

going on to the wing now and on the wing

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.690 
going on to the wing now and on the wing
I<00:04:41.650> don't<00:04:41.770> think<00:04:41.890> he<00:04:41.950> would<00:04:42.040> do<00:04:42.160> very<00:04:42.190> much<00:04:42.490> but

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
I don't think he would do very much but

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.950 
I don't think he would do very much but

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
diving header from Olson I think that

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.190

wasn't<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.330> was<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.480> defender<00:05:04.840> from<00:05:04.960> West

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
Brom scores an own goal and it was an

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.210 
Brom scores an own goal and it was an
absolute<00:05:07.660> screamer<00:05:07.840> when<00:05:08.170> I'm<00:05:08.260> gone<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:09.130> was

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.430 
absolute screamer when I'm gone that was
a<00:05:09.250> crazy<00:05:09.580> good<00:05:09.850> on<00:05:10.030> god<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.240> wish<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.990> we<00:05:11.290> could
