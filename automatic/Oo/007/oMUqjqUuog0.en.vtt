my<00:00:13.949> family<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.420> ranching<00:00:15.869> for<00:00:16.080> years<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:16.759 
my family was in ranching for years and

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.669 
my family was in ranching for years and
yet<00:00:17.759> by<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.939> time<00:00:18.300> Ken<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.869> decided<00:00:19.259> to<00:00:19.410> own

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:19.679 
yet by the time Ken and I decided to own

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.279 
yet by the time Ken and I decided to own
bison<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.669> the<00:00:21.449> ranching<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:21.990> done

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
bison you know the ranching was done

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960 
bison you know the ranching was done
there<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.980> no<00:00:23.160> connection<00:00:23.429> to<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.820> land

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
there was no connection to the land

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.700 
there was no connection to the land
because<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.599> ranch<00:00:24.779> had<00:00:24.960> been<00:00:25.109> sold<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.589> we

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
because the ranch had been sold so we

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.890 
because the ranch had been sold so we
started<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.220> scratch<00:00:26.539> when<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.659> first

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
started from scratch when we first

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.089 
started from scratch when we first
started<00:00:28.230> off<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.589> was<00:00:28.710> pretty<00:00:28.859> much<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
started off it was pretty much a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.729 
started off it was pretty much a
business<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:31.050> knew<00:00:31.169> that<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.409> love<00:00:31.589> the

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
business and we we knew that we love the

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.900 
business and we we knew that we love the
meat<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.220> we<00:00:32.310> didn't<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.730> much<00:00:32.850> about

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
meat but we didn't know that much about

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.630 
meat but we didn't know that much about
the<00:00:33.239> animals<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.620> after<00:00:34.950> we've<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.430> we've

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the animals but after we've now we've

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.150 
the animals but after we've now we've
owned<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> animals<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.870> 12<00:00:37.470> years<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
owned the animals for about 12 years and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.800 
owned the animals for about 12 years and
it<00:00:38.640> seems<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.630> spend

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
it seems that the more time we spend

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.260 
it seems that the more time we spend
with<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:40.470> amazed<00:00:40.830> we<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.970> how

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
with them the more amazed we are at how

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
with them the more amazed we are at how
intelligent<00:00:42.930> they<00:00:42.990> are<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.470> how<00:00:43.560> spirited

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
intelligent they are and how spirited

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.640 
intelligent they are and how spirited
they<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:46.050> more<00:00:46.080> time<00:00:46.470> you<00:00:46.620> spend

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
they are and the more time you spend

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.590 
they are and the more time you spend
with<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> better<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.580> gets<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.480> know

with them the better it gets you know
the<00:00:48.780> most<00:00:49.020> important<00:00:49.740> practices<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.520> focus<00:00:50.970> on

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the most important practices we focus on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
the most important practices we focus on
in<00:00:51.540> raising<00:00:52.440> our<00:00:52.560> grass<00:00:52.770> fed<00:00:53.010> bison<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
in raising our grass fed bison is just a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.530 
in raising our grass fed bison is just a
hands-off<00:00:54.930> approach<00:00:55.580> their<00:00:56.580> wild<00:00:57.060> creatures

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
hands-off approach their wild creatures

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.050 
hands-off approach their wild creatures
they<00:00:58.290> do<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.830> fine<00:00:59.070> without<00:00:59.400> any<00:00:59.790> help<00:00:59.970> from

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.100 
they do just fine without any help from
us<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.410> provide<00:01:01.830> grass<00:01:02.240> we<00:01:03.240> let<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.720> family

satisfying<00:02:08.789> thing<00:02:09.060> about<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.539> we're<00:02:09.689> doing

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
satisfying thing about what we're doing

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.600 
satisfying thing about what we're doing
is<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.409> we<00:02:10.470> are<00:02:10.679> building<00:02:10.920> something<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
is that we are building something of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.290 
is that we are building something of
value

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
value

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.080 
value
that<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.530> controlled<00:02:14.100> by<00:02:14.280> somebody<00:02:15.000> else

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
that is not controlled by somebody else

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
that is not controlled by somebody else
that<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.960> something<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.440> we<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.860> for

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
that is something that we can do for

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.050 
that is something that we can do for
ourselves<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.810> our<00:02:18.900> own<00:02:19.110> fashion<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.060> we

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
ourselves and in our own fashion and we

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.730 
ourselves and in our own fashion and we
really<00:02:21.360> believe<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> effort

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
really believe that all of the effort

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.040 
really believe that all of the effort
that<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.520> takes<00:02:23.670> place<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.390> it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
that that it takes place to do this it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.380 
that that it takes place to do this it's
nice<00:02:25.350> after<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.310> wife<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.760> had<00:02:26.880> spent<00:02:27.030> some
