and<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.110> have<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> little<00:02:45.560> bit<00:02:45.650> more<00:02:45.800> down<00:02:45.980> here

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
and I have a little bit more down here

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.310 
and I have a little bit more down here
when<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.340> first<00:02:46.670> did<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:46.970> not<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:47.540> nice<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:50.320> yeah

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
when I first did it not as nice but yeah

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.840 
when I first did it not as nice but yeah
guys<00:02:51.500> that's<00:02:51.680> how<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.950> make<00:02:52.190> holes<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.640> your

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
guys that's how you make holes in your

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.190 
guys that's how you make holes in your
tubs<00:02:53.780> or<00:02:54.620> whatever<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.610> wanna<00:02:55.730> call<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:56.200> using

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
tubs or whatever you wanna call it using

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.130 
tubs or whatever you wanna call it using
a<00:02:57.290> soldering<00:02:57.680> iron<00:02:58.480> make<00:02:59.480> sure<00:02:59.630> it's<00:02:59.780> nice<00:02:59.900> and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
a soldering iron make sure it's nice and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.170 
a soldering iron make sure it's nice and
hot<00:03:00.290> my<00:03:00.620> smoke<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> little<00:03:01.340> bit<00:03:01.459> cuz<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.700> plastic

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
hot my smoke a little bit cuz of plastic

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.410 
hot my smoke a little bit cuz of plastic
try<00:03:02.420> not<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.690> breathe<00:03:02.900> as<00:03:03.019> much<00:03:03.050> as<00:03:03.350> in<00:03:03.650> but

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
try not to breathe as much as in but

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.420 
try not to breathe as much as in but
that's<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.480> very<00:03:05.720> easy<00:03:05.900> way<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.440> guess<00:03:07.160> if<00:03:07.340> we

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
that's a very easy way I guess if we

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
that's a very easy way I guess if we
want<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.730> use<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.880> drill<00:03:08.299> way<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:09.560> can<00:03:09.709> go<00:03:09.860> ahead

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
want to use a drill way you can go ahead

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.270 
want to use a drill way you can go ahead
and<00:03:10.400> uh<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:11.080> think<00:03:12.080> they<00:03:12.200> lay<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.799> out<00:03:12.980> like<00:03:13.100> a

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
and uh I think they lay it out like a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.850 
and uh I think they lay it out like a
template<00:03:13.730> I've<00:03:14.690> liked<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.110> pattern<00:03:15.380> or<00:03:15.769> how

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
template I've liked the pattern or how

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.030 
template I've liked the pattern or how
many<00:03:16.070> holes<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.459> want<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.940> your<00:03:17.380> your<00:03:18.380> tub<00:03:18.650> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
many holes you want in your your tub and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.220 
many holes you want in your your tub and
then<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.370> run<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.820> along<00:03:19.970> right<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
then just run it along right here and

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.850 
then just run it along right here and
start<00:03:22.040> from<00:03:22.160> smaller<00:03:22.549> size<00:03:22.880> drill<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.860> drill

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
start from smaller size drill in drill

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.860 
start from smaller size drill in drill
all<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.130> holes<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.880> then<00:03:26.329> it'll<00:03:26.570> go<00:03:26.720> from

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
all the holes in and then it'll go from

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.280 
all the holes in and then it'll go from
the<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.380> then<00:03:27.500> go<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.370> bigger<00:03:28.610> size<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:30.110> they

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
the and then go to a bigger size so they

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.170 
the and then go to a bigger size so they
won't<00:03:30.470> crack<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.890> tub<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.430> know<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.030> way

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
won't crack the tub you know that way

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.720 
won't crack the tub you know that way
but<00:03:32.840> yeah<00:03:33.260> guys<00:03:33.410> that's<00:03:33.620> how<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:33.890> do<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.459> hole

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730
