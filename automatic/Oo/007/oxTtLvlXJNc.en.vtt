00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
free way of how to do it you at first

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.960 
free way of how to do it you at first
need<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> make<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.750> folder<00:00:16.160> in<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.340> case<00:00:17.640> I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
need to make the folder in this case I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630 
need to make the folder in this case I
would<00:00:18.150> make<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.189> leave<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.520> as

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
would make it I just leave it as

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.170 
would make it I just leave it as
untitled<00:00:21.300> folder<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.100> then<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.400> would<00:00:23.820> go<00:00:24.150> to

the<00:00:49.410> first<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.340> recommended<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the first one is recommended but it's

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.040 
the first one is recommended but it's
not<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.379> secure<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> second<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
not as secure as the second one the the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
not as secure as the second one the the
second<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> slower<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.850> that's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
second one is slower that's and that's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.130 
second one is slower that's and that's
more<00:00:57.750> secure<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> second<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
more secure I use the second one so that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.470 
more secure I use the second one so that
need<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> click<00:01:01.559> save<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> takes<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> few

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
need to click save and it takes a few

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.260 
need to click save and it takes a few
seconds<00:01:04.080> they'll<00:01:04.229> ask<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> password

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.120

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.699 
utility you can't edit the folder once
you<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.149> disk<00:02:09.390> image<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:10.440> for

you make it a disk image like for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.350 
you make it a disk image like for
example<00:02:11.190> if<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.610> want<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.910> put<00:02:12.569> my<00:02:12.989> desk

folder cannot be modified so there you
there's<00:02:24.820> another<00:02:25.150> way<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.660> doing<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.110> that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
there's another way of doing it that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740 
there's another way of doing it that
costs<00:02:26.770> money<00:02:26.980> which<00:02:27.280> allows<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.270> modify

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
costs money which allows you to modify

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.860 
costs money which allows you to modify
it<00:02:28.960> but<00:02:29.740> it's<00:02:29.890> not<00:02:30.040> as<00:02:30.250> secure<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.390> use<00:02:31.630> both

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
it but it's not as secure but I use both

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.610 
it but it's not as secure but I use both
of<00:02:31.930> them<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.410> one<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.540> called<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.960> pmax

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
of them in one so it's called a pmax
