00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
they made the mistake on on to the game

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
and thus they start to hate the game and
then<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.009> don't<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> play<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.880> anymore

then they don't want to play it anymore

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
then they don't want to play it anymore
it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.930> nice<00:01:31.200> vicious<00:01:31.829> cycle<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.310> we've

on<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.280> 3<00:03:45.550> bar<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.910> bit<00:03:46.209> ridiculous<00:03:46.330> in<00:03:46.870> this

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
on a 3 bar is a bit ridiculous in this

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.050 
on a 3 bar is a bit ridiculous in this
game<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.350> seems<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.800> lot<00:03:48.010> worse<00:03:48.400> than<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:49.030> did

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
game it seems a lot worse than it did

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.699

another<00:03:49.360> call<00:03:49.660> duties<00:03:50.050> but<00:03:50.230> that's<00:03:50.440> just

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
another call duties but that's just

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.890 
another call duties but that's just
because<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.340> have<00:03:51.489> less<00:03:51.730> time<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.120> make<00:03:52.570> up<00:03:52.600> to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
because you have less time to make up to

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.680 
because you have less time to make up to
the<00:03:53.019> lag<00:03:53.230> because<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.160> guns<00:03:54.370> kill<00:03:54.640> faster<00:03:54.940> so

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
the lag because the guns kill faster so

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.240 
the lag because the guns kill faster so
let's<00:03:55.870> talk<00:03:56.050> about<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.560> why<00:03:57.100> are<00:03:57.160> you

winning so whether you're at a 3 bar or
2<00:04:40.190> bar<00:04:40.430> or<00:04:40.730> whatever<00:04:41.300> you're<00:04:41.930> gonna<00:04:42.020> have

roughly the same equal chance of killing
the<00:04:45.530> person<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.340> might<00:04:46.640> think<00:04:46.850> that's

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
the person so you might think that's

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.790 
the person so you might think that's
unfair<00:04:47.240> but<00:04:47.660> that's<00:04:47.870> kind<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.410> something<00:04:48.680> that

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
unfair but that's kind of something that

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.710 
unfair but that's kind of something that
will<00:04:49.040> never<00:04:49.190> change<00:04:49.310> because<00:04:50.030> without<00:04:50.510> it

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
will never change because without it

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.630 
will never change because without it
half<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.500> world's<00:04:51.800> population<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.460> place

half the world's population the place
call<00:04:52.850> duty<00:04:53.060> would<00:04:53.270> kill<00:04:53.600> themselves<00:04:54.080> because

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
call duty would kill themselves because

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.250 
call duty would kill themselves because
they<00:04:54.800> can't<00:04:55.040> get<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.220> kill<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:56.210> don't<00:04:56.930> get<00:04:57.200> mad

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
they can't get a kill so don't get mad

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.800 
they can't get a kill so don't get mad
at<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.920> stuff<00:04:57.980> that<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.880> cannot<00:04:59.330> physically

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
at the stuff that you cannot physically

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.140 
at the stuff that you cannot physically
change<00:05:00.230> instead<00:05:00.950> work<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.340> your<00:05:01.580> game<00:05:01.610> play

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
change instead work on your game play

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.460 
change instead work on your game play
because<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.780> guarantee<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:03.200> there<00:05:03.350> was

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
because I guarantee you there was

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.560 
because I guarantee you there was
something<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:03.890> could<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.460> done<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:05.000> kill

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
something you could have done to kill

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.690 
something you could have done to kill
that<00:05:05.750> guy<00:05:05.960> even<00:05:06.590> though<00:05:06.680> you're<00:05:06.860> on<00:05:06.950> 33<00:05:07.460> bar

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
that guy even though you're on 33 bar

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.730 
that guy even though you're on 33 bar
maybe<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.330> saw<00:05:08.510> on<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.750> UAV<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:09.230> you<00:05:09.380> decided

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
maybe you saw on the UAV and you decided

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.200 
maybe you saw on the UAV and you decided
to<00:05:09.830> rush<00:05:10.070> around<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.400> corner<00:05:10.700> jump<00:05:10.970> around

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
to rush around the corner jump around

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.030 
to rush around the corner jump around
like<00:05:11.270> kangaroo<00:05:11.720> jack<00:05:11.990> play<00:05:12.200> some<00:05:12.410> halo<00:05:12.590> and

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
like kangaroo jack play some halo and

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.130 
like kangaroo jack play some halo and
try<00:05:13.730> and<00:05:13.790> get<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.060> head<00:05:14.300> shot<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.930> didn't

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
try and get a head shot and it didn't

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.840 
try and get a head shot and it didn't
work<00:05:15.170> out<00:05:15.440> for<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.770> maybe<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:16.580> should<00:05:16.610> have

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
work out for you maybe you should have

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.520 
work out for you maybe you should have
just<00:05:17.000> waited<00:05:17.270> until<00:05:17.660> he<00:05:17.840> walked<00:05:18.200> around<00:05:18.410> the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
just waited until he walked around the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.860 
just waited until he walked around the
corner<00:05:18.800> or<00:05:18.980> took<00:05:19.430> in<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.640> different<00:05:20.000> route<00:05:20.240> so

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
corner or took in a different route so

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.420 
corner or took in a different route so
you<00:05:20.960> see<00:05:21.230> there<00:05:21.440> are<00:05:21.620> certain<00:05:22.070> things<00:05:22.250> that

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
you see there are certain things that

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.070 
you see there are certain things that
you<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.760> always<00:05:23.150> improve<00:05:23.330> on<00:05:23.690> with<00:05:23.840> your<00:05:23.960> own

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
improve ridiculous amounts i went from

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.770 
improve ridiculous amounts i went from
going<00:05:30.410> negative<00:05:30.950> point<00:05:31.490> 5<00:05:31.730> kt<00:05:32.000> every<00:05:32.450> game<00:05:32.630> at

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
going negative point 5 kt every game at

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.380 
going negative point 5 kt every game at
the<00:05:32.870> start<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.620> my<00:05:33.650> last<00:05:34.070> session<00:05:34.520> where<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:34.970> led

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
the start to my last session where I led

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.660 
the start to my last session where I led
the<00:05:35.540> team<00:05:35.750> every<00:05:36.350> game<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:37.160> literally

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
the team every game and I literally

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.870 
the team every game and I literally
destroyed<00:05:38.360> faces<00:05:39.320> faces<00:05:39.770> were<00:05:40.070> destroyed<00:05:40.610> in

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
destroyed faces faces were destroyed in

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.150 
destroyed faces faces were destroyed in
my<00:05:41.120> shift<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:42.410> reason<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.770> I've<00:05:42.980> been

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
my shift and the reason that I've been

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.890 
my shift and the reason that I've been
improving<00:05:43.760> so<00:05:43.970> much<00:05:44.120> is<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.270> I've<00:05:44.450> realized

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
improving so much is that I've realized

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.590 
improving so much is that I've realized
that<00:05:45.170> you<00:05:45.590> don't<00:05:45.620> play<00:05:46.580> as<00:05:46.910> aggressively<00:05:47.420> in

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
that you don't play as aggressively in

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.480 
that you don't play as aggressively in
this<00:05:47.720> game<00:05:47.930> yeah<00:05:48.440> you<00:05:48.500> can<00:05:48.800> rush<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.220> do<00:05:49.310> well

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
this game yeah you can rush and do well
