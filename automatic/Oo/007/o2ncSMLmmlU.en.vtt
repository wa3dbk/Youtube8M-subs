00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and I felt 21 good video is today les 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 I bring what would be a recommendation of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 Anime like every Monday and well this 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 anime are my top 10 although yes of that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.730
 before all this starts since 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.650
 Well, I always say that there must be 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.770
 anime is a little different not only the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.020
 same style in your top 10 and this one after 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.449
 very different from all those that I have this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.289
 is an email that is of its genres are 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.840
 comedy sports drama and zone and good 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.470
 this is football 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.900
 of course it's me so it has the drama 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.790
 more and has an interesting drama that if 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.190
 see the plans three chapters is going to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.220
 grab I think it happens 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.129
 good this anime are 37 episodes its 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.890
 first season and do not need very 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 famous but good I have not seen that many 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.670
 they do not mention and well it narrates the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 story from here I want aizawa a young 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.940
 prodigy of football that has the post 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.949
 of captain on the school team 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350
 kamakura 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.530
 his talent is such and already part of the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.020
 Japanese U-15 team in change their 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 brother sure leaves a lot to be desired with 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 footballer until one day things 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.370
 that things for sure change for 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.060
 always after an unfortunate accident 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.820
 Well it's called ariano keys and gentleman 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.300
 of the area 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.300
 it's football has if you have romance the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.280
 true then it gets very interesting 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.310
 when the arrival of different 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.850
 characters among other things good I think 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.550
 that there is a lot of manga this month and it started 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.550
 aired again but they do not pass it on 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.150
 Spanish because I have no idea but that 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.710
 It's only in English but I think it is 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.850
 so a part of him still 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 The friend is missing a lot today from having a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 single season easily because bush not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.440
 not you have better for a series 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.649
 of the same chapters of 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.869
 supercampeones clear that here not good 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.450
 if there are parts that lengthen it much but 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.370
 not the most and the dance very good the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.920
 drama is excellent has the job 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.300
 contains everything necessary for a good 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.330
 anime by areas 10 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.960
 and without more than anyone from this player 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.950
 that after an unfortunate accident 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.780
 start with soccer you will see what wave 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.690
 and well you will see because the hatred that 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.970
 it gets very interesting with this from the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.780
 accident and all that but good that's 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 all study to the unanimous vote of the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.620
 animes that are going to be the following 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.030
 season in January and he asked me for a 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.370
 century person reads but for while 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.540
 this one is going to be like at 5 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.910
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.390
 so like commented on twitter I do not know 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390
 feel
