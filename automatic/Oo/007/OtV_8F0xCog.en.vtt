00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello I have the first for you today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.290
 video of my back to school in turn though 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.389
 i'll show you three healthy easy and 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 very fast we are perfect with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
 can take the schools or that one 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.230
 it's too bad to have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.000
 is unhealthy or accidental and say 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.510
 same with the first court and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 Although it is a popular bagel and the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.810
 I have along with multivitamin juice 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 and grapes indeed as mini quasi 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 packed and brought for first 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.380
 a bagel you just cut on 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.110
 and then you take one 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.879
 avocado and mine was a bit had 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 that's why she has already packed but 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.809
 Of course I will have that in the end 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 omitted and the cuts ye 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.800
 small and then you can already 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.520
 with start on avocado on the buggles 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200
 down 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 Of course you can take so much 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.100
 As you like I like avocado very much 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 But I did not understand the whole thing 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.430
 but about a half and the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 the other half I have with 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.469
 fresh cheese painted because the whole 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.390
 but it would be a bit dry if you 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.799
 just take the roads and around the whole 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 I still have to top it off a bit 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.700
 basil leaves and the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.229
 whole seasoned with salt and pepper and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.790
 Already I was able to recover 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.850
 fold up and through the cream cheese 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 he keeps it good for me, too 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.049
 He makes sure that he does not work that way 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.060
 a lot of dirt and that's what I have 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.250
 then just plain normal grapes in 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.110
 a tupper can participated before 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.299
 washed and how flat she says 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 to my multivitamin juice in love 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.380
 I really like this little crash 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 It's perfect for school because it's me 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.579
 too much and not too little and yes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.189
 if it actually even so the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.189
 first correctly it says it makes a lot of sense 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.020
 and get directly to the second smells 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.479
 I'll show you a bit of herbert 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.720
 a sweet and healthy variation and that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.729
 It is this peanut butter sandwich and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.390
 a whole so delicious and then needs 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.979
 you just first two toast toast 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.790
 You can choose if he wants that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.190
 white takes 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.260
 the brown around the whole a bit 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.910
 to make healthier and distribute it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.110
 I must inherit then that is one 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.240
 Bit healthier than the first component 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.190
 Of course, you can also take some butter 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.929
 and then I put it together 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.850
 pressed blueberries through the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.800
 they are simply flatter 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.080
 and keep better on the natural gas needs 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.790
 and that's the whole thing I have then 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.220
 both sides with airbus must be deleted 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.140
 so that it is too dry and flip the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.030
 Both then help each other 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.320
 What I did then is that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.160
 to cut through all in the middle 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.420
 so just a little better in the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.270
 box just fit a bit 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.330
 is more manageable and I wanted to do so 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.680
 also a sweet variant of it 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.820
 I just have some nuts 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 taken was a now 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.660
 student food so a nut mixture 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.459
 and then I have you in a small one 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.260
 dose done next and then I 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.510
 only considered whether I should take it 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.160
 But I thought one apple would 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.180
 round off the whole a bit better 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.250
 That's why I have a little one 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.750
 Appell with in the dose done and to 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.940
 I'll take a bottle then 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.110
 neatly he says he has the same size 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.910
 like the multivitamin juice and is third 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.040
 court is pretty much the easiest 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.470
 you just need a part of it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.630
 newport a bit fast in the feed 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.910
 and blueberries and the whole I have 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.130
 then enter together in one dose 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.140
 that's not difficult actually 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.180
 animal would need no instructions but that 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.130
 a quick and easy school 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.190
 Lunch is I show you that and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.100
 they just have a little bit of fun here 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.810
 crunch cereal to the yogurt simply 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.940
 with in the box done together with 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.620
 blueberries and student food and then 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 Of course you can put the yogurt in the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.330
 can tilt and, so to speak, with the whole 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.700
 mix other stuff or first 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.989
 comes in as it pleases and it 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.519
 tastes really great too 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.830
 delicious and is perfect if you are 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.019
 no time in the morning and have to 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.800
 I just a bit yes what he did 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.860
 packed because I'm on the day 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.980
 great creative and yes that is 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.450
 actually already my three 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.820
 lunch and then I'm right in 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.520
 Eaten connection and he is so delicious 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.010

 what could make you so fit in the school 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.000
 I could take care of everyone 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.680
 often eat in the school 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.870
