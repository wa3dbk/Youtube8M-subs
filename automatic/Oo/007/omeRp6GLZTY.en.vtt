00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.510 
but I'm sure everybody's got a a
different<00:05:43.830> way<00:05:43.919> of<00:05:43.949> doing<00:05:44.129> it<00:05:44.340> this<00:05:44.460> is

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
different way of doing it this is

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.700 
different way of doing it this is
definitely<00:05:44.819> not<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.210> only<00:05:45.569> way<00:05:45.719> so<00:05:45.779> try<00:05:46.680> not

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
definitely not the only way so try not

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.550 
definitely not the only way so try not
to<00:05:46.860> get<00:05:47.340> wrapped<00:05:47.610> around<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.909> axle<00:05:48.000> on<00:05:48.560> you

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
to get wrapped around the axle on you

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.439 
to get wrapped around the axle on you
know<00:05:49.680> where<00:05:50.099> my<00:05:50.250> e<00:05:50.279> tool<00:05:50.639> is<00:05:50.909> or<00:05:51.150> something
