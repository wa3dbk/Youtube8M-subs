00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.510 
work worried the river otters are going
to<00:02:28.360> hurt<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.480> bass<00:02:29.690> population<00:02:30.350> oh<00:02:30.560> yeah<00:02:31.340> they

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
to hurt the bass population oh yeah they

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.940 
to hurt the bass population oh yeah they
will<00:02:31.670> are<00:02:32.540> they'll<00:02:32.780> wipe<00:02:32.930> make<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.470> wipe<00:02:33.770> out

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
will are they'll wipe make a wipe out

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.160 
will are they'll wipe make a wipe out
upon<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.550> they'll<00:02:34.670> move<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.850> another<00:02:35.180> one<00:02:35.360> so

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
upon and they'll move to another one so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.390 
upon and they'll move to another one so

must<00:03:03.140> die<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.930> know<00:03:06.020> Craig<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.320> lot<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.650> times

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
must die you know Craig a lot of times

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.700 
must die you know Craig a lot of times
guys<00:03:07.750> when<00:03:08.750> they<00:03:08.840> fish<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.050> place<00:03:09.320> like<00:03:09.530> this

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
guys when they fish a place like this

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.920 
guys when they fish a place like this
don't<00:03:09.950> necessarily<00:03:10.640> think<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.780> need

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
don't necessarily think that you need

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.510 
don't necessarily think that you need
electronics<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.680> think<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.040> really<00:03:13.250> small

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
electronics I think it's a really small

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.250 
electronics I think it's a really small
body<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.880> water<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.270> there's<00:03:14.420> really<00:03:14.630> no<00:03:15.020> use

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
body of water and there's really no use

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.980 
body of water and there's really no use
in<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:16.460> when<00:03:17.270> you've<00:03:17.390> got<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> place<00:03:17.810> like

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
in it but when you've got a place like

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.680 
in it but when you've got a place like
this<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.530> there<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.250> limited<00:03:19.820> structural

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
this and there is limited structural

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.900 
this and there is limited structural
changes<00:03:21.170> or<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:22.310> know<00:03:22.400> you've<00:03:22.550> got<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> lot<00:03:22.880> of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
changes or you know you've got a lot of

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.520 
changes or you know you've got a lot of
Bank<00:03:23.210> cover<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:23.690> obviously<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.260> fish<00:03:24.440> are

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
Bank cover but obviously the fish are

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.320 
Bank cover but obviously the fish are
going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.709> winter<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.040> deeper<00:03:25.400> water<00:03:25.610> it's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
going to winter in deeper water it's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.570 
going to winter in deeper water it's
great<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.750> take<00:03:26.959> some<00:03:27.290> quality<00:03:27.950> electronics

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
great to take some quality electronics

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.440 
great to take some quality electronics
and<00:03:29.920> kind<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.010> survey<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.640> area<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.360> I've

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
and kind of survey the area and so I've

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.910 
and kind of survey the area and so I've
drifted<00:03:32.660> down<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.020> Bank<00:03:33.290> three<00:03:33.620> or<00:03:33.770> four

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
drifted down this Bank three or four

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.920 
drifted down this Bank three or four
times<00:03:34.100> with<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.940> wind<00:03:35.180> plinking<00:03:35.600> up<00:03:35.690> against

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
times with the wind plinking up against

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.600 
times with the wind plinking up against
the<00:03:36.050> bank<00:03:36.230> picking<00:03:36.560> up<00:03:36.680> fish<00:03:37.010> with<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.310> lizard

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
the bank picking up fish with the lizard

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.030 
the bank picking up fish with the lizard
but<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.360> honestly<00:03:38.540> think<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.170> bigger<00:03:39.410> fish<00:03:39.680> if

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
but I honestly think the bigger fish if

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.320 
but I honestly think the bigger fish if
we're<00:03:40.190> going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.400> find<00:03:40.640> them<00:03:40.790> we're<00:03:41.180> going<00:03:41.270> to

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
we're going to find them we're going to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.060 
we're going to find them we're going to
be<00:03:41.450> out<00:03:41.600> here<00:03:41.630> in<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.470> area<00:03:42.770> that<00:03:42.920> I'm

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
be out here in this area that I'm

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.920 
be out here in this area that I'm
drifting<00:03:43.459> right<00:03:43.580> through<00:03:43.820> here<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.690> know<00:03:44.780> on

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
drifting right through here you know on

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.740 
drifting right through here you know on
the<00:03:45.020> windswept<00:03:45.590> side<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.300> littered

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
the windswept side it's just littered

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.440 
the windswept side it's just littered
with<00:03:47.780> cover<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.760> not<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.820> lot<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.000> structural

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
with cover and not a lot of structural

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.120 
with cover and not a lot of structural
change<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.260> it's<00:03:51.380> just<00:03:51.440> littered<00:03:51.770> with<00:03:51.800> cover

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
change but it's just littered with cover

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.370 
change but it's just littered with cover
just<00:03:52.790> out<00:03:53.000> here<00:03:53.150> off<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.420> bank<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.870> most

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
just out here off the bank and most

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.080 
just out here off the bank and most
people<00:03:54.650> overlook<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.190> kind<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.430> stuff<00:03:55.700> yeah

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
people overlook that kind of stuff yeah

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.940 
people overlook that kind of stuff yeah
and<00:03:56.300> what<00:03:56.690> if<00:03:56.780> with<00:03:57.440> some<00:03:57.590> quality

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
and what if with some quality

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.680 
and what if with some quality
electronics<00:03:58.520> it<00:03:58.670> allows<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.270> see<00:03:59.480> that

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
electronics it allows you to see that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.170 
electronics it allows you to see that
stuff<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.590> turn<00:04:00.830> around<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.100> fish<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:01.910> I

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
stuff and turn around and fish it so I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.740 
stuff and turn around and fish it so I
think<00:04:03.050> using<00:04:03.790> using<00:04:04.790> electronics<00:04:05.450> even<00:04:05.570> on

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
think using using electronics even on

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.530 
think using using electronics even on
small<00:04:05.930> bodies<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.500> water<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.540> is
