00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
Slayer and you guys will see that my

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.909 
Slayer and you guys will see that my

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
last level is a slayer level i think

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.979 
last level is a slayer level i think
thats<00:04:10.190> low<00:04:10.400> level<00:04:10.730> should<00:04:10.819> be<00:04:10.880> 83<00:04:11.209> which<00:04:11.780> means

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
thats low level should be 83 which means

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.569 
thats low level should be 83 which means
i<00:04:12.079> can<00:04:12.200> just<00:04:12.290> purple<00:04:12.620> mate<00:04:12.769> spiritual<00:04:13.310> majors
