all right the movement morning today is
a<00:00:13.539> slightly<00:00:14.110> more<00:00:14.259> difficult<00:00:14.440> move<00:00:14.829> than

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
a slightly more difficult move than

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.869 
a slightly more difficult move than
we've<00:00:15.129> been<00:00:15.160> aware<00:00:15.339> in<00:00:15.459> the<00:00:15.549> last<00:00:15.700> couple

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
we've been aware in the last couple

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.580 
we've been aware in the last couple
weeks<00:00:15.999> but<00:00:16.900> it's<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.109> fun<00:00:17.320> one

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
weeks but it's a fun one

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.620 
weeks but it's a fun one
and<00:00:17.679> it's<00:00:18.099> a<00:00:18.220> staple<00:00:18.609> of<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.820> lot<00:00:19.210> of<00:00:19.330> routines

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
and it's a staple of a lot of routines

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.120 
and it's a staple of a lot of routines
and<00:00:19.869> definitely<00:00:20.170> a<00:00:20.230> crowd-pleaser<00:00:20.800> it's

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
and definitely a crowd-pleaser it's

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.439 
and definitely a crowd-pleaser it's
called<00:00:21.279> the<00:00:21.340> shadow<00:00:21.580> pass<00:00:21.849> and<00:00:22.150> it<00:00:22.300> looks

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
called the shadow pass and it looks

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.829 
called the shadow pass and it looks
something<00:00:22.810> just<00:00:23.019> like<00:00:23.140> this<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:25.449> right<00:00:25.630> it's

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
something just like this all right it's

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.620 
something just like this all right it's
a<00:00:25.929> blind<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:27.369> a<00:00:27.460> blind<00:00:27.640> catch<00:00:28.029> which<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.509> one

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
a blind it's a blind catch which is one

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.499 
a blind it's a blind catch which is one
of<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.750> most<00:00:28.869> difficult<00:00:29.019> parts<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:31.240> really

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
of the most difficult parts but really

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.029 
of the most difficult parts but really
the<00:00:31.630> best<00:00:31.749> way<00:00:31.900> to<00:00:31.990> start<00:00:32.259> practicing<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.860> is

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
the best way to start practicing it is

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.190 
the best way to start practicing it is
literally<00:00:33.789> to<00:00:34.000> just<00:00:34.030> take<00:00:34.329> a<00:00:34.360> bow<00:00:34.600> you<00:00:35.170> can

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
literally to just take a bow you can

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.869 
literally to just take a bow you can
also<00:00:35.379> do<00:00:35.559> this<00:00:35.649> with<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.890> tin<00:00:36.100> but<00:00:36.309> it's<00:00:36.460> for

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
also do this with the tin but it's for

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.100 
also do this with the tin but it's for
practice<00:00:37.210> sake<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:37.539> I'd<00:00:37.660> eat<00:00:37.809> you<00:00:37.899> at<00:00:38.020> the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
practice sake so I'd eat you at the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.340 
practice sake so I'd eat you at the
bottle<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:39.280> literally<00:00:39.610> just<00:00:39.789> hand<00:00:40.329> it<00:00:40.510> behind

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
bottle and literally just hand it behind

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.900 
bottle and literally just hand it behind
your<00:00:41.590> head<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:43.300> like<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:45.640> as<00:00:45.789> you

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
your head just like so and then as you

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
your head just like so and then as you
practice<00:00:46.710> start<00:00:47.710> getting<00:00:48.219> used<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.930> just

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
practice start getting used to just

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.799 
practice start getting used to just
doing<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.410> little<00:00:50.949> throw<00:00:51.250> just<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.269> turning<00:00:52.719> in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390

thing<00:01:25.689> is<00:01:26.020> just<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.680> pointer<00:01:27.130> on<00:01:27.159> how<00:01:27.400> to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
thing is just a pointer on how to

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.370 
thing is just a pointer on how to
actually<00:01:27.790> choose<00:01:28.000> move<00:01:28.299> I've<00:01:29.049> had<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.259> couple

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
actually choose move I've had a couple

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.929 
actually choose move I've had a couple
students<00:01:29.860> say<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.280> when<00:01:30.490> they<00:01:30.610> throw<00:01:30.850> it

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
students say that when they throw it

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.210 
students say that when they throw it
they<00:01:31.119> watch<00:01:31.299> their<00:01:31.600> catching<00:01:31.990> hand<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.710> find

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
they watch their catching hand I find

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.130 
they watch their catching hand I find
that<00:01:33.310> really<00:01:33.430> difficult<00:01:33.729> because<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.899> only

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
that really difficult because you only

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.920 
that really difficult because you only
have<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.409> split<00:01:35.799> second<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.329> adjust<00:01:37.329> where<00:01:37.810> your

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
have a split second to adjust where your

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.270 
have a split second to adjust where your
hands<00:01:38.170> gonna<00:01:38.350> be<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.680> once<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:38.979> see<00:01:39.159> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
hands gonna be you once you see the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.639 
hands gonna be you once you see the
bottle<00:01:39.579> coming<00:01:39.850> out<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:40.030> your<00:01:40.119> periphery<00:01:40.649> what
