content<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.019> think<00:04:19.109> commentators<00:04:19.889> really

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
content so I think commentators really

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.640 
content so I think commentators really
really<00:04:20.400> rely<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.570> know<00:04:21.690> bad<00:04:21.900> lobbies<00:04:22.440> and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
really rely on you know bad lobbies and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.560 
really rely on you know bad lobbies and
in<00:04:22.919> all<00:04:23.070> honesty<00:04:23.099> it's<00:04:23.669> what<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.240> what<00:04:24.450> we

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
in all honesty it's what we it's what we

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.060 
in all honesty it's what we it's what we
fuel<00:04:25.050> are<00:04:25.260> gentle<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:25.770> it's<00:04:25.890> more

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
fuel are gentle and so it's more

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.010

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
when we play pubs like this we're hoping

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.740 
when we play pubs like this we're hoping
to<00:05:46.259> get<00:05:46.409> you<00:05:46.590> know<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.860> 66<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.550> 3<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.969> 95<00:05:48.509> and

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
to get you know the 66 and 3 the 95 and

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.050 
to get you know the 66 and 3 the 95 and
five<00:05:48.960> we're<00:05:49.500> hoping<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:50.190> get<00:05:50.340> games<00:05:50.610> like<00:05:50.849> that

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
five we're hoping to get games like that

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.370 
five we're hoping to get games like that
and<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.449> doesn't<00:05:51.750> mean<00:05:51.870> we're<00:05:52.050> successful

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
and that doesn't mean we're successful

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.649 
and that doesn't mean we're successful
it<00:05:52.770> just<00:05:52.979> it<00:05:53.219> just<00:05:53.279> looks<00:05:53.759> impressive<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:54.509> and

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
it just it just looks impressive so and

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.209 
it just it just looks impressive so and
I<00:05:54.690> think<00:05:54.900> that's<00:05:55.050> why<00:05:55.169> we<00:05:55.349> do<00:05:55.500> it<00:05:55.650> i<00:05:55.740> think<00:05:55.919> i

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
I think that's why we do it i think i

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.129 
I think that's why we do it i think i
think<00:05:56.279> many<00:05:56.699> people<00:05:57.000> are<00:05:57.060> capable<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.599> it<00:05:57.719> just

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
think many people are capable of it just

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.170 
think many people are capable of it just
a<00:05:58.199> lot<00:05:58.319> of<00:05:58.440> people<00:05:58.680> maybe<00:05:59.520> can't<00:05:59.819> get<00:06:00.000> them<00:06:00.120> on

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
a lot of people maybe can't get them on

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.790 
a lot of people maybe can't get them on
a<00:06:00.240> consistent<00:06:00.509> basis<00:06:01.020> so<00:06:01.110> a<00:06:01.139> lot<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.380> them<00:06:01.529> bash

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
a consistent basis so a lot of them bash

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.499 
a consistent basis so a lot of them bash
it<00:06:02.069> and<00:06:02.219> that's<00:06:02.789> just<00:06:02.880> my<00:06:03.060> personal<00:06:03.449> opinion

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
it and that's just my personal opinion

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.089 
it and that's just my personal opinion
on<00:06:03.870> there's<00:06:04.110> many<00:06:04.289> different<00:06:04.380> ways<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.889> play<00:06:05.069> a
