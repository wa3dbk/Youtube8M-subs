00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.799
 we perform an inspection in an interior for 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.250
 trace and verify the system 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.250
 plumber 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.450
 before proceeding check the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 camera settings by operating 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.760
 on the ring to perform the setting 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.859
 fire help yourself with a thermal footprint 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 if the surface does not offer enough 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.779
 contract more important than the choice 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 the color palette is the adjustment 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 of the scale in manual mode 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.250
 once the temperature has been checked 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.270
 of the surface to be inspected 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 concentrate the colors chosen in a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.670
 shortest range possible for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 guarantee the highest color contrast 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.420
 a scale too diluted indeed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 may not highlight important 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 information if working on tiles i 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.100
 thermal reflections disturb the correct 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.960
 image interpretation 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 identify reference points 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 like tile joints or with 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.590
 a thermal footprint move by some 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 grade the framing all you do 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.090
 moves away or approaches our points 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 reference is to be considered a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.470
 reflected the thermal traces that instead 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.479
 remain in their place are from 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 consider real variations of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.340
 surface temperature in case of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.860
 loss of the thermal map profile 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 it will not be linear but spotty 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.479
 generally irregular, the greater it is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 the sensitivity of the camera 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.250
 the most obvious will be used 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.520
 tracks and viewable in less time 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.170
 therefore to speed up the surveys is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
 useful to create a thermal contrast 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.880
 suitable for example heating 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 the environment to map the plant to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.229
 sanitary cold water or cool it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.780
 to trace the passage of that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.479
 hot in case you want to inspect 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.159
 home a radiant floor appears 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 the operation must be performed at startup 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.490
 plant 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 possibly in the cold environment 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 floor will start to warm up in the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.479
 passage point of the pipe below 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 in addition to the simple mapping it is 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.530
 possible to verify the only ormita of the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.729
 flow and identify any leaks
