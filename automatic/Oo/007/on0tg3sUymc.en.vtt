watch<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.020> changes<00:03:54.410> as<00:03:54.530> we<00:03:54.620> go<00:03:54.740> through<00:03:54.950> them

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
watch the changes as we go through them

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.600 
watch the changes as we go through them
one<00:03:55.550> step<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.970> think<00:03:58.960> you<00:03:59.960> see

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
one step I think you see

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.790 
one step I think you see
gee

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.610 

okay<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.430> go<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.060> minor

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.430 

okay<00:04:11.159> so<00:04:12.090> hopefully<00:04:12.360> those<00:04:12.480> carbs<00:04:12.989> make<00:04:13.170> sense

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
okay so hopefully those carbs make sense

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.440 
okay so hopefully those carbs make sense
now<00:04:14.010> if<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.220> start<00:04:14.489> on<00:04:14.549> power<00:04:14.760> what<00:04:15.330> are<00:04:15.390> you

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
now if you start on power what are you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.979 
now if you start on power what are you
gonna<00:04:15.569> do<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.229> we're<00:04:16.500> gonna<00:04:16.590> take<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:18.090> courts

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
gonna do is we're gonna take the courts

gonna do is we're gonna take the courts
we're<00:04:19.410> gonna<00:04:19.500> take<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.889> mask<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.940> two

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
we're gonna take the mask to like two

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.820 
we're gonna take the mask to like two
quarts<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.780> one<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.109> we're<00:04:22.199> gonna<00:04:22.320> play<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.800> E

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
quarts of one so we're gonna play the E

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.430 
quarts of one so we're gonna play the E
minor<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.580> eighth<00:04:23.790> together<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:25.169> C

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
minor and the eighth together and the C

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.080 
minor and the eighth together and the C
and<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> G<00:04:25.830> together<00:04:26.370> sort<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.639> thing<00:04:26.790> okay

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
and the G together sort of thing okay

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.219 
and the G together sort of thing okay
and<00:04:27.240> I'll<00:04:27.330> explain<00:04:27.540> what<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.750> mean<00:04:27.780> by<00:04:27.900> that

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
and I'll explain what I mean by that

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.920 
and I'll explain what I mean by that
we're<00:04:28.860> gonna<00:04:28.979> take<00:04:29.220> each<00:04:29.430> strums<00:04:29.910> okay<00:04:30.870> so

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
we're gonna take each strums okay so

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.960 
we're gonna take each strums okay so
each<00:04:31.229> just<00:04:31.410> x<00:04:31.620> times<00:04:31.710> one<00:04:32.130> two<00:04:32.340> three<00:04:32.669> four

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
each just x times one two three four

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.360 
each just x times one two three four
five<00:04:33.270> six<00:04:33.540> seven<00:04:33.810> eight<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.410> we're<00:04:35.190> going<00:04:35.310> to

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
five six seven eight and we're going to

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.159 
five six seven eight and we're going to
divide<00:04:35.669> those<00:04:35.940> H<00:04:36.150> strums<00:04:36.510> between<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> a

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
divide those H strums between the a

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.469 
divide those H strums between the a
minor<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.010> F<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.460> start<00:04:38.639> off<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:38.970> now

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
minor and the F to start off with now

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.400 
minor and the F to start off with now
what<00:04:39.630> we're<00:04:39.720> gonna<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.020> we're<00:04:40.110> gonna<00:04:40.199> give

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.189 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna give
the<00:04:40.530> EMA<00:04:40.860> knife<00:04:41.510> we're<00:04:42.510> gonna<00:04:42.630> get<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.840> three

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
the EMA knife we're gonna get a three

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.990 
the EMA knife we're gonna get a three
strums<00:04:43.530> okay<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.039> one<00:04:44.669> two<00:04:45.180> three<00:04:46.820> then<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
strums okay so one two three then the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.060 
strums okay so one two three then the
leftover<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.720> mean<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.110> five<00:04:49.380> strums<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
leftover that I mean and five strums the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.159 
leftover that I mean and five strums the
leftover<00:04:51.030> from<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.300> ear<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.810> we're<00:04:52.050> gonna

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.580 
leftover from the ear is we're gonna
play<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.470> chord<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:53.039> that

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
okay so you can see the F chord comes on

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.050 
okay so you can see the F chord comes on
the<00:05:06.400> four<00:05:07.169> one<00:05:08.169> two<00:05:08.530> three<00:05:08.800> four<00:05:09.160> five<00:05:09.730> six

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
a C in the G so when you change to the C

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.990 
a C in the G so when you change to the C
you're<00:05:16.000> gonna<00:05:16.180> be<00:05:16.419> one<00:05:17.230> two<00:05:17.740> three<00:05:18.250> on<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.790> C

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
you're gonna be one two three on the C

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.790 
you're gonna be one two three on the C
cage<00:05:19.510> up<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.900> G<00:05:20.110> four<00:05:20.800> five<00:05:21.250> six

and that can it gives you like a

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.260 
and that can it gives you like a
different<00:06:04.889> dynamic<00:06:05.190> between<00:06:05.520> the<00:06:05.730> two<00:06:05.820> parks

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
different dynamic between the two parks
