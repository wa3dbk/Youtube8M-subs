and<00:04:33.900> then<00:04:34.110> I'll<00:04:34.229> close<00:04:34.439> this<00:04:34.650> back<00:04:34.889> down<00:04:35.129> here

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and then I'll close this back down here

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.260 
and then I'll close this back down here
in<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.580> front

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
and then the whole front here will fold

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.290 
and then the whole front here will fold
down<00:04:46.950> we<00:04:47.950> just<00:04:48.160> unzip<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.700> from<00:04:48.880> this<00:04:49.060> side

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
down we just unzip it from this side

00:04:49.300 --> 00:05:05.730 
down we just unzip it from this side
