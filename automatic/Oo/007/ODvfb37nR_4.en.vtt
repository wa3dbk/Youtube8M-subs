from<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> world<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> wine<00:00:59.309> something<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.030> think

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
from the world of wine something I think

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.039 
from the world of wine something I think
very<00:01:00.809> all-new<00:01:01.340> certainly<00:01:02.340> new<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.750> why

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
very all-new certainly new and but why

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
very all-new certainly new and but why
shouldn't<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.559> cult<00:01:04.799> wine<00:01:04.979> costs<00:01:05.250> ten<00:01:05.460> dollars

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
shouldn't a cult wine costs ten dollars

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
shouldn't a cult wine costs ten dollars
as<00:01:05.909> opposed<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> fight<00:01:06.510> well<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.170> sounds<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
as opposed to fight well it sounds like

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.990 
as opposed to fight well it sounds like
a<00:01:07.710> good<00:01:07.860> idea<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.159> me<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a good idea to me but it's just it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510 
a good idea to me but it's just it
wasn't<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.510> planned<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.220> no<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
wasn't really planned that way no I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.469 
wasn't really planned that way no I
guess<00:01:11.909> no<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> guess<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.140> wasn't<00:01:13.290> no<00:01:13.909> we<00:01:14.909> weren't

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
guess no I guess it wasn't no we weren't

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
guess no I guess it wasn't no we weren't
really<00:01:15.810> trying<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.500> create<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> call<00:01:17.250> friend

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
really trying to create a call friend

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
really trying to create a call friend
but<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> mean<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> happened<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.290> have

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
but I mean that kind of happened we have

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
but I mean that kind of happened we have
wine<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> sell<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> meet

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
wine we like to sell we like to meet

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840 
wine we like to sell we like to meet
people<00:01:21.509> who<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> buy<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.369> don't

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
people who like to buy it and I don't

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.890 
people who like to buy it and I don't
think<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> any<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.299> complicated<00:01:24.720> than<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
think is any more complicated than that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
think is any more complicated than that
yeah<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> fact<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.520> most

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
yeah the fact is that that for most

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.670 
yeah the fact is that that for most
wines<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.540> there's<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:29.030> sanitized

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
wines that there's this very sanitized

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.910 
wines that there's this very sanitized
carefully<00:01:31.680> crafted<00:01:32.490> view<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> world<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
carefully crafted view of the world that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
carefully crafted view of the world that
they<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.430> try<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> put<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> market

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
they that they try to put on the market

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.480 
they that they try to put on the market
and<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.439> think<00:01:37.650> people<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.130> getting<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and I think people are getting to the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.539 
and I think people are getting to the
point<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:38.880> where<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:41.220> buy<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
point where where they just don't buy it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.969 
point where where they just don't buy it
anymore<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.680> too
