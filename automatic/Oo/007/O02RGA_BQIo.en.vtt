offering<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.400> general<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
offering I think in general I'm just

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.609 
offering I think in general I'm just
better<00:00:30.119> off<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.510> keepers<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:31.439> get

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
better off with all keepers but then get

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
better off with all keepers but then get
on<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.949> his<00:00:32.070> stats<00:00:32.309> everything<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:32.880> pushed<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
on to his stats everything got pushed to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.000 
on to his stats everything got pushed to
a<00:00:33.329> good<00:00:33.570> apart<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.050> speed<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> kicking

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
a good apart from speed and kicking

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.680 
a good apart from speed and kicking
which<00:00:35.130> don't<00:00:35.340> normally<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.730> upgraded<00:00:36.149> but

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
