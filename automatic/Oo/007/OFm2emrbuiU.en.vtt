00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.669 
in here I do plan to put a cage in here
and<00:00:30.480> put<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> dough's<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and put one of the dough's in there a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
and put one of the dough's in there a
little<00:00:31.949> bit<00:00:32.070> later<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.600> as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
little bit later on as you can see I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
little bit later on as you can see I
have<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.410> pieces<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.800> wood<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.160> across<00:00:35.520> one

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
have two pieces of wood going across one

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.729 
have two pieces of wood going across one
on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> front<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.899> back<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.500> then

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
on the front one in the back and then

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.920 
on the front one in the back and then
I'm<00:00:37.829> using<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.160> scrap<00:00:38.489> pieces<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.940> metal<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I'm using these scrap pieces of metal to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.330 
I'm using these scrap pieces of metal to
go<00:00:40.079> through<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> top<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> cage<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
go through the top of the cage to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.450 
go through the top of the cage to
suspend<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.350> how<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> works<00:00:43.770> with

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
suspend it you can see how it works with

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
suspend it you can see how it works with
this<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.789> over<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> hutch

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
this one over here here I have the hutch

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
this one over here here I have the hutch
that<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.950> made<00:00:47.160> last<00:00:47.430> year<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.969> also<00:00:48.420> modified<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that I made last year I also modified it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.569 
that I made last year I also modified it
so<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.280> suspend<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> cage<00:00:52.579> originally

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so it it can suspend the cage originally

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.090 
so it it can suspend the cage originally
I<00:00:53.610> had<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.000> floor<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> front<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.890> hutch

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I had a floor and a front on this hutch

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.330 
I had a floor and a front on this hutch
I<00:00:56.399> had<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> floor<00:00:57.329> wire<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.739> top<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.250> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I had the floor wire on top of this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
I had the floor wire on top of this
wooden<00:00:59.760> slat<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> side<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.559> found

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
wooden slat here on the side and I found

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
wooden slat here on the side and I found
out<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> hard<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.789> doesn't<00:01:03.090> work

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
out the hard way that that doesn't work

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
out the hard way that that doesn't work
very<00:01:03.270> well<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.930> droppings<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.680> urine

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
very well because droppings and urine

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.700 
very well because droppings and urine
collect<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:06.840> very<00:01:07.049> important<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
collect on that it's very important that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230 
collect on that it's very important that
when<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> wire<00:01:08.340> bottom<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> cage

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
when you have a wire bottom on a cage

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
when you have a wire bottom on a cage
that<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.869> anything<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.590> against

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that you don't have anything up against

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
that you don't have anything up against
that<00:01:11.130> wire<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.850> catch<00:01:12.060> droppings<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.689> urine

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that wire to catch droppings and urine

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.420 
that wire to catch droppings and urine
because<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> will<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.799> make<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> big<00:01:14.220> mess

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
because that will just make a big mess

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
because that will just make a big mess
so<00:01:15.150> I've<00:01:15.240> modified<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.229> suspend<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so I've modified it so I can suspend the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
so I've modified it so I can suspend the
cage<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.610> nothing<00:01:18.000> below<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> cage<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
cage there's nothing below the cage and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.300 
cage there's nothing below the cage and
hopefully<00:01:19.500> that'll<00:01:19.650> keep<00:01:19.770> things<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> little

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hopefully that'll keep things a little

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.080 
hopefully that'll keep things a little
more<00:01:20.549> tidy<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.540> summer<00:01:23.060> currently<00:01:24.060> I

last<00:01:35.070> year<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.549> made<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> video<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.420> how<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.750> made

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
last year I made a video on how I made

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
last year I made a video on how I made
this<00:01:37.320> last<00:01:38.100> year<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> had<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> an<00:01:39.119> upside<00:01:39.479> down

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
this last year I had a an upside down

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
this last year I had a an upside down
plastic<00:01:40.140> tote<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.890> used<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
plastic tote that I used for the the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.800 
plastic tote that I used for the the
shelter<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> end

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
shelter on the end

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
shelter on the end
now<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.070> wood<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
now I actually put some wood on the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.280 
now I actually put some wood on the
sides<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> little<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.320> durable

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
sides to make it a little more durable

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
sides to make it a little more durable
currently<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.979> second<00:01:50.399> dough<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.729> here

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
currently I have my second dough in here

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.880 
currently I have my second dough in here
but<00:01:51.240> she'll<00:01:51.450> soon<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
but she'll soon be going to one of the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
but she'll soon be going to one of the
suspended<00:01:53.369> cages<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.909> well<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.840> I'll<00:01:54.990> be

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
suspended cages as well then I'll be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
suspended cages as well then I'll be
using<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.649> cage<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.159> well<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.670> other

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
using this cage as well as my other

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.840 
using this cage as well as my other
smaller<00:01:57.780> cage<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> young<00:01:59.130> rabbits<00:01:59.549> after

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
smaller cage for the young rabbits after

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
smaller cage for the young rabbits after
they're<00:02:00.000> weaned<00:02:00.229> until<00:02:01.229> they're<00:02:01.469> ready<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> be

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
they're weaned until they're ready to be

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.819 
they're weaned until they're ready to be
processed<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.290> nice<00:02:04.290> part<00:02:04.619> about<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
processed for me a nice part about that

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
processed for me a nice part about that
is<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.369> access<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.030> ground<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is they have access to the ground and so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.670 
is they have access to the ground and so
I<00:02:06.659> won't<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> feed<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.500> many

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
I won't have to feed them as many

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
I won't have to feed them as many
pallets<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.459> it'd<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.610> able<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
pallets because it'd be able to get a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.650 
pallets because it'd be able to get a
lot<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> their<00:02:09.959> nutrition<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> ground

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
lot of their nutrition from the ground

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.850 
lot of their nutrition from the ground
one<00:02:12.660> thing<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.930> keep<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.170> mind<00:02:13.440> with<00:02:13.590> Kay

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
one thing to keep in mind with Kay

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
one thing to keep in mind with Kay
is<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.160> allow<00:02:14.340> access<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.970> ground<00:02:15.240> is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
is that allow access to the ground is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.150 
is that allow access to the ground is
that<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> rabbits<00:02:16.050> sometimes<00:02:16.740> we'll<00:02:16.950> try<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that the rabbits sometimes we'll try to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160 
that the rabbits sometimes we'll try to
dig<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.550> generally<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.600> happens<00:02:18.990> with

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
dig out generally that happens with

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.230 
dig out generally that happens with
older<00:02:19.440> rabbits<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.580> DOE<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.150> there

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
older rabbits the DOE I have in there

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.270 
older rabbits the DOE I have in there
now<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:22.140> five<00:02:22.410> months<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.920> she<00:02:23.070> hasn't

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
now is is five months and she hasn't

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.890 
now is is five months and she hasn't
started<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.790> dig<00:02:24.000> yet<00:02:24.210> but<00:02:24.420> actually<00:02:24.780> gets

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
started to dig yet but actually gets

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.300 
started to dig yet but actually gets
older<00:02:25.140> she<00:02:25.260> might<00:02:25.440> try<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> dig<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.070> and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
older she might try to dig out and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.860 
older she might try to dig out and
that's<00:02:26.790> why<00:02:27.000> I'm<00:02:27.060> gonna<00:02:27.240> actually<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.660> moving

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that's why I'm gonna actually be moving

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.530 
that's why I'm gonna actually be moving
her<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.350> another<00:02:28.800> cage<00:02:29.100> instead<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
her to another cage instead if you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.550
