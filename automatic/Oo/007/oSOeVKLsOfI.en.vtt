00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.040
 well here ends what I wanted 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.010
 ee 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.050
 the cant was missing from novelda 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.509
 this 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.049
 percent what it is whatever it is called previously the camera dedicated 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.160
 the day and in fact produces a repetition of the sound that one is 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.289
 touching 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.820
 let's listen to them 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.380
 pancho if I played 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.440
 without the pear 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.819
 Russia is simply known to pulse 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.819
 the peralta 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.569
 mere repetition 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.750
 I can do this repetition 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.740
 much more extensive 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.180
 ansa 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 I can not do anything 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.240
 short 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 very strong 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 I could almost repeat once before 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.870
 kato to put a little bit beyond 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.580
 career 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.940
 and I can also give you different speeds and the street of the city 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.610
 half 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 I can take it to the moment 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 how fast 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 here previously you do not notice 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450
 efe 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.020
 the sun delight but you have to be very careful how to use it just touched 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 the theme of speed 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.010
 why 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.850
 one does not put it in a time more or less the one predicted for this or that song 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.140
 for the rhythm of personal treatment for the speed of this or that song 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.380
 can come to stay as crossed past and try to achieve 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.250
 post it 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.070
 on the subject for this I would recommend for example telling the drummer that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310
 touch the theme time 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 only by pressing once before 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.120
 the home the balance 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.340
 rhythmic 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 per cent can be used both in a group 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 of traditional rudisi rocanrol features for example 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.600
 with this sound 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 steel 50 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.559
 bergara 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.559
 nothing of 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:18.739
 the corpse in the garage must sell 10% 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.519
 but 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.940
 or it could be used in a way 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.940
 maybe more 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.770
 I do not know whether to say modern because it would also be very modern 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.890
 but not how many songs are heard like a pedal 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.890
 open that they gave him the car body that filed charges 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.449
 inside a hangar 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.449
 darias 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.369
 the 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.369
 l 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.939
 I repeat was the phrase to be understood as how it is distributed 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.019
 the signal 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.040
 l the use of regrets is very weak and I would say necessary 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.080
 in a threesome 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.639
 because he will be able to still 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.559
 being the style of music that was 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.909
 because it's going to give a much greater range of possibilities was it going to be that 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.709
 the band sound 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.559
 is not so 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.529
 limited so constant 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:28.379
 so similar in theme one can achieve in a subject a type of climate in which 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.529
 that we say 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.179
 slow theme or a theme with a with a 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.379
 subtle weather 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.290
 we use the corus for example also alcorcÃ³n the delegate a very very effect 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.290
 very cute together 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:49.889
 Maradona 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.429
 lavalle 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:55.619
 in the unal 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:56.830
 The amplitude 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.069
 of that mobile signal since the alcohol that we can not use it to a very effect 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.890
 the strip and only as its moment showed by the managing director 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.470
 there are possibilities of combination and within the same penal possibilities 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.580
 of sound change that are too rich to appear
