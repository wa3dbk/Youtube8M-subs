 hi i am a princess and today we are 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.540
 look to hurt demo indie horror and 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.730
 called kona trailer game 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.460
 looks very cool developers 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.860
 promise big open to research 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.410
 world of many interesting puzzles 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.540
 interesting plot and now let's 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 take a quick look at the demo 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:40.780
 the snowmobile game us 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.300
 familiar familiar cool winter on a snowmobile 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.470
 ki ride 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:54.500
 although it is better to warm up on skis 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:58.600
 steep hero 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 let's get a pretty penny 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.180
 here we have here and here 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 polishko 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:21.050
 it's great to be warm in the woods now 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:24.410
 great yes look game is made on 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:30.500
 unity engine and everything looks so let's say 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:36.340
 even well you need to take pictures of us 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.340
 Apparently some kind of reporter has such a paw 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:46.130
 immediately reminded amnesia 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.160
 We give Asia by the way I remind you that the microphone is for 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.180
 100 rubles therefore the sound of a voice 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.490
 sounds a little different 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.650
 and in this game, of course, the microphone 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.070
 professional studio me 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.160
 then all the fire bonfire 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.730
 that's what this lighter is for 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.940
 on the street of course winter is winter is very winter 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.690
 coldly 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:18.650
 it will be necessary at times to burn such 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.050
 bonfire checks stove so that our hero could 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.630
 get warm 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:31.340
 I will give some more house 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 let's see what we have here and here 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.750
 it seems cleaner to 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.959
 Nothing opens 100 but you can 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 sleep hero 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.989
 at least there is a tidy bed 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.430
 whole here in open space to the hero 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.340
 chilly 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:01.340
 they need of course a source of heat right away 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.489
 find now he will warm 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.700
 then remember how the team harare what game 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.870
 there was a similar system 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.019
 I think it was a penumbra third 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.629
 the same effect was before write your 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.129
 options where the hero also froze later 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:26.269
 warmed so well what about money to mine 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.450
 no big except these houses 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:35.210
 what 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:39.140
 During the ride itself can be a general 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:44.980
 developers promise a big open 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:48.370
 a world that will bring many interesting things 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.110
 where you can ride a snowmobile 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.270
 which promises a lot of interesting and 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.650
 night to fight with you together 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.569
 imagine 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.249
 let there be some monsters 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:08.760
 Well, let's see how far you can 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:15.780
 go on a snowmobile invisible wall 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:17.660
 directions even while there is no well, that idea 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.109
 the good 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 make horror snows of a snow -covered valley 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.250
 in such houses 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.910
 no one here except monsters 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.420
 he even comes out of the chimney 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:47.650
 everything is fine before optimization 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:51.820
 even worked on the demo and when 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.560
 there will be a full version of the game and be sure 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.160
 I will pass 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.990
 write this game on your channel 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.870
 Be sure to give your feedback like this 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.900
 game on the unity engine, even nothing 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.280
 looks 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.880
 developers have potential 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.080
 Of course on what else to work and from the game 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.080
 get a decent horror 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.600
 MUSIC good I like nice
