00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.900
 very good to everyone how are you like 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.599
 You see I bring a new video this time 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.299
 Inspired by an ad makeup 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.309
 of a gucci perfume the makeup is 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.590
 in golden tones marking a lot the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.480
 outside of the eye and nothing left you 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.220
 watching it and I hope you like this 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.769
 makeup has a lot of lighting 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 so the first thing I do is take a 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.519
 shadow in golden cream and mark the part 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.519
 the first third of the eye 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 next with a shadow in color 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.210
 golden what I do is settle a little 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.400
 more that cream color that we have put 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 previously and also enhance the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.610
 lighting in the lacrimal and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.610
 first third 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.880
 choose a shade in taupe and what 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.630
 I'm going to do is illuminate the central part 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.630
 of this makeup 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 I have 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.049
 with a dark brown shadow what I'm going 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.390
 doing is marking the outside of the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.460
 eye and give it the shape that I want in the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.439
 makeup that inspired me is makeup 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.569
 that especially marks the outside 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.490
 of the eye and takes a lot of shadow 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.229
 outward so what I do mark 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.090
 a line from the tabs 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.090
 bottoms going up 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.200
 and now I frame the basin to give the 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.200
 shape to makeup 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.060
 little by little I'm filling in the area that 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.500
 we have marked I am putting the color already 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.500
 then I'm blurring 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.379
 i 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.690
 two 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.490
 once we have everything integrated into 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.680
 the following mark a little more the 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.240
 part of the upper lashes I choose 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.710
 a black shadow matte just what I'm going 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.210
 doing is putting a little black flush 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.810
 of the eyelashes I also do it in the 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.810
 lower part 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.200
 and with a brush to blur I'll 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.190
 integrating a little more that color 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.190
 dark in the makeup 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.310
 for what has now caught a shadow 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.800
 that gives a lot of light and so you know 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.420
 that this makeup brings a lot of light 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.320
 since we 're going to use almost all of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.320
 Shadow visa 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.670
 in the water line has chosen a call 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.560
 pretty intense black to give a lot 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.570
 deep the look and I'm going to apply 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.990
 both the lower water line and the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.990
 higher 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.360
 nothing eyelash mask we would have 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.129
 finished the makeup 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.810
 on the skin or used the base 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.120
 maybelline fit makeup already 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.430
 then I will choose a proofreader 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.680
 pretty creamy to correct the area 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.479
 of the ujed 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.430
 with some bronzing powder I will give 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.960
 some qualities to the face to 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.729
 then with a beveled brush I'll 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.930
 to give more shape to the cheekbone especially in 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.930
 the bottom 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.590
 for the lips taken a profiler 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.140
 as the name indicates very natural 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.270
 to give a little more lip and 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.700
 I have also chosen a lipstick in shades 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.700
 Toasted browns very very natural 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.539
 in the middle part of the lip take a 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.310
 little bit of transparent gloss to give 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.900
 a little volume and we would have 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.909
 Completely finished this makeup 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.610
 As I always say you can follow me 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:41.009
