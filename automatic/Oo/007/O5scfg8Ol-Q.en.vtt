I'll be showing you guys the exact
location<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.619> there<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:18.570> car<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
location right there and this car is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.439 
location right there and this car is
basically<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> truck<00:00:20.220> that's<00:00:20.460> left<00:00:20.850> dated<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
basically a truck that's left dated and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.060 
basically a truck that's left dated and
I'm<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.869> sure<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> most<00:00:22.769> expensive

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I'm not sure if it's the most expensive

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.009 
I'm not sure if it's the most expensive
it's<00:00:23.519> surely<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.300> most<00:00:24.449> expensive<00:00:24.869> car

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it's surely not the most expensive car

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
it's surely not the most expensive car
it's<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> most<00:00:25.830> rarest<00:00:26.369> car<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
it's not the most rarest car but it is

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.820 
it's not the most rarest car but it is
pretty<00:00:27.420> hard<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> find<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.529> don't<00:00:28.710> know

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
pretty hard to find if you don't know

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.540 
pretty hard to find if you don't know
where<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.160> look

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
where to look

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.849 
where to look
