00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
far i've used velcro to be able to pull

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.860 
far i've used velcro to be able to pull
it<00:00:55.460> out<00:00:55.670> put<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.440> everything<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.390> it's<00:00:59.390> easier

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
it out put in everything so it's easier

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.350 
it out put in everything so it's easier
to<00:01:00.020> work<00:01:00.170> with<00:01:00.230> i<00:01:00.469> didn't<00:01:00.950> tie<00:01:01.730> wrap<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.210> whole

to work with i didn't tie wrap the whole
thing<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.260> connected<00:01:03.829> inside<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.369> box

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
thing it's connected inside the box

thing it's connected inside the box
which<00:01:05.030> i'm<00:01:05.270> gonna<00:01:05.449> change<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:06.229> too<00:01:06.500> small

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
which i'm gonna change it's too small

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.900 
pretty sure i'm going to use like that a
server<00:01:15.170> box<00:01:15.560> or<00:01:15.950> something<00:01:16.070> like<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.399> which

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
server box or something like that which

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.550 
server box or something like that which
is<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.300> be<00:01:17.390> like<00:01:17.600> two<00:01:17.869> times<00:01:18.110> as<00:01:18.500> big

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
is going to be like two times as big

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.290 
is going to be like two times as big
besides<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.800> yeah<00:01:22.520> i'm<00:01:22.610> gonna<00:01:22.759> part<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.119> up

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
besides that yeah i'm gonna part it up

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
connected my 5000 mini amp to SJ nice

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.499 
connected my 5000 mini amp to SJ nice
battery<00:01:34.069> Dean's<00:01:34.970> connector<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.750> my<00:01:36.259> four<00:01:36.920> PL

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
battery Dean's connector and my four PL

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.199 
battery Dean's connector and my four PL
so<00:01:38.509> let's<00:01:39.349> go<00:01:39.530> ahead<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.770> power<00:01:40.069> this<00:01:40.369> up<00:01:40.640> no<00:01:41.179> I

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
so let's go ahead and power this up no I

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.580 
so let's go ahead and power this up no I
didn't<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:42.259> a<00:01:42.349> switch<00:01:43.009> mod<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.910> far<00:01:44.119> i

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
didn't do this on a switch mod so far i

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.870 
didn't do this on a switch mod so far i
still<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.800> my<00:01:45.830> own<00:01:46.130> off<00:01:46.310> switch<00:01:46.610> what's

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
still have my own off switch what's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.350 
still have my own off switch what's
going<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.209> go<00:01:47.360> soon<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:49.280> i<00:01:49.340> power<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.880> up<00:01:50.030> and

front the winch is not powered on yet
tiny<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.580> figure<00:02:01.849> something<00:02:02.119> out<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.080> what<00:02:03.679> I'm

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
tiny to figure something out so what I'm

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.850 
tiny to figure something out so what I'm
going<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.009> move<00:02:04.130> forward<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:06.170> LED<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.649> going

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
going to move forward the LED is going

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.559 
going to move forward the LED is going
to<00:02:06.920> blink<00:02:08.050> like<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.649> do<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.150> reverse

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
to blink like this I do not have reverse

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.500 
to blink like this I do not have reverse
right<00:02:11.840> now<00:02:11.989> I<00:02:12.020> need<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.380> program<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
right now I need to program this on the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.500 
right now I need to program this on the
back<00:02:14.690> when<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.500> push<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.980> brake<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:17.180> have<00:02:17.330> it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
back when I push the brake you have it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.870 
back when I push the brake you have it
this<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:22.489> normal

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
this and this is the like the the normal

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.970 
this and this is the like the the normal
lights<00:02:23.150> when<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.599> not<00:02:23.930> move<00:02:24.140> when<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.680> turn

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
lights when I do not move when I turn

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.020 
lights when I do not move when I turn
right<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.870> banker<00:02:27.230> goes<00:02:27.500> when<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:27.920> turn<00:02:28.189> left

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
right the banker goes when I turn left

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.340 
right the banker goes when I turn left
the<00:02:29.630> banker<00:02:29.959> goes<00:02:30.760> pretty<00:02:31.760> sweet<00:02:32.120> day<00:02:32.350> so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350
