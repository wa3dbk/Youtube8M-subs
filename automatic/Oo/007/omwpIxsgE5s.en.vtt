00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
that I was kind of expecting a little

that I was kind of expecting a little
more<00:05:40.280> I<00:05:40.810> guess<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:41.840> darker<00:05:42.500> grey<00:05:42.800> on<00:05:42.980> dark<00:05:43.340> sides

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
more I guess a darker grey on dark sides

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.550 
more I guess a darker grey on dark sides
face<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:44.300> it's<00:05:44.900> not<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.200> end<00:05:45.230> of<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.410> world

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560

and of course his crotch which really

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.900 
and of course his crotch which really
isn't<00:05:47.180> all<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:48.320> big<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:48.770> deal<00:05:48.890> but<00:05:49.760> on

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910

I know what it was about him I had seen

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.700 
I know what it was about him I had seen
him<00:05:55.910> as<00:05:56.030> a<00:05:56.060> kid<00:05:56.330> in<00:05:56.450> a<00:05:56.660> few<00:05:57.050> comics<00:05:57.380> which<00:05:57.560> was

probably<00:05:57.920> one<00:05:58.610> of<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.790> nostalgia<00:05:59.300> factors

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
probably one of the nostalgia factors

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.640 
probably one of the nostalgia factors
that<00:05:59.720> made<00:05:59.840> me<00:05:59.930> want<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.140> pick<00:06:00.320> this<00:06:00.410> guy<00:06:00.620> up

I'm<00:06:24.410> the<00:06:24.530> button<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:25.870> really<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.080> mean<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.650> have

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
I'm the button I really I mean I have

nothing<00:06:28.220> against<00:06:28.640> the<00:06:28.730> button<00:06:28.970> so<00:06:29.120> i<00:06:29.150> guess<00:06:29.360> i

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
nothing against the button so i guess i

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.600 
nothing against the button so i guess i
really<00:06:29.630> can't<00:06:29.810> complain<00:06:30.050> when<00:06:31.010> i<00:06:31.070> get<00:06:31.310> all<00:06:31.430> of
