00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 Hello friends, we are already spring 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.390
 the weather is just wonderful and i decided 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.189
 instead of recording video at home 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.929
 you can write it on the street try 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.519
 make the video as informative as possible 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.049
 for you so I said what are you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.389
 here more than a year, you can bring 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 totals by how much I spend a month on 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.260
 apartment for gas utilities 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.580
 I have detailed statistics for 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.530
 you and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 I want to share with him even for myself I 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.640
 I’ll summarize my details 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 the numbers of which I did not even know 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.540
 how to be roughly supposed but on 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.259
 the paper did not write down why I want 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.140
 to tell 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.480
 monthly expenses for things like gas 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 electricity 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.030
 water consul text is tax which 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.460
 pay in as I understood by reason 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.379
 strange that or in the treasury of the city well 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.239
 still the example of the Internet can be included here 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 these are the expenses you owe 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.680
 pay and little for what you can 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 save but isn’t the internet 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 either you will pay less there 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 Electricity is included when I 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.170
 I settled immediately came to the water bill 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.269
 I may have already said he is paid for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 year but you can get like monthly 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.080
 but it's best to pay for big if you 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.240
 here you pay for the year and you get discounts 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 quite good up to 20 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.010
 percent for the year I got 300 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.920
 pounds if it's divided by a month it's 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
 get 25 pips a month pay it 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.549
 you plant it hot cold 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.680
 water supply is also considered there to not 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.680
 burn how much do you drain the water in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.120
 sewage all that counts and here 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.110
 among the tariff goes around the house 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.280
 again I will say that this data is not 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 absolute this data can be 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
 correct enough for this area we gvl 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
 in which I live for this property 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
 are there any there 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.720
 same conditions so if you where 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.790
 whether you live in another area then the price 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.760
 of course there will be different but some 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.640
 general idea you can make 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.850
 so here the water turned out 300 pounds it 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.350
 25 pounds a month later the next consul 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.700
 tex 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.940
 as I said it is a tax which 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.550
 must pay monthly last year 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.090
 he was with me 45 pounds a month total 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.680
 it turned out 540 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.229
 again there goes a big discount if you 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.870
 pay once a year what else 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.050
 interestingly this tax itself is very similar 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.390
 on our utilities as i understand you are paying for 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.370
 conceived behind house management 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.140
 Probably I don’t know the example twice 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 week comes the garbage truck which 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.150
 takes mousse that's all there 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.190
 included 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.200
 what else is interesting this year by 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.360
 compared to the last price for consul dix 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.390
 diminished for me last year was 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.790
 45 this year 39 I don't know why the price 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.240
 so diminished but it makes me happy 45 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.459
 pounds a month and 540 is obtained next 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.209
 such a large enough item of expenditure 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.010
 it goes electricity and gas my house 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.680
 connected to n-power system 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
 it means you pay just while you 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.690
 spend you pay for how much you 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.830
 spend gas and electricity bill 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.800
 comes about once every 2-3 months and already 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.930
 you have to pay it here small 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.200
 sign from the site with detailed statistics 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.030
 for the year is quite interesting in the winter here 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.580
 relatively cold as the windows are here 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.290
 with one glass 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.390
 the frames themselves are huge glass so 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.020
 heat loss is big in winter 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.030
 heat 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.100
 very good so at home well respectively 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.780
 they will have to pay more if you don’t 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.140
 you want to pay more you can 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.420
 wrap yourself in warm clothes 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.040
 woolen socks mittens and can 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.960
 save on gas significantly since 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.850
 gas is generally the most expensive thing here 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.800
 I have four hundred in a year 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.560
 thirty six pounds is the maximum 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.209
 then of course the winter months there goes by 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.450
 seventy pounds a month to spend 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.700
 the minimum in summer is 22 average for gas 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.670
 you think you get 36 pounds 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.330
 month before the electricity price does not jump 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.400
 she goes on average from 14 to 23 years old he 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.780
 again less visible as there is less 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.510
 electricity consumed 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.490
 an average of 17 pounds is obtained for 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.350
 electricity gas here on this site by 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.570
 statistics it watched came out six hundred 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.269
 forty pounds a year her average price 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.160
 we got 53 points normal price 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.140
 compared to Russian prices 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.120
 but I also want to turn on the Internet here 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.990
 you can say that too 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.989
 need 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.900
 prices vary here internet in 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.310
 whichever provider 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.410
 what rate you take unlimited not 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.920
 unlimited need you phone is not needed 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.620
 phone 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.330
 you gotta this phone line 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.160
 rent for when you will 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.530
 use the Internet and accordingly 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.940
 telephone number 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.980
 but you can not use or take 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.590
 extra charge for phone and addition 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.290
 month of the phone for rent, telephone and 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.930
 I can’t get 120 pounds 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.270
 paid back for 2015 a week ago 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.950
 year and added to this value goes 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.550
 me unlimited internet on british 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.360
 telecom 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.810
 about 12 megabits per second he will leave 17 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.030
 pounds a month if you count along with 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.570
 three telephone line then it turns out 27 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.640
 pounds a month goes Internet phone 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.550
 I do not speak the phone I do not use if 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.170
 I put the bill on landline phone 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.380
 who could call around the city 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.960
 it would be even more expensive but it would be 6 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.090
 pay for it what else is interesting in this 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.910
 I did not renew the license for 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.360
 television though you owe it too 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.940
 do 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.040
 she is about 120 pounds in my opinion is all 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.020
 who is watching TV or looking at 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.040
 online 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.440
 tv shows 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.480
 don't have to pay for it but since u 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.110
 I have no TV and in the plan I do not 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.070
 look 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.930
 they are not even direct to you 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.480
 air that shows babysitter or 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.520
 other British channels then I did not 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.130
 I sell the license several times 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.810
 the notification came to the post office 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.780
 says that you forgot to pay urgently 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.550
 pay or incur a fine here 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.180
 if you do n't really watch that 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.250
 you can not pay but you have to give 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.770
 report to yourself that if you break something 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.250
 may incur a fine like a thousand 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.950
 pounds 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.170
 coming and any day can come 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.240
 checks that check you true 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.830
 watch tv and add me to 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.710
 of this cost what are watching tv 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.320
 another 120 points but if things add up and 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.130
 I got a sum of one thousand 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.530
 eight hundred pounds that's not counting 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.210
 rent and that's not counting the food not counting 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.220
 transport such price 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.530
 if we divide by 12 months then 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.320
 it turns out 150 pounds a month 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.240
 I thought a little more that I would 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.060
 thought it was a big amount per month 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.850
 I came out of course when compared with 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.430
 Russian prices here they are space but 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.680
 when compared to saving salaries 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.750
 and these expenses 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.220
 quite acceptable even good ones like that 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.290
 information for you and hope it was 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.410
 it is useful for you to try to write something down 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.090
 still is useful to you at a price to 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.040
 I already recorded the products 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.080
 I will make it possible to become out of the current 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.480
 because how much I spend on food per month 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.200
 year somebody like that and of course 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.900
 there will be vlag 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.980
 the weather is getting better thanks for watching 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.390
