00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
different selections of it another thing

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
different selections of it another thing
is<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.299> choose<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> color<00:01:25.320> tolerance

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the same range but if I have a color

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.730 
the same range but if I have a color
tolerance<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.979> zero<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
tolerance of zero then it will as I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.050 
tolerance of zero then it will as I
showed<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.280> before

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060
