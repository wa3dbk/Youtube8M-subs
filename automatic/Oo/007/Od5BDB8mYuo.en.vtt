00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
boost in the sand storm out we think

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.050 
boost in the sand storm out we think
about<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:05.759> about<00:02:05.880> as

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
about it and actually think about as

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
about it and actually think about as
well<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.750> doing<00:02:06.960> fairly<00:02:07.320> well<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.920> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
well so it's doing fairly well and it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.660 
well so it's doing fairly well and it
says<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:09.030> has<00:02:09.300> rest<00:02:09.599> okay<00:02:10.430> I've<00:02:11.430> seen

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
says it has rest okay I've seen

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.809 
says it has rest okay I've seen
everything

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
everything

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:13.979 
everything
and<00:02:12.879> that's<00:02:13.030> kind<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.299> what<00:02:13.450> I'm<00:02:13.599> going<00:02:13.870> off

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
and that's kind of what I'm going off

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.410 
and that's kind of what I'm going off
right<00:02:14.230> now<00:02:14.439> so<00:02:15.129> I'm<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.609> star<00:02:15.909> it<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.239> now

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
right now so I'm a star it is now

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.509 
right now so I'm a star it is now
healthy<00:02:16.810> aegislash<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.370> be

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
healthy aegislash is going to be

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.679 
healthy aegislash is going to be
throwing<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:18.969> is<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.329> gonna<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.540> like

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
throwing out is that gonna be like

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.410 
throwing out is that gonna be like
another<00:02:19.959> flash<00:02:20.319> cannon<00:02:20.590> Oh<00:02:20.829> Shadow<00:02:21.489> Ball<00:02:21.609> it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
another flash cannon Oh Shadow Ball it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.399 
another flash cannon Oh Shadow Ball it's
time<00:02:22.599> going<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.109> dusclops<00:02:25.409> dusclops

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
time going for the dusclops dusclops

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.229 
time going for the dusclops dusclops
does<00:02:26.829> survive<00:02:27.189> it<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.579> man<00:02:27.909> and<00:02:27.939> goes<00:02:28.209> for

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
does survive it like a man and goes for

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.089 
does survive it like a man and goes for
the<00:02:28.450> call<00:02:28.599> mind<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.590> we're<00:02:29.709> going<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.950> boost

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
the call mind so we're going to boost

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.670 
the call mind so we're going to boost
that<00:02:30.219> special<00:02:30.609> defense<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:32.200> really<00:02:32.500> sure

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
that special defense not really sure

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.440 
that special defense not really sure
what<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.129> can<00:02:33.250> get<00:02:33.400> done<00:02:33.579> in<00:02:33.819> all<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.599> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
what it can get done in all of this and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.690 
what it can get done in all of this and
that's<00:02:37.450> yeah<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.680> dusclops<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.519> take<00:02:39.669> a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
that's yeah so dusclops going to take a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.979 
that's yeah so dusclops going to take a
little<00:02:39.790> bit<00:02:39.939> damaged<00:02:40.150> from<00:02:40.269> sandstorm<00:02:40.719> the

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.319 
star in the face and we're doing alright
so<00:03:16.930> my<00:03:17.109> guess<00:03:17.169> I<00:03:17.620> think<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.669> the<00:03:18.790> hydro<00:03:19.209> pump

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
so my guess I think that the hydro pump

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.270 
so my guess I think that the hydro pump
also<00:03:19.689> hits<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.900> random<00:03:20.199> target<00:03:20.530> because<00:03:20.859> like

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
also hits a random target because like

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.589 
also hits a random target because like
it's<00:03:21.459> sleep<00:03:21.699> talk<00:03:21.879> I<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.180> that's<00:03:22.329> how<00:03:22.389> you

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
it's sleep talk I think that's how you

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.149 
it's sleep talk I think that's how you
talk<00:03:22.750> works<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.139> doubles<00:03:23.439> she<00:03:23.829> don't<00:03:23.979> get<00:03:24.069> too

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
talk works in doubles she don't get too

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.300 
talk works in doubles she don't get too
slight<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.430> target<00:03:24.790> now<00:03:25.209> medicham<00:03:25.509> comes<00:03:25.900> in

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
slight to target now medicham comes in

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.890 
slight to target now medicham comes in
get<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.430> see<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.609> mega<00:03:27.819> medicham<00:03:28.239> mega

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
get to see that mega medicham mega

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.170 
get to see that mega medicham mega
medicham<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.949> do<00:03:30.159> all<00:03:30.400> right<00:03:30.729> in<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:30.939> setup

that that pokemons going to be weak to
the<00:04:22.120> hydro<00:04:22.389> pump<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:23.169> anything<00:04:23.919> goes<00:04:24.130> right

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
the hydro pump so anything goes right

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.990 
the hydro pump so anything goes right
now

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
now

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.510 
now
that's<00:04:25.750> gonna<00:04:25.960> be<00:04:26.110> an<00:04:26.200> Intimidator<00:04:26.710> so<00:04:27.370> then

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
that's gonna be an Intimidator so then

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.370 
that's gonna be an Intimidator so then
