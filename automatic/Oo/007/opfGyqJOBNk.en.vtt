 Well, if it is about schema with iphone i will be 23 after 24 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.639
 We all like but I'll be iphone tips of the ne everyone is 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.210
 I have updated the app store app 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:20.720
 For example, that is it 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:26.270
 Still up but that I think I'm apps is open to update the 8 page in that state 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:31.160
 Since the information on the star has been updated, the information on the app store is updated. 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.290
 Until now, in order to update to what I have to take the wind means that say if you 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.440
 Is it 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:43.330
 If you've ever done, start up the app switcher and let's turn off this up element 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:48.790
 Once you launch up-up, so-called update is being done, isn't it new? 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:52.310
 It will be updated to the information, but with this it will take a little time 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.610
 Until now, there was only one way like this, but I will introduce it this time 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.700
 Way what Toko Is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.250
 There is a tab under the app store app 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:08.530
 The tab below 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:13.400
 It is here that it is 10th floor 10th floor It is said that the march of up starts when it is tapped 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.520
 It's a tip, so I think I want to do it right away 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.520
 I 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.610
 I will go 1 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:30.100
 Aichi pen 3 c 4 6 h 89 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:33.350
 Started diary has been updated as I received Yes visit now being counted 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.680
 Yes Well it this is a you 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.360
 I think that the coaching of app store will be very easy 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.140
 Well , let's keep in mind when it is said what useful it is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.240
 There is a place to be puzzled, but if you are really an iphone hard user 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.020
 More it every day It is a place up store 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.370
 For example, the information to in I I think that a look 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.590
 Channel or something of this article 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.340
 still the same kind of information when I went to Appufa when you say I want to see the c information 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
 There was no 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.890
 In such a case, I think that I should update 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 Well that's probably not the case 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.860
 If you look a lot 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.460
 Would not do to be useful is this trick 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.690
