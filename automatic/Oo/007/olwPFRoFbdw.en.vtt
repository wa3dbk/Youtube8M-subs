00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.580
 ovidio let's make the droid and I bring them 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.350
 a new whistle and well it goes like 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.810
 complement can be used together with 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.210
 a magma that go can use it together 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.340
 with what is the way I brought them from 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 mineral detector because because 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.240
 Well have you noticed that your detector 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.220
 minerals are detected by some mineral 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.770
 cool and you say or do not find it 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.540
 a meeting so good what they are going to 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.800
 do with this mode that is called quark and 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.720
 which is basically an excavator 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.610
 simply because they will put our 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.830
 detector detected some strange thing or 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.059
 so for example the creation blog langer 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.649
 as I tell you the strait between 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.510
 videos the block lanier to one is very 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.100
 unstable but it is normal not to worry 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.630
 soon they will repair it, good for 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.130
 add se what is which rivanera 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.450
 personalized one is key you speak 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.420
 also but can only add 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.300
 directly with him and from 215 that is 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.920
 the personalized ide is back 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.510
 discover something very important so that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.159
 they grow so much blog launcher what 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.649
 they will do is put it down the 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.030
 difficulty to the minimum in settings translates 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.710
 gifts 215 add add 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.659
 good to put the difficulty in options what 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.159
 they are going to put to the minimum why because what 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.530
 that caused misfortunes with blog launcher 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.360
 is when the entity of the hit or 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.890
 they die and good sometimes in the worlds 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.630
 when I day the zombies are dying 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.909
 and that makes it close at all times 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.619
 so I hope you serve them this typical 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.820
 we are not going to use what is the excavator 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.560
 or the carry in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.390
 let's see here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.649
 they are going to put and how can you see if you generate 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.100
 structure now that they are going to do is 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.070
 put a start box that is the one 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.759
 going to collect everything let's see where it is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.829
 the chest I do not see it as a crafter torch 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.829
 because it is not instruments 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.940
 to see diverse 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.800
 I think we're going to put a chest that's 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.570
 the chest and the excavator or the box and 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.190
 let's add us what is below 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.870
 because he is honest with the sheep that is 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.260
 spoiling we are going to add us what we 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.200
 it's a diamond peak 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.700
 add and forgive so many cuts but it's 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.590
 that the blog launcher does not stop 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 thank you because 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.980
 apparently some way out there died 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.500
 he told them I think he was a villager every 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.540
 corner dies grows every time 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.329
 hits in a grace mode then it's 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.650
 allow the difficulty to help them and if 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.569
 it does not close so much in fact 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.700
 he put there were worlds that can not enter 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.290
 because we had died is the time 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.879
 then you can not enter with a block 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.769
 launcher and then because now I can be the 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.720
 difficulty well I said let's 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.849
 activate it as quarry can be measured 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.620
 active of 12 deactivated excavator and it is 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.750
 something slow is going to take a long time I tried it 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.250
 in monster craft and her giant boyfriend and 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.049
 It will take a little while 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.609
 like to dig everything all everything 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.620
 everything and as I tell them if they use it in 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.900
 set with the mineral detector 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
 well with that same if they detect enough 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.780
 things and if not I was going to put to dig 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.609
 here and that the excavator takes care 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.870
 everything I'm going to recover by collecting 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.120
 will keep it in the chest that is going to 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.769
 create why not decide and again 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.750
 because he also blanch the crash already 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.760
 when it breaks a chest it is so 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.409
 trying to break chests also be 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.569
 super unstable but as I say it is 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.650
 thing about blog launcher el monte los 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.150
 I bring because it will still serve 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.739
 perfectly I know it when I already 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 blanch in this good will work all 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.010
 perfectly without thanks so it 's 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.660
 equal this goal or more so that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.440
 keep and have them as a reference for 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.590
 there 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.080
 the excavation is what I did not like 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.819
 and then they have to wait a long time 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.170
 door is not going to collect anything because 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.180
 well 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.010
 until you get to the minerals more than 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.230
 nothing I'm recovered collects what is 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.420
 minerals there was one that brought you 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.640
 much that nothing else escalated as a 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.890
 depth block they touch on the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.410
 floor and it was like that a hole and everything 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.080
 had underneath it gave them I think it was 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.870
 super mariner is based on destruction 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.390
 also that works in this version 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.250
 this so that they also use it and it is a 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.319
 little more unstable too but it's not the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.209
 super mainer what he does is also like 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.580
 that make a like a bed in bed 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.319
 a super fast mega hole and what 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.590
 get in that time you put it in the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.090
 inventory which is epic 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.090
 and well let's see 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.620
 you have to wait high there is no good 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.510
 we're not going to give any kind of air 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.989
 of ore because you can scream then 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.489
 we are in an area that grew 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.380
 they proclaim to be so they can see what is 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.570
 super initial sure there was a way 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.570
 something out there and murdered him 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.780
 and as you can see there was what is the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.970
 excavator I think that already 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.970
 which is still continuing please 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.889
 comes from coal so next to something there 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.509
 some coal over there 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.620
 and well, good people, I think everything 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.659
 this video is how it works 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.430
 any mineral that you find is 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.930
 will be giving is I'm gathering in 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.330
 given that it is escrache blog launcher 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.189
 for x and reason then try the solution 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.629
 I just gave them and then nothing I think 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.629
 that is all for this video they take care
