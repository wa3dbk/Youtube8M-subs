00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi how are you since this is my first 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 video and it's to talk a little bit 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.440
 better about something I've seen than the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.109
 I make mistakes gamers enough 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.330
 they like many forums in many many 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.090
 Internet pages and even in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.800
 official journals of certain companies 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 of video games that are quite wrong 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.750
 in saying 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.669
 by referring to it better when 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 there is an error in a game in a software 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 we know that an error in a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.839
 game is told buzz that's the way 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.440
 correct to tell a mistake in many 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.079
 people tell them glitch 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.850
 and that is very wrong so I want them 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.680
 talk is a little bit about the difference 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.320
 between a bug a glitch and I'm also going to 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.449
 clarify well what is an interest because 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.129
 as I tell you there are many places in 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.690
 where I have seen that they are quite confused 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.060
 in those who use it in a way 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.880
 atrocious 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.770
 and then to begin with let's see what 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.180
 it is a bug a bug 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.460
 is that flaw in a game that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.390
 is not provided by the programmers and 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.910
 which also harms the gameplay harms 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.000
 this ours waiting for our 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.670
 experience with the game that how can you 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 how can we know what a bug is this 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 for example in this game 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.189
 in this case it is inscribed 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.869
 there are millions of good ebooks is not 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 true not millions but yes very many 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.560
 books and a book in this game is for 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 example that you kill an enemy in a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.020
 tree and it stays floating or even already 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.700
 it's happened to me that I'm swimming and I'm going 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.530
 coming out of the water and still swimming 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 even if it's on the ground, that 's a book, 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.720
 it's a not a cliche this there is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.340
 many books another book for example 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.390
 would be 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.300
 shit I know there's a poster 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.950
 another book would be 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.460
 inside some other game for example 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.009
 in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.110
 in big lack too many boxes 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.170
 or that then the cars disappear is 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.020
 a ship of this go for example with the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.740
 jetpack and see how the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.180
 buildings or that already has a building 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.260
 opposite disappears and reappears 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.930
 that's a bug that those flaws that look 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.580
 bad in a game are the bucs instead 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.170
 the glitch are also flaws in the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.410
 game are things that the developers 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.819
 they had not planned but they happen and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.310
 that this unlike the bug is that a 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.410
 Glitch is going to help you pass the game or 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.070
 It will help you as you play 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.970
 the game in right now for example a good 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.970
 glitch would be 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.160
 I dont know 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.910
 I do not remember but not if they saw a video 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 I saw it in 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.940
 a gamer page where they found a 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.300
 bridge 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.210
 in this in charly circus at the level of 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.090
 the balls where it has been a jump 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.560
 very precise that you were on the shore of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.390
 a ball you do not even get on the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.820
 ball that you hit on the edge of the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.760
 ball almost practically floating to a 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.410
 vertex of the ball and progressed without 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.590
 problems that will attack you that's a 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.690
 cliché a glitch is when you go by 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.970
 without you without it suffering a 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.680
 complication that is going to help you 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.730
 will help in a game error that you 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.650
 will help make it easier this 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.990
 it's a cliché and it's very different 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:44.330
 google is something that will hurt is going to 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.400
 out of control your gameplay goes 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.990
 make it look really bad you're going to have a 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.580
 bad game experience when you 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.400
 You encounter a bug in contrast with 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.590
 village you're going to have a great time this is 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.430
 an error but an error is good for you 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.990
 people then is something very very basic 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.930
 this of books and clips is very 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.790
 easy to identify when it's a cliché and 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.950
 now unister I've also seen that 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.440
 many people do not even use the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.240
 hysteria word to refer to this 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.000
 an internet is a part of the game 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.620
 secret that the developers know 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.780
 that is there they made them 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.730
 same but it's secret is it's not very 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.700
 easy to find 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.340
 a very easy example and that everyone knows 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.270
 to perfection is the part of mario 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.950
 bros del mario bros 1 alden is that in the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.230
 level 2 when you're going to finish it in place 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.600
 to go through the tube you go up 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.820
 you get to another 3 tubes where you 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.020
 they take nothing to certain worlds and obvious 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.920
 we all choose in a world 4 that's a 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.100
 provide that it is something that 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.960
 developments and developers did 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.670
 but that is hard to find because 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.300
 not everyone would have run by 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.670
 above 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.490
 well that's already very old but the 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.500
 beginning 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.960
 in the first years that the game came out 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.229
 I say that I did not live that time 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.830
 so I can not say much but that's 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.810
 a is a stress there is a lot of stress in 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.120
 almost any game the legend of zelda 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.870
 an alleged strike for me because it is not a 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.220
 mystery is very very very difficult but 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.770
 when you arrive with the princess zelda 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.430
 link's good actors link and you look 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.470
 to 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.630
 to one of the windows of rights to the 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.220
 window on the right you will find 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.680
 pictures of mario de mario I do not think so 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.750
 I did not remember I already had a lot with the game 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.080
 but that happens instead a un a 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.400
 mister is that if it's weirder because 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.210
 Well, not everyone would have 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.730
 happened is that a good following with 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.490
 the slingshot slingshot you hit the 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.140
 window to this one on the opposite side there in 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.860
 the same place where you find yourself doing 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:57.910
 cells this there they throw you a bomb and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.920
 for that is more plus be more than 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.300
 bragging with your friends do not work against 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.300
 this about your friends did not know him 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.120
 well in this more to show off 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.409
 this 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.469
 well, I think that would be all 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.469
 ah 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.520
 you invoke the one that affects you a cliché is 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.320
 sometimes good a ship is that mistake 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.480
 what a cliché affects you is that mistake 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.720
 that does not affect you that the opposite is going 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.080
 to benefit and unister axis is that 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.870
 that is hidden in the game that is the 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.350
 it was not an accident it was not an error but it is 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.230
 hidden 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.040
 and it would be all this I said no because he 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.120
 see rafael and sorry blair 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.389
 in your mistakes 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.330
 This is the task that I have left 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:47.120
 to read lean pages see with the 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.630
 gamers are going to see that there are many mistakes 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.690
 in our community so also 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:57.020
 you can go the learners would be 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:07:01.000
 great not today will not be everything after 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.000
 upload a next video until next time
