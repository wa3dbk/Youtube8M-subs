00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.929
 Hello guys 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.339
 this is the new glider cartridges 0 20k 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.509
 evolution of the black coach that we 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.610
 We know 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.770
 I will now show you a video 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.860
 very simple as this tool 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.890
 has evolved with the replacement of parliament 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.730
 today 50% higher than the previous 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.099
 shielded and with the solution cannula with 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.750
 greater diameter providing a 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.640
 much more efficient cleaning of the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.140
 tool as an example I will show this 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:45.600
 bank here it is quite dirty for you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 view the efficiency of the tool 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.409
 It is interesting to note that there 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.119
 big evolution in the cone part today 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.799
 teflon coated 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.310
 That's why we can visualize 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.380
 this much larger cloud of solution and 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.830
 cane when I talked to you here 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.049
 is a cannula close up 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.820
 it has a diameter larger than the model 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.460
 previous 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.090
 This allows the tool to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.679
 the pressure of six and a half bars 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.670
 provide a very large volume of solution 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.670
 great hygiene 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.510
 here is a complete visual of the tool 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.510
 for you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.690
 in function of these changes you 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 able to work with the new borrower 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 black cartridges and 0 20 with just 10 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.420
 compression feet 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.960
 You do not need a compressor anymore . 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.700
 20 feet as an actor in the previous black 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.270
 because it is much more economical in 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.970
 consumption and much more efficient in 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.160
 power of personal cleanliness because 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.630
 show you the difference of tornado 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.130
 the 2013 version is for the black taker 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.830
 traditional're 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.890
 It's two different players. Let's go. 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.820
 show you but it's the differences 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.240
 from one to the other, let's go there 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.440
 the difference that has 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.690
 between the two 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.240
 starts with the bearing size this 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:26.250
 2003 version a new trainer have a 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.900
 bearing greater than the coach brett 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.440
 old is starting in bearing size 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:38.100
 consequently a larger turn plus one 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.020
 ability and less air 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.560
 compressor we can work 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.190
 with a longer period than this one without 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.130
 drown the second difference compressor 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.640
 is in the second difference is in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.740
 curvature in size is a curvature in the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.260
 hose size 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.410
 and if from here it opens a larger fan than 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.680
 this one from here and if it opens a more 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.990
 directed straight and if that album 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.840
 a more open range is logical with 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.959
 one he opened a more open fan 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.720
 the cleaning power of it with the same 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.260
 wear the air and clean a larger area 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.280
 the product action is also highlighted is 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.120
 higher because it causes that due to 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.260
 While your hose is a little bit 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.200
 bigger 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.330
 the product comes out foamed the product comes out 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.689
 here you can see 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:48.539
 what the hose here is the hose 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:52.139
 here she is thicker grassi so much 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:56.280
 giving more life more durability is the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:05:00.210
 equipment is the difference of a little 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.580
 another summing up and becoming new pain him 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.879
 It will give more work action. 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.189
 give 25% greater work action and he 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.560
 will give greater durability to all 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:18.060
 components is the picture not giving 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:20.969
 a speed at work and a 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.860
 resistance in the tool and a 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.530
 tool resistance is the 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.440
 tool got sturdier 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.669
 robust with greater cleaning power're 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.669
 thank you very much
