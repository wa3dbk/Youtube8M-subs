00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.510
 so the technique with the left hand she 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.160
 would achieve the same result 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.139
 that in the right hand she is very much 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.639
 easier to learn but it is not 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.379
 not applicable in all cases you 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.660
 go quickly understand why the 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.610
 principle is extremely simple there you 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.150
 just touch all the strings with 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.189
 your fingers 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.240
 no need to press to put them from 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.279
 weird way you're just 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.170
 touch your strings with your fingers a 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.400
 once your fingers touch the strings 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.769
 all you have to do is 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.550
 normally scratch the right hand and that 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.320
 makes a block and ropes 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.940
 you can do it this time on 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 discovered the low or discovered the red 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.899
 whatever your hand does 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.219
 right unlocked small ropes 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.840
 detail that is important 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.520
 be sure to always touch 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.460
 ropes with as many fingers as possible 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.660
 minimum two fingers to make a blog 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.670
 a good block and ropes 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.739
 because if you only use one 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.609
 finger and you put it 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.719
 unfortunately in the wrong place 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.340
 you will have harmonics that's by 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.930
 a block and ropes if you do not know 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.129
 not what it is but harmonics on 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.440
 do not care for the moment 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.269
 just know that to avoid them he 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 just touch the strings with 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.540
 minimum of you so the more you have to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.759
 fingers on the strings better this is the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.439
 big concern of this technique is that 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.140
 if you do a rhythmic on 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.700
 open agreements for example a minor 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.870
 and you want to integrate blocks and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 strings in the rhythmic you go 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.740
 must pass of the minor 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 arabic which strings so break the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 cohesion of the minor to put all 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 fingers on the ropes and come back 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
 then on minors it's not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.509
 necessarily difficult to do but 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.390
 on more complicated agreements like a 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.549
 damage time when a single game it takes 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.869
 already more time and in addition if your 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.100
 rhythmic and fast you will never 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.360
 time to move blocks and ropes to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
 the agreement of the agreements of the agreement to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 blocks and ropes so it's basically 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.080
 this technique is not very 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.399
 usable with open agreements 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.340
 if you play open chords it is worth 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
 better do it with the right hand as 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.190
 we saw a previous part 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.420
 this technique in the left hand she has 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.800
 still a big advantage of a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 very practical use when one 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.490
 then crossed agreements made if you do 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.539
 do not know how to make strings 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.340
 it is not serious 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.989
 drop the rest of the video that does not 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.700
 you will be almost useless for 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.500
 the moment go to work your agreements 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.140
 crossed out once you are 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.420
 do them if you already know how to do your 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.530
 barred chords then you know without 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 doubt that when one makes a bar and one 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.140
 often goes five or six strings on 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.709
 the handle for example agen d minor in 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.540
 breaks 5 oz's rope made 500 7 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.150
 6 5 and grants half serious that one plays 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.989
 not and that we block with the index 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.030
 technically you know how to do it if 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.440
 you made barrel and low chords 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.329
 which is very interesting and that this 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.709
 left there is that if I'm happy with 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.989
 release your fingers with your left hand 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.570
 without removing them from the ropes and ba all 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.730
 my strings are blocked so it's very 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.280
 easy to have fast rhythmics or 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.290
 same quick name on barred chords and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.560
 2 to integrate blocks and rope there 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.970
 in 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.500
 since it is enough to release the pressure 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.269
 fingers and rats then there is just 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.140
 afterwards when we do it we can 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.140
 make rhythmic interesting 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.270
 what is to note is that the hand 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.920
 right she's doing exactly the same 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.340
 rhythmic that if you were not doing 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.340
 beauty of strings 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.140
 at first I was not thinking sorry 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.000
 everything that happens at the level of 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.489
 left hand that will sync with 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.830
 the pace to successfully release the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.910
 press and press when needed by 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.190
 example you can train in 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680
 simply making a right to discover 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.080
 pao pao pao for you and by hand 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.250
 left you will press once all 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.630
 the four shots for example after you 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.180
 can press once both 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.880
 blows or so you can press 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.290
 for two shots so bao then after 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.430
 blocked during baous to the next and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 you can do all kinds of 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.160
 combinations like that and obviously we 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.510
 can do that these are real 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.500
 rhythmic where you do not play every 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.140
 shots on the right hand 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.150
 the principle is so simple we have 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.780
 a bar and we release the pressure that 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.810
 blocks the strings 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.860
 we support it redoes the bar and we can 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.299
 fuck blocks and ropes in 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.690
 all our rhythms we want so 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.530
 pretty easy that's all that 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.600
 I have to say on the left hand 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.760
 we can simply plate all 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.410
 fingers and eventually this park has ranged 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.070
 open agreements where iron with the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.150
 bars and very easy and effective way 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.400
 so bring you of course all that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.440
 go slowly at first do it well 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.090
 watch out for the cleanliness you really need 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.979
 that all the strings are blocked on 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.050
 never wants a dragging finger who 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.120
 kiabi on a tightrope worried about 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.640
 strings it's naze it's no separable 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.390
 four strings 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.560
 practice then take the 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.580
 rhythmic that you want and put 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.960
 riots and ropes in that this 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.910
 are bars and chords open to the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.780
 right hand left hand does all that 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.430
 you want 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.710
 become crazy experienced as long as you 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.300
 want and then like that you can 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.070
 quite do your own techniques 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.030
 thereafter in so-so pieces 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.550
 to make them a little bit more 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.419
 interesting about this I leave you I 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.370
