00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
very effective counter into my toxic

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920 
very effective counter into my toxic
work<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.920> decided<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.540> sucker

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
work so I decided to go for the sucker

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.570

punch

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
punch

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.520 
punch
I<00:01:41.610> broke<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> substitute<00:01:42.870> but<00:01:43.230> he<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.910 

finally<00:01:47.250> disable<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:48.079> sucker<00:01:49.079> punch<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
finally disable my sucker punch so now I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800 
finally disable my sucker punch so now I
can<00:01:50.189> literally<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.909> nothing<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.600> game

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
can literally do nothing to this game

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
can literally do nothing to this game
there<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.289> site<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> switch<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
