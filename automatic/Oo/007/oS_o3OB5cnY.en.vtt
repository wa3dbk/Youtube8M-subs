okay<00:01:03.400> I<00:01:03.430> cut<00:01:03.700> out<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.910> an<00:01:03.970> old<00:01:04.090> 2x4<00:01:04.660> these<00:01:04.870> sort

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
okay I cut out of an old 2x4 these sort

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.060 
okay I cut out of an old 2x4 these sort
of<00:01:05.490> generic<00:01:06.490> shapes<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:07.030> spikes<00:01:07.900> pause<00:01:08.230> we're

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
of generic shapes of spikes pause we're

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.190 
of generic shapes of spikes pause we're
going<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.280> make<00:01:09.400> two<00:01:09.580> puppet<00:01:09.970> paws<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.960> are

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
going to make two puppet paws that are

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
going to make two puppet paws that are
going<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.380> be<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> opening<00:01:11.950> sequence<00:01:12.400> for<00:01:12.460> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
going to be the opening sequence for the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530 
going to be the opening sequence for the
bends<00:01:13.750> or<00:01:13.990> video<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.040> I<00:01:15.580> made<00:01:16.030> these<00:01:16.150> posts<00:01:16.480> so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
bends or video and I made these posts so

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.850 
bends or video and I made these posts so
that<00:01:16.690> they<00:01:16.810> pivot<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.230> little<00:01:17.260> bit<00:01:17.530> right<00:01:17.650> here

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
that they pivot a little bit right here

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.860 
that they pivot a little bit right here
and<00:01:18.040> just<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.700> get<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> quick<00:01:19.090> spring-loaded

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
and just to get a quick spring-loaded

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.060 
and just to get a quick spring-loaded
hinge<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.440> I'm<00:01:20.560> going<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.740> use<00:01:20.860> this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
hinge and I'm going to use this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.840 
hinge and I'm going to use this
polypropylene<00:01:21.790> cup<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:24.040> might<00:01:24.580> be<00:01:24.700> too

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
polypropylene cup which might be too

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.820 
polypropylene cup which might be too
brittle<00:01:25.090> but<00:01:25.240> we'll<00:01:25.390> see<00:01:25.540> in<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> minute<00:01:31.830> so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
brittle but we'll see in a minute so

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.670 
brittle but we'll see in a minute so
there<00:01:33.010> I<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.930> spring<00:01:34.930> action<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.350> can<00:01:35.380> put

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
there I have a spring action I can put

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.570 
there I have a spring action I can put
on<00:01:39.600> hot<00:01:40.600> glue<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:40.869> going<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.460> change<00:01:42.460> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
on hot glue is going to change the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190 
on hot glue is going to change the
integrity<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.060> plastic<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.600> little<00:01:43.630> bit<00:01:43.990> but

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
integrity the plastic a little bit but

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.340 
integrity the plastic a little bit but
as<00:01:44.320> long<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.680> wait<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.070> let<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.280> cool<00:01:46.350> we're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
as long as I wait and let it cool we're

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.469 
as long as I wait and let it cool we're
going<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.530> have<00:01:47.650> sort<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.580> makeshift<00:01:48.910> cables

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
going to have sort of makeshift cables

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.290 
going to have sort of makeshift cables
and<00:01:50.440> a<00:01:50.590> trigger<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.979> be<00:01:51.190> able<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.369> pull<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
and a trigger to be able to pull the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.300 
and a trigger to be able to pull the
paws<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.580> what<00:01:55.000> position<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:57.070> there<00:01:57.220> we

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
paws to the in what position so there we

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.460 
paws to the in what position so there we
have<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.429> quick<00:01:57.610> spring-loaded

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
have a quick spring-loaded

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.830 
have a quick spring-loaded
puppet<00:01:59.470> hand<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.880> next<00:02:01.390> I'm<00:02:01.509> going<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.720> put<00:02:01.810> a

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
puppet hand now next I'm going to put a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.999 
puppet hand now next I'm going to put a
little<00:02:01.990> cable<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.560> inside<00:02:02.830> with<00:02:02.979> a

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
little cable on the inside with a

00:02:03.009 --> 00:03:27.890 
little cable on the inside with a
trigger<00:02:03.280> here<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.640> will<00:02:03.729> pull<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.030> point

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.240 

these<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:29.050> gonna<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.320> our<00:03:29.350> ligaments<00:03:29.920> we'll

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
these are gonna be our ligaments we'll

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.920 
these are gonna be our ligaments we'll
see<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.490> they<00:03:30.610> work<00:03:31.740> side<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.040> their<00:03:33.930> zip

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
see if they work side it in their zip

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:49.730 
see if they work side it in their zip
strips<00:03:47.820> never<00:03:48.820> mind

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
strips never mind

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.290 
strips never mind
these<00:03:50.740> just<00:03:51.010> broke<00:03:51.220> off<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.670> put<00:03:51.940> some<00:03:51.970> holes

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
these just broke off so I put some holes

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.360 
these just broke off so I put some holes
through<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:54.300> styrene<00:03:55.300> Cup<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.650> now<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.310> will

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
through the styrene Cup and now it will

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.010 
through the styrene Cup and now it will
pop<00:03:57.610> through<00:03:57.820> like<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> rivet<00:03:58.870> right

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
pop through like a like a rivet right

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.260 
pop through like a like a rivet right
there<00:03:59.290> so<00:03:59.500> that'll<00:03:59.680> be<00:03:59.860> good<00:03:59.910> it'll<00:04:00.910> hold<00:04:01.090> much

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
there so that'll be good it'll hold much

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:10.290 
there so that'll be good it'll hold much
stronger<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:09.610> here's<00:04:09.760> our<00:04:09.880> ligaments

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
stronger so here's our ligaments

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.790 
stronger so here's our ligaments
connected<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.840> paw<00:04:11.020> goes<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.470> through<00:04:11.710> the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
connected to the paw goes up through the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.560 
connected to the paw goes up through the
arm<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.130> back<00:04:12.370> down<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.090> inside<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.510> the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
arm and back down to the inside of the

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.050 
arm and back down to the inside of the
arm<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.870> switch<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.530> curve

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
arm to the switch and that curve

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
arm to the switch and that curve
eliminates<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.180> lot<00:04:16.210> of<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.540> potential

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
eliminates a lot of the potential

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.010 
eliminates a lot of the potential
friction<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.160> let's<00:04:18.420> glue<00:04:19.420> this<00:04:19.450> in<00:04:19.780> place<00:04:19.989> and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
friction so let's glue this in place and

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.440 
friction so let's glue this in place and
see<00:04:20.470> if<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.680> works

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.910 

hot<00:04:25.450> glue<00:04:25.600> doesn't<00:04:25.870> stick<00:04:26.020> very<00:04:26.470> well<00:04:26.590> to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
hot glue doesn't stick very well to

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.040 
hot glue doesn't stick very well to
polypropylene<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:28.090> might<00:04:28.600> have<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.780> drill<00:04:29.020> a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
polypropylene so I might have to drill a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:42.960 
polypropylene so I might have to drill a
little<00:04:29.230> hole<00:04:29.350> through<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:41.470> we<00:04:41.560> got<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.940> got<00:04:42.940> a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
little hole through it so we got a got a

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.909 
little hole through it so we got a got a
cat<00:04:43.240> paws

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:06:42.800 

hot<00:04:46.610> glue<00:04:46.879> and<00:04:47.060> plastic<00:04:47.539> zip<00:04:47.810> ties<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.259> wood

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.870
