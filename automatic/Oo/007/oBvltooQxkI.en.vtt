plants<00:00:00.390> need<00:00:00.450> light<00:00:00.599> to<00:00:00.840> grow<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.159> know

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
plants need light to grow this we know

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.490 
plants need light to grow this we know
plants<00:00:02.909> use<00:00:03.060> light<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.419> turn<00:00:03.540> co2<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.319> h2o

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
plants use light to turn co2 and h2o

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.260 
plants use light to turn co2 and h2o
into<00:00:05.100> sugar<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.759> process<00:00:06.120> called

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
into sugar in a process called

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.419 
into sugar in a process called
photosynthesis<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.350> plants<00:00:08.010> then<00:00:08.130> use<00:00:08.309> this

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
photosynthesis and plants then use this

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.310 
photosynthesis and plants then use this
sugar<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> grow<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.300> many<00:00:09.540> plants<00:00:09.900> try<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
sugar to grow so many plants try and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.720 
sugar to grow so many plants try and
maximize<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.010> amount<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.280> light<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.460> they

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
maximize the amount of light that they

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.220 
maximize the amount of light that they
get<00:00:11.880> some<00:00:12.300> plants<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.840> by<00:00:12.990> growing

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
get some plants do this by growing

bigger leaves other plants do it by

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
bigger leaves other plants do it by

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
demonstration purposes let me introduce

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.970 
demonstration purposes let me introduce
you<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.460> my<00:00:26.849> basil<00:00:27.300> plant<00:00:27.800> he's<00:00:29.119> little<00:00:30.119> sad

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
you to my basil plant he's little sad

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
you to my basil plant he's little sad
sometimes<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.099> forget<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> water<00:00:32.610> him<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sometimes I forget to water him if you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.049 
sometimes I forget to water him if you
notice<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.620> leaves<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.950> facing<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.520> one

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
notice all the leaves are facing in one

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
notice all the leaves are facing in one
direction<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
direction and it's because this is the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
direction and it's because this is the
side<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> plant<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:38.940> windowsill<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
side of the plant on my windowsill that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
side of the plant on my windowsill that
faces<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> window<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.129> plant<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.760> bent

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
faces the window the plant is so bent

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
faces the window the plant is so bent
towards<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> sunlight<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
towards the sunlight that some of the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
towards the sunlight that some of the
leaves<00:00:44.129> even<00:00:44.370> press<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.120> against<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
leaves even press right up against the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
leaves even press right up against the
glass<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:46.800> an<00:00:46.890> experiment<00:00:47.160> turn<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
glass so if we do an experiment turn the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.310 
glass so if we do an experiment turn the
plant<00:00:48.090> around<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.510> leave<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.140> little

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
plant around and leave it for a little

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
plant around and leave it for a little
while<00:00:49.850> over<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> course<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> few<00:00:51.420> days<00:00:51.539> this

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
while over the course of a few days this

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.330 
while over the course of a few days this
pretty<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.289> plant<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.920> changed<00:00:53.219> its

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
pretty little plant actually changed its

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.260 
pretty little plant actually changed its
direction<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.699> growth<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.180> was

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
direction of growth so that it was

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.880 
direction of growth so that it was
facing<00:00:54.600> towards<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> sunlight<00:00:55.140> again<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
facing towards the sunlight again this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
facing towards the sunlight again this
is<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.190> example<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.670> positive<00:00:57.210> phototropism

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is an example of positive phototropism

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
is an example of positive phototropism
because<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> plant<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.530> growing<00:00:58.710> towards

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
because the plant was growing towards

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
because the plant was growing towards
the<00:00:59.309> light<00:00:59.489> plants<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> hormone<00:01:00.780> called

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the light plants use a hormone called

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
the light plants use a hormone called
oxen<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> sort<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.039> directional<00:01:02.609> growth

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
oxen for this sort of directional growth

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
oxen for this sort of directional growth
plants<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.660> hormones<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.199> growth<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
plants use hormones for growth and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
plants use hormones for growth and
maturation<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.790> animals<00:01:06.210> didn't<00:01:06.900> know

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
maturation much like animals didn't know

maturation much like animals didn't know
plants<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.350> hormones<00:01:07.740> well<00:01:08.130> you've

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
plants had hormones well you've
