00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.480
 student representative to the council 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.309
 university higher education 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.620
 national and I want to tell you in three 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.389
 minutes the topics covered in the last 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 council session that took place 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.520
 last May 3 are three things 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.439
 punctually the first one was talked about 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.910
 the financial regime a proposal that 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.289
 wants to present the administration for 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.990
 recentralize resources even more 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.730
 removing autonomy to faculties and 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.949
 participation of university community 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.410
 in particular teachers and students 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.180
 an issue that concerns us all, given that 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.260
 We are talking about the management of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.720
 finances in income the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.610
 university being an ideal mechanism 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.950
 to combat corruption dynamics the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.540
 democratic participation 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.840
 university in decision making 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.820
 the second topic I want to mention is how 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.620
 everyone knows the dean of the faculty 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.980
 of veterinary medicine and zootechnics 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.440
 submits his resignation this resignation is not 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.750
 accepted by the superior council 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.670
 but agreements are reached between the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.760
 decanatura and the vice-rectory of headquarters 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.930
 agreements that go to strengthen 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.700
 the issue of university welfare 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.789
 academic quality the management of marengo 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.409
 of the research spaces and 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.610
 training of the students of the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.159
 faculty of veterinary medicine and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.310
 zootechnics in addition to a serious study 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.890
 for the management of the list institute the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.509
 which we say has generated discussions in 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.860
 the faculties of both science 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.670
 agrarian as veterinary medicine I 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.049
 I think it is necessary that the community 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.179
 university is wisdom and be 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.009
 pending of these subjects that guarantees 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.399
 that will guarantee the proper functioning 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.759
 of the faculty mentioned and finally 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.599
 mention that it is for the designation 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.610
 by the Board of Governors 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.310
 university of the deans for the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.929
 first week of June and prior 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.579
 query that is going to be carried out in the 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.890
 this week in the 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.970
 national university the position that goes 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 to bring the student representation 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.720
 is that this query that the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.959
 university community should be of 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.360
 binding nature is to say those 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.730
 people who are 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.369
 those that get the most votes in those 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.730
 queries are what should be for 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.130
 democracies defined as deans to 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.260
 inside the university in that 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.440
 mentioned consultation although we understand 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.820
 that this query is not does not solve the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 democracy theme the inside of the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.020
 university if it is important to advance in 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.270
 this matter for that from the committee 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.730
 national student representatives 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.840
 we have insisted on the strength of the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.270
 democracy inside the university 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.130
 and in collaboration with teachers and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.900
 workers, we have made progress in the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.420
 configuration of a proposal that is the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.520
 university congress with a view to 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.020
 generate spaces for participation and take 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.850
 of decision where the community 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.830
 university is really had in 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.390
 finally the national government 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.739
 announced that it is resubmitting the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.110
 reform to higher education that 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.700
 tried to present in the year 2011 and with 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.320
 which has advanced in the privatization 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.310
 of the university and that fortunately 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.739
 was defeated by the movement 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.900
 student teachers and workers is 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.310
 necessary to recover the inputs that 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.290
 we build from the wide table 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.810
 national student 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.670
 and advance in character defense 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.829
 public of the national university of 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.829
 Colombia its autonomy and democracy
