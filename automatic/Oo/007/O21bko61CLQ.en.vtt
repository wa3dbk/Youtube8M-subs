00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
ulna and that all led us to looking for

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.330 
ulna and that all led us to looking for
more<00:00:49.360> pieces<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:49.930> this<00:00:50.410> individual<00:00:50.980> because

more pieces of this individual because
what<00:00:51.520> we<00:00:51.640> found<00:00:51.820> at<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.210> beginning<00:00:52.540> was<00:00:52.720> just

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
what we found at the beginning was just

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.790 
what we found at the beginning was just
the<00:00:53.280> proximal<00:00:54.280> half<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.730> this<00:00:55.350> arm<00:00:56.350> ball<00:00:56.620> or

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
the proximal half of this arm ball or

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.930 
the proximal half of this arm ball or
arm<00:00:57.010> bone<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.489> further<00:00:59.190> search<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.610> area

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
arm bone and further search in the area

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.649 
arm bone and further search in the area
produced<00:01:01.540> more<00:01:01.780> pieces<00:01:02.290> of<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.950> shaft<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.659> we

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
produced more pieces of the shaft and we

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.319 
produced more pieces of the shaft and we
also<00:01:04.839> found<00:01:05.250> why<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:06.460> were<00:01:06.549> finding<00:01:06.820> this<00:01:07.119> we

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
also found why we were finding this we

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.730 
also found why we were finding this we
also<00:01:07.509> found<00:01:07.780> some<00:01:08.729> bones<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.180> Nick<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
also found some bones of the Nick and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.950 
also found some bones of the Nick and
also<00:01:12.100> some<00:01:12.340> fragments<00:01:12.940> of<00:01:13.090> other<00:01:13.299> elements<00:01:13.540> so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
also some fragments of other elements so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.670 
also some fragments of other elements so
that<00:01:13.990> led<00:01:14.799> us<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.640> major<00:01:16.540> excavation<00:01:16.930> which

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
that led us to a major excavation which

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.930 
that led us to a major excavation which
took<00:01:18.280> about<00:01:19.060> five<00:01:19.420> years<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.430> age<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.760> this

so what it tells us that all our

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.130 
so what it tells us that all our
understanding<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.739> Lucy's<00:02:27.280> species<00:02:28.150> movement

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
understanding of Lucy's species movement

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.690 
understanding of Lucy's species movement
and<00:02:29.319> locomotion<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:31.360> wrong<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:32.830> all<00:02:33.370> we

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
and locomotion was wrong because all we

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.600 
and locomotion was wrong because all we
depended<00:02:34.209> on<00:02:34.360> was<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.290> Lucy<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.250> fact<00:02:36.519> that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
depended on was on Lucy the fact that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.960 
depended on was on Lucy the fact that
she<00:02:36.730> was<00:02:36.970> small<00:02:37.450> she<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> female<00:02:38.500> had<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.670> lot

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
she was small she was a female had a lot

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.460 
she was small she was a female had a lot
of<00:02:40.000> impact<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> way<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.019> thought<00:02:41.349> about

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
of impact on the way we thought about

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.400 
of impact on the way we thought about
how<00:02:41.950> long<00:02:42.310> leg<00:02:43.150> bones<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.629> our<00:02:43.750> friends<00:02:44.080> could

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
how long leg bones of our friends could

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.039 
how long leg bones of our friends could
be<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.579> know<00:02:45.730> how<00:02:45.760> advanced<00:02:46.629> they<00:02:46.840> could

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
be how you know how advanced they could

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.830 
be how you know how advanced they could
be<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.290> terms<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.680> their<00:02:47.920> hip<00:02:48.819> bone<00:02:49.150> morphology

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
be in terms of their hip bone morphology

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.289 
be in terms of their hip bone morphology
so<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.470> guy<00:02:50.680> has<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:51.129> combination<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:51.970> all<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
so this guy has a combination of all the

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.690 
so this guy has a combination of all the
characters<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:53.019> we<00:02:53.620> really<00:02:54.010> expect<00:02:54.459> in

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
characters that we really expect in

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.900 
characters that we really expect in
finding<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.540> know<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.079> fully<00:02:56.349> bipedal

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
finding you know in a fully bipedal

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.229 
finding you know in a fully bipedal
individual<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.650> he<00:02:59.650> tells<00:02:59.920> out<00:03:00.129> that<00:03:00.370> Lucy

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
individual so he tells out that Lucy

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.140 
individual so he tells out that Lucy
species<00:03:01.599> are<00:03:01.690> salty<00:03:01.959> because<00:03:02.049> references<00:03:02.680> was

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
species are salty because references was

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.910 
species are salty because references was
totally<00:03:04.150> fully<00:03:04.420> bipedal<00:03:04.870> as<00:03:05.140> much<00:03:05.560> as<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:05.890> are

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
totally fully bipedal as much as we are

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.119 
totally fully bipedal as much as we are
today<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.269> notion<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.810> her<00:03:08.470> elusive

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
today so the notion of her elusive

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.400 
today so the notion of her elusive
species<00:03:09.340> being<00:03:09.700> he<00:03:09.970> now<00:03:10.120> whitley<00:03:10.900> walking<00:03:11.260> on

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
species being he now whitley walking on

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.589 
species being he now whitley walking on
two<00:03:11.590> legs<00:03:11.620> when<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.129> ground<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.730> sort<00:03:13.480> of

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
two legs when on the ground is sort of

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.619 
two legs when on the ground is sort of
falsified<00:03:14.170> technically<00:03:14.920> by<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.730> large

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
falsified technically by this large

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.550 
falsified technically by this large
individual<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.489> have<00:03:18.640> an<00:03:18.760> individual

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
individual here we have an individual

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.550 
individual here we have an individual
who<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.590> much<00:03:20.829> larger<00:03:21.069> than<00:03:21.280> Lucy<00:03:21.959> not<00:03:22.959> only<00:03:23.319> is

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
who is much larger than Lucy not only is

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.370 
who is much larger than Lucy not only is
he<00:03:23.620> much<00:03:24.430> larger<00:03:24.669> than<00:03:24.880> Lucy<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:25.810> he<00:03:25.959> also<00:03:26.109> has

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
he much larger than Lucy but he also has

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.909 
he much larger than Lucy but he also has
elements<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:27.519> were<00:03:27.669> not<00:03:27.849> known<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.180> Lucy

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
elements that were not known for Lucy

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.720 
elements that were not known for Lucy
for<00:03:29.919> example<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.739> clavicle<00:03:33.310> which<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.609> the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
for example the clavicle which is the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.240 
for example the clavicle which is the
collarbone<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.889> most<00:03:36.040> complete

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
collarbone this is the most complete

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.370 
collarbone this is the most complete
collarbone<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.030> has<00:03:37.389> ever<00:03:37.690> been<00:03:37.780> found<00:03:37.959> in

the human fossil record and in addition

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.400 
the human fossil record and in addition
to<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.280> corner<00:03:42.639> bond<00:03:42.849> we<00:03:43.750> have<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.049> shoulder

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
to the corner bond we have the shoulder

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.180 
to the corner bond we have the shoulder
blade<00:03:44.940> which<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.349> one<00:03:47.349> of<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.620> most<00:03:47.769> complete

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190

shoulder blades ever found in the fossil

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.650 
shoulder blades ever found in the fossil
record<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:51.400> what<00:03:51.669> did<00:03:51.849> we<00:03:52.000> know<00:03:52.150> about<00:03:52.269> the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
record now what did we know about the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.440 
record now what did we know about the
shoulder<00:03:52.870> blade<00:03:53.200> morphology<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:53.889> Lucy<00:03:54.310> now<00:03:55.180> if

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
shoulder blade morphology of Lucy now if

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.750 
shoulder blade morphology of Lucy now if
we<00:03:55.599> look<00:03:55.630> at<00:03:55.930> what<00:03:56.560> we<00:03:56.709> know<00:03:56.980> what<00:03:57.459> we<00:03:57.519> knew

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
we look at what we know what we knew

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.690 
we look at what we know what we knew
from<00:03:57.940> Lucy<00:03:58.829> which<00:03:59.829> I<00:03:59.980> have<00:04:00.069> a<00:04:00.130> specimen<00:04:00.519> of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
from Lucy which I have a specimen of

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.420 
from Lucy which I have a specimen of
here<00:04:01.000> that's<00:04:01.540> Lucy<00:04:01.840> scapula<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.919> is<00:04:03.069> all<00:04:03.250> we

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
here that's Lucy scapula this is all we

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.960 
here that's Lucy scapula this is all we
had<00:04:03.639> from<00:04:04.030> Lucy<00:04:04.419> now<00:04:04.989> that's<00:04:05.829> part<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.669> you

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
had from Lucy now that's part of you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.729 
had from Lucy now that's part of you
know<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.510> what<00:04:07.810> we<00:04:07.930> call<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.230> glenoid<00:04:08.470> fossa

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
know the what we call the glenoid fossa

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.220 
know the what we call the glenoid fossa
this<00:04:09.099> is<00:04:09.190> where<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.549> upper<00:04:10.150> arm<00:04:10.359> rests<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.019> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
this is where the upper arm rests on the

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.640 
this is where the upper arm rests on the
shoulder<00:04:11.829> blade<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.599> size-wise<00:04:13.599> you<00:04:14.500> can

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
shoulder blade and size-wise you can

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.140 
shoulder blade and size-wise you can
actually<00:04:14.799> see<00:04:15.040> how<00:04:15.280> different<00:04:15.489> they<00:04:15.790> are<00:04:15.819> this

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
actually see how different they are this

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.990 
actually see how different they are this
is<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:16.449> tiny<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.530> everything<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.669> try<00:04:18.940> to

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
is so tiny so everything that we try to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.509 
is so tiny so everything that we try to
interpret<00:04:19.570> on<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.440> shoulder<00:04:20.799> morphology<00:04:21.489> of

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
interpret on the shoulder morphology of

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.700 
interpret on the shoulder morphology of
Australopithecus<00:04:22.330> afarensis<00:04:22.630> was<00:04:23.110> based<00:04:23.440> on

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
Australopithecus afarensis was based on

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.420 
Australopithecus afarensis was based on
this<00:04:23.949> piece<00:04:24.660> which<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.690> one<00:04:26.440> very<00:04:26.919> tiny<00:04:27.250> very

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
this piece which is one very tiny very

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.450 
this piece which is one very tiny very
small<00:04:27.969> and<00:04:28.349> secondly<00:04:29.349> it<00:04:29.620> doesn't<00:04:30.010> have<00:04:30.219> as

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
small and secondly it doesn't have as

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.250 
small and secondly it doesn't have as
much<00:04:30.969> information

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
much information

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.410 
much information
we<00:04:32.440> want<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.920> understand<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.640> morphology<00:04:34.390> of

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
we want to understand the morphology of

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.630 
we want to understand the morphology of
the<00:04:34.630> shoulder<00:04:34.990> girdle<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.470> also<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.340> joint

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
the shoulder girdle and also the joint

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.670 
the shoulder girdle and also the joint
with<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.480> upper<00:04:37.750> arm<00:04:37.900> so<00:04:38.080> here<00:04:38.320> we<00:04:38.470> have<00:04:38.500> a

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
with the upper arm so here we have a

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.530 
with the upper arm so here we have a
complete<00:04:39.070> scapula<00:04:39.610> which<00:04:39.790> tells<00:04:40.150> us<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.390> lot

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
complete scapula which tells us a lot

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.350 
complete scapula which tells us a lot
about<00:04:40.750> what<00:04:41.380> it<00:04:41.500> looks<00:04:41.680> like<00:04:42.000> because<00:04:43.000> people

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
about what it looks like because people

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.240 
about what it looks like because people
based<00:04:43.570> on<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.930> one<00:04:44.200> has<00:04:44.530> interpreted<00:04:44.920> this

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
based on this one has interpreted this

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.490 
based on this one has interpreted this
to<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.610> more<00:04:45.880> ape-like<00:04:46.810> than<00:04:47.380> human-like<00:04:48.330> but

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
to be more ape-like than human-like but

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.640 
to be more ape-like than human-like but
when<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.620> look<00:04:50.800> at<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.220> lot<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.270> smaller<00:04:52.840> modern

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
when you look at a lot of smaller modern

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.710 
when you look at a lot of smaller modern
human<00:04:53.890> individuals<00:04:54.520> we<00:04:55.060> were<00:04:55.180> actually<00:04:55.330> able

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
human individuals we were actually able

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.160 
human individuals we were actually able
to<00:04:55.870> match<00:04:56.260> this<00:04:56.770> with<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.340> modern<00:04:57.760> human<00:04:58.090> in<00:04:58.990> the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
to match this with a modern human in the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.310 
to match this with a modern human in the
old<00:04:59.350> days<00:04:59.440> we<00:04:59.830> always<00:05:00.190> thought<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:01.320> the

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
old days we always thought that the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.490 
old days we always thought that the
elongation<00:05:02.980> of<00:05:03.100> our<00:05:03.280> legs<00:05:03.780> came<00:05:04.780> later<00:05:05.140> in<00:05:05.380> our

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
elongation of our legs came later in our

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.680 
elongation of our legs came later in our
evolution<00:05:06.100> probably<00:05:06.760> with<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.180> advent<00:05:07.450> of

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
evolution probably with the advent of

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.540 
evolution probably with the advent of
the<00:05:07.810> genus<00:05:08.020> Homo<00:05:08.350> which<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.710> our<00:05:08.860> our<00:05:09.160> own

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
the genus Homo which is our our own

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.670 
the genus Homo which is our our own
genus<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.350> that's<00:05:11.350> because<00:05:11.800> we<00:05:12.130> like<00:05:12.910> apes

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
genus and that's because we like apes

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.560 
genus and that's because we like apes
the<00:05:14.680> belief<00:05:15.040> was<00:05:15.190> that<00:05:15.250> our<00:05:15.730> arms<00:05:16.120> were<00:05:16.270> still

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
the belief was that our arms were still

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.350 
the belief was that our arms were still
much<00:05:16.780> longer<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.530> our<00:05:18.490> legs<00:05:18.730> were<00:05:18.970> shorter

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
much longer and our legs were shorter

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.570 
much longer and our legs were shorter
and<00:05:19.540> that's<00:05:20.530> exactly<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.130> impression<00:05:21.550> that

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
and that's exactly the impression that

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.910 
and that's exactly the impression that
Lucy<00:05:22.210> gave<00:05:22.240> us<00:05:22.570> because<00:05:22.900> Lucy<00:05:23.230> because<00:05:23.680> she<00:05:23.860> is

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
Lucy gave us because Lucy because she is

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.390 
Lucy gave us because Lucy because she is
tiny<00:05:24.220> her<00:05:25.060> legs<00:05:25.270> are<00:05:25.390> also<00:05:25.600> tiny<00:05:26.310> but<00:05:27.310> the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
tiny her legs are also tiny but the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.790 
tiny her legs are also tiny but the
whole<00:05:27.520> point<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.910> if<00:05:28.120> if<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:29.020> had<00:05:29.140> to<00:05:29.380> let<00:05:29.560> if

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
whole point is if if you had to let if

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.500 
whole point is if if you had to let if
he<00:05:30.760> made<00:05:31.000> Lucy<00:05:31.540> as<00:05:31.750> big<00:05:32.470> as<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:32.800> individual

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
he made Lucy as big as this individual

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.320 
he made Lucy as big as this individual
Alex<00:05:34.510> would<00:05:34.690> also<00:05:34.840> be<00:05:35.140> long
