basically I was told a few of the
YouTube<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.549> guys<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> turn<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
YouTube and guys that if you turn the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.130

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.010 
head the other way the helmet and it
sits<00:01:11.040> properly<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.390> doesn't<00:01:12.869> fall<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
sits properly and doesn't fall off so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.010 
sits properly and doesn't fall off so
which<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.470> idea<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.450> obviously<00:01:18.450> yeah

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
which was a good idea and obviously yeah

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.640 
which was a good idea and obviously yeah

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
helmet on it's pretty loose like that

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
helmet on it's pretty loose like that
let<00:01:35.729> me<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:35.970> pull<00:01:36.150> off<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.900> turn

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

his<00:01:37.920> head<00:01:38.100> around<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> helmet<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:44.220> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
his head around the helmet and it's on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
his head around the helmet and it's on
there<00:01:44.520> nice<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> tightly<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
there nice and tightly so it doesn't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.149 
there nice and tightly so it doesn't
fall<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:47.030> they<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.829> good<00:01:50.040> idea

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
fall off they it's a pretty good idea

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
fall off they it's a pretty good idea
because<00:01:50.880> always<00:01:51.210> having<00:01:51.360> trouble<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.840> these

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
because always having trouble with these

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
because always having trouble with these
helmet<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.860> didn't<00:01:53.159> look<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.729> now

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
helmet just didn't look right but now

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.999 
helmet just didn't look right but now
looks<00:01:54.149> perfect

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
looks perfect

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.660 
looks perfect
though<00:01:57.500> obviously<00:01:58.500> he<00:01:59.009> comes<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
though obviously he comes with the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.040 
though obviously he comes with the
standard

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
standard

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.650 
standard
blaster<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.670> stormtroopers<00:02:04.390> carry

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
blaster which all stormtroopers carry

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.240 
blaster which all stormtroopers carry
might<00:02:05.350> say<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.630> mine<00:02:07.870> keeps<00:02:08.140> falling<00:02:08.380> fallen

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
might say but mine keeps falling fallen

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.140 
might say but mine keeps falling fallen
off<00:02:09.400> so<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:11.280> want<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.340> whack<00:02:12.490> it<00:02:12.520> back<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.940> there

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
off so I want to whack it back in there

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.990 
off so I want to whack it back in there
so<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:15.070> pretty<00:02:15.280> cool<00:02:15.520> figure<00:02:15.820> this<00:02:15.940> one<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
so it's pretty cool figure this one and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
so it's pretty cool figure this one and
it's<00:02:19.530> another<00:02:20.530> addition<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.040> my<00:02:21.370> ever-growing

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it's another addition to my ever-growing

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.630 
it's another addition to my ever-growing
stormtrooper<00:02:23.020> legion<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:26.250> I'm<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.460> real

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
stormtrooper legion but I'm not real

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.240 
stormtrooper legion but I'm not real
keen<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.210> removable<00:02:28.720> helmets<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.470> I'm

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
keen on the removable helmets but I'm

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.420 
keen on the removable helmets but I'm
turning<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.970> head<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.450> opposite<00:02:31.870> way<00:02:32.430> at

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
turning the head the opposite way at

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.010 
turning the head the opposite way at
least<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.820> helmet<00:02:34.180> stays<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.660> there<00:02:34.840> properly

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
least the helmet stays on there properly

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.400 
least the helmet stays on there properly
so<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.140> pretty<00:02:38.380> cool<00:02:38.470> figure<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> time

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
so it's a pretty cool figure the time

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.620 
so it's a pretty cool figure the time
and<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> movement<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.400> pretty<00:02:42.730> good<00:02:42.940> I'm<00:02:43.570> not

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
and the movement is pretty good I'm not

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.790 
and the movement is pretty good I'm not
the<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.380> arms<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.130> legs<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:47.200> some<00:02:47.320> reason

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
the the arms the legs for some reason

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.970 
the the arms the legs for some reason
and<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:49.540> not<00:02:49.720> sure<00:02:49.870> with<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.230> stormtroopers

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and I'm not sure with the stormtroopers

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.330 
and I'm not sure with the stormtroopers
for<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.280> legs<00:02:51.520> are<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:51.850> close<00:02:52.720> together<00:02:53.340> looks

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
