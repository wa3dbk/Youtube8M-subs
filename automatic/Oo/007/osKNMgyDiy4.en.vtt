00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
we can make back here well you have the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.790 
we can make back here well you have the
eleven<00:04:42.280> point<00:04:43.150> adjustable<00:04:43.870> dampening<00:04:44.439> system

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
eleven point adjustable dampening system

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.950 
eleven point adjustable dampening system
which<00:04:44.949> controls<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.669> rebound<00:04:45.819> on<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.479> shock

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
which controls the rebound on the shock

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.200 
which controls the rebound on the shock
okay<00:04:47.500> which<00:04:47.680> gives<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.159> ride<00:04:48.340> softer<00:04:49.180> or

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
instead of a softer ride you can adjust

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.719 
instead of a softer ride you can adjust
it<00:04:53.289> once<00:04:53.590> it's<00:04:53.800> all<00:04:53.949> installed<00:04:54.370> on<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.550> bike
