fun you see results rather quickly and
we<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.270> love<00:00:48.719> walking<00:00:48.930> around<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we all just love walking around with a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
we all just love walking around with a
pump<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> few<00:00:50.700> hours<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:52.170> let's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pump for a few hours right so let's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.639 
pump for a few hours right so let's
start<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.460> barbell<00:00:53.940> curl<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> you're

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
start with a barbell curl so you're

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.689 
start with a barbell curl so you're
going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.070> four<00:00:56.670> sets<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.680> 21s<00:00:58.699> basically

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going to do four sets of 21s basically

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.380 
going to do four sets of 21s basically
okay<00:01:00.000> now<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.969> kind<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> like

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
okay now it you can do like kind of like

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.890 
okay now it you can do like kind of like
a<00:01:03.449> traditional<00:01:04.049> 21<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.090> 777<00:01:06.090> type

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
a traditional 21 you know the 777 type

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.800 
a traditional 21 you know the 777 type
of<00:01:07.049> curl<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.860> could<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.490> high<00:01:08.939> rep<00:01:09.330> work

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
of curl you could just do high rep work

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.460 
of curl you could just do high rep work
up<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.890> 21<00:01:11.369> reps<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.320> your

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
up to 21 reps right so that's your

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.940 
up to 21 reps right so that's your
biceps<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.610> move<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.869> antagonist<00:01:16.530> muscle

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
biceps then move to an antagonist muscle

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
biceps then move to an antagonist muscle
now<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> me<00:01:18.030> kind<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> manipulating<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
now this is me kind of manipulating the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
now this is me kind of manipulating the
concept<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> could<00:01:21.900> do

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
concept a little bit you could do

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950 
concept a little bit you could do
another<00:01:22.320> bicep<00:01:22.920> movement<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> wanted<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
another bicep movement if you wanted but

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.569 
another bicep movement if you wanted but
for<00:01:25.200> me<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.420> fully<00:01:27.600> develop<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> arm

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
for me to really fully develop the arm

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.550 
for me to really fully develop the arm
you<00:01:29.579> want<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.210> balance<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.409> you're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you want as much balance and if you're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
you want as much balance and if you're
going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> give<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.009> biceps<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> lot<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
going to give your biceps a lot of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
going to give your biceps a lot of
attention<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.420> got<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> give<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> triceps<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
attention you got to give the triceps a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
attention you got to give the triceps a
lot<00:01:34.619> since<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.790> more<00:01:35.970> muscle<00:01:36.210> there

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
lot since you have more muscle there

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100 
lot since you have more muscle there
anyway<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:39.180> take<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.689> other<00:01:39.840> two

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
anyway right so you take the other two

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.429 
anyway right so you take the other two
numbers<00:01:40.500> 16<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.640> 4<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.780> different

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
numbers 16 and 4 now a different

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.480 
numbers 16 and 4 now a different
approach<00:01:43.820> 16<00:01:44.820> sets<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.479> 4<00:01:45.780> reps<00:01:46.079> ok<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.130> that's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
approach 16 sets of 4 reps ok so that's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.810 
approach 16 sets of 4 reps ok so that's
how<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> work<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> first<00:01:49.649> half<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
how you work it so on the first half you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590 
how you work it so on the first half you
got<00:01:50.970> four<00:01:51.450> sets<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.200> 21<00:01:52.770> reps<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.090> second

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
got four sets of 21 reps on the second

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.620 
got four sets of 21 reps on the second
half<00:01:55.070> 16<00:01:56.070> sets<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.759> 4<00:01:57.149> reps

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
half 16 sets of 4 reps

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.020 
half 16 sets of 4 reps
now<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.469> decide<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.250> movements<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.909> to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
now you decide the movements you want to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.300 
now you decide the movements you want to
do<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> muscles<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.869> want<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> target<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.770> love

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
do the muscles you want to target I love

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120 
do the muscles you want to target I love
doing<00:02:02.670> antagonist<00:02:03.329> training<00:02:03.750> meaning<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
doing antagonist training meaning for a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.609 
doing antagonist training meaning for a
push<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> pull<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> curl<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.469> an

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
push you do a pull for a curl you do an

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.010 
push you do a pull for a curl you do an
arm<00:02:07.799> extension<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.149> doing<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> squat

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
arm extension if you're doing a squat

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.930 
arm extension if you're doing a squat
then<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.979> something<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.580> works<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
then you do something that works the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.150 
then you do something that works the
posterior<00:02:12.390> chain

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
posterior chain

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.780 
posterior chain
right<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:14.630> use<00:02:15.020> these<00:02:15.440> numbers<00:02:15.860> use

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
right and just use these numbers use

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.370 
right and just use these numbers use
this<00:02:17.090> concept<00:02:17.900> as<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.400> different<00:02:19.400> approach<00:02:19.880> and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
this concept as a different approach and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.690 
this concept as a different approach and
I<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:21.410> you'll<00:02:21.770> like<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.070> results<00:02:22.100> it's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
I think you'll like the results it's
