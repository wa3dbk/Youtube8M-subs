00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
but yeah we do we have a very efficient

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
but yeah we do we have a very efficient
game<00:00:12.630> plan<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.200> think<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:13.950> stuck<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
game plan I think we stuck to it and I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.359 
game plan I think we stuck to it and I
think<00:00:14.839> you<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:15.960> as<00:00:16.230> players<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.770> really<00:00:17.160> want

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
think you know as players we really want

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.300 
think you know as players we really want
to<00:00:17.580> push<00:00:18.330> Russell<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> coaches<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.130> think

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to push Russell the coaches and I think

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.650

we<00:00:20.369> did<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.670> today<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> lot<00:00:21.630> easier

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
we did that today and it's a lot easier

another<00:01:23.250> game<00:01:23.520> I'd<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.780> way

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
another game I'd like to think that way

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.920 
another game I'd like to think that way
but<00:01:25.520> we<00:01:26.520> executed<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> game<00:01:27.390> plan<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.840> I'm

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
but we executed the game plan so I'm

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.740 
but we executed the game plan so I'm
proud<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> our<00:01:28.320> team<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.570> really

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
proud of our team for that but it really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
proud of our team for that but it really
hasn't<00:01:30.960> set<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.130> well

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
hasn't set in and I think it well

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.450 
hasn't set in and I think it well
sometimes<00:01:32.729> true<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.600> was<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> difference

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
sometimes true what was the difference

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.620 
sometimes true what was the difference
offensively<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.880> guys<00:01:36.030> executing

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
offensively for you guys executing

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
offensively for you guys executing
because<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> had<00:01:37.170> third<00:01:37.380> down<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> see

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
because when you had third down you see

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.620 
because when you had third down you see
you<00:01:38.100> could<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> needed

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you could get first down what you needed

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
you could get first down what you needed
them<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> keep<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> drug<00:01:40.710> home<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.100> do

for this for this game at this moment

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.289 
for this for this game at this moment
and<00:02:11.290> we<00:02:12.099> really<00:02:12.340> came<00:02:12.489> out<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:12.910> expected

though<00:02:16.480> maybe<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.140> house<00:02:18.129> was<00:02:18.310> awesome<00:02:18.459> I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
though maybe this house was awesome I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.520 
though maybe this house was awesome I
think<00:02:19.599> I've<00:02:19.690> missed<00:02:19.870> them<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.049> couple<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.380> times

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
think I've missed them a couple of times

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.229 
think I've missed them a couple of times
so<00:02:20.799> hopefully<00:02:21.280> it's<00:02:21.370> not<00:02:21.459> mad<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:21.790> me<00:02:21.819> about<00:02:21.970> it

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
so hopefully it's not mad at me about it

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.630 
so hopefully it's not mad at me about it
but<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.440> place<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.400> hard

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
but if you place you know really hard

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.390 
but if you place you know really hard
he's<00:02:24.790> from<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> fastest<00:02:25.390> customer<00:02:25.840> see

he's from the fastest customer see

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.470 
he's from the fastest customer see
sometimes<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.610> would<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.849> an<00:02:28.000> empty<00:02:28.180> it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
sometimes we would get an empty it's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.140 
sometimes we would get an empty it's
hard<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.690> see<00:02:28.870> him<00:02:29.099> he's<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:30.430> fast<00:02:30.700> he<00:02:30.819> gets<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
hard to see him he's so fast he gets a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.750 
hard to see him he's so fast he gets a
pump<00:02:32.019> or<00:02:32.200> was<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:32.500> four<00:02:32.709> thumbs<00:02:32.950> up<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.640> the
