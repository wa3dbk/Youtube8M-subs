00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and of course the this means that

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.130 
and of course the this means that
whatever<00:02:20.260> available<00:02:20.980> time<00:02:21.250> left<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.720> attack

the minions are able to actually destroy

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.140 
the minions are able to actually destroy
the<00:02:25.659> whole<00:02:25.780> base<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.290> will<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.370> recommend<00:02:27.730> this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the whole base I will not recommend this

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.809 
the whole base I will not recommend this
strategy<00:02:28.720> unless<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> maxout<00:02:30.370> level

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
strategy unless you have a maxout level

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.259 
strategy unless you have a maxout level
6<00:02:31.180> balloon<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:31.989> makes<00:02:32.650> out<00:02:32.799> level<00:02:33.489> 6<00:02:33.760> minutes

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
6 balloon and makes out level 6 minutes

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.509 
6 balloon and makes out level 6 minutes
and<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.140> barbarian<00:02:35.650> King<00:02:35.829> actually<00:02:36.310> just

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
and now the barbarian King actually just

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.270 
and now the barbarian King actually just
came<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.239> actually<00:02:37.540> another<00:02:38.290> mass<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:39.220> one

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
came out to actually another mass at one

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.970 
came out to actually another mass at one
big<00:02:39.970> giant<00:02:40.209> bomb<00:02:40.510> boom<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.650> does<00:02:41.799> I've

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
big giant bomb boom and it does I've

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.300 
big giant bomb boom and it does I've
affect<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.609> level<00:02:42.760> 7<00:02:43.209> barbarian<00:02:43.599> king<00:02:43.810> at<00:02:43.959> all

affect the level 7 barbarian king at all

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.420 
affect the level 7 barbarian king at all
with<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:46.030> strategy<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.989> very<00:02:47.709> costly<00:02:48.040> in

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
with this strategy is very costly in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.030 
with this strategy is very costly in
terms<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.909> the<00:02:49.480> elixir<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.139> would<00:02:50.889> not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
terms of the elixir I would not

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.220 
terms of the elixir I would not
recommend<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:51.609> if<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.180> are<00:02:52.450> having<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.079> low

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
recommend you if you are having a low

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.860 
recommend you if you are having a low
level<00:02:53.440> balloon<00:02:54.099> or<00:02:54.340> low-level<00:02:54.879> minions<00:02:55.629> you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
level balloon or low-level minions you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.899 
level balloon or low-level minions you
need<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.170> have<00:02:56.319> high<00:02:56.680> level<00:02:57.069> balloon<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.790> high

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
need to have high level balloon and high

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.990 
need to have high level balloon and high
level<00:02:58.239> minions<00:02:59.139> in<00:02:59.319> order<00:02:59.769> to<00:03:00.099> utilize<00:03:00.430> this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
level minions in order to utilize this

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.539 
level minions in order to utilize this
strategy<00:03:01.599> right<00:03:02.379> so<00:03:02.650> basically<00:03:02.980> that's<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
strategy right so basically that's it

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.000 
strategy right so basically that's it
