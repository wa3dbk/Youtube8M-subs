00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.460
 welcome to come back from university I am 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.550
 Chef Corichi and today we have 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.150
 the bread and not the bread and belongs to the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.360
 line of cayenne so we have this 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.189
 equipment that has two plates 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.650
 completely made of iron 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.040
 cast the cast iron has this 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.579
 color and it is quite heavy which we 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.360
 will help to be able to mark and cook 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.060
 even cook breasts lots of 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.790
 networks but the main objective is 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.910
 iron our sandwiches our 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.240
 bread and we call him in his country that 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.660
 it makes us different in good times in 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.270
 bag we have degrees the grades that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.940
 we can measure here at the temperature that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.280
 we want to cook that's why 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.800
 we have degrees the competition only has 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.700
 numbers and what do we want the degrees for 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.810
 I repeat again if it is a sandwich 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.509
 will have a lower temperature 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 but if it's a piece of breast one 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.289
 highest temperature and now we're going to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.659
 make the sandwich or the bread and do not 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.750
 simply bread we recommend a bread that 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.740
 sugar is high in sugar 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.030
 will it be that caramel or that the striped 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.540
 be a little faster so 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.820
 we just put mayonnaise 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.320
 in the bread 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 we put mustard or they can do it 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 what you want, I will add 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.790
 here some slices 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.810
 of ham 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.840
 some sausage 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.310
 salami chorizo what you have to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 hand 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.840
 some slices of cheese 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.260
 and what I recommend there are two ways to 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.960
 can iron the bread and with the lettuce or 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.420
 without the lettuce as you want to 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.960
 some people do not like that the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.950
 Lettuce leaves withered 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.080
 in the ironing of the healthy 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.410
 we already have it but before that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.080
 I recommend a little spray we will use 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.870
 a little sprite of either oil 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.610
 olive or butter of what you 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.740
 have at hand 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.740
 and they will place it in the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.790
 very important in our team 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.579
 this iron when it lowers 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.609
 this has a movement so this 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.189
 movement is very important at the time 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.010
 to go down so I recommend them 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:11.290
 concentrate it in the center so that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.349
 pressure be even 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.530
 ok now let's check if you are already 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:22.870
 ready our bread and our sandwiches 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.269
 raise the lid look at the striped 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.269
 so the bread and it's not working 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.280
 and is ready to serve now the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.160
 cleaning is very important every time 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.430
 are using this equipment I recommend 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.220
 always with the brush that comes in the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.000
 team brush a little bit whatever 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.940
 stuck so this does not interfere with 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.360
 the taste of the next sandwich or 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.640
 next product everything falls into this 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.040
 tray so this can be used and 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 then remove to clean it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.069
 remember the mass I made with the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.099
 blender, well, here it is ready 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.040
 that for Italians we have a good 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.410
 solution for those who want to do flat 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.980
 breads 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.990
 grilled bread we can cut a 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.560
 piece of dough 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.820
 simply dough with leavening 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.820
 or with yeast 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.780
 and I already have here one that is 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.590
 working 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.590
 so 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.000
 it is cooked 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.040
 I'm making bread on bread and this is 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.930
 very important for the Italians in their 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.200
 restaurants so the only thing that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.490
 we have to do is place the dough 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.249
 place the and 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.059
 and close and the result will be this 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:03.749
 and now the difference between a panini and 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:07.289
 a moving plate maybe this equipment does not 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:10.259
 know him this we just used it this 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.689
 you know how it works this is the iron 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.029
 mobile because the mobile because we can 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.879
 move anywhere is a team very 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:21.479
 versatile has two plates as they already 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:24.479
 I said it 's aluminum, so aluminum 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.119
 heats faster than cast steel 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:31.289
 more versatile because we can make eggs 

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:34.919
 bacon ham breasts what you guys 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.110
 want it does not need to be closed for 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.149
 start cooking once you 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.749
 place the product this is already 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:46.110
 hot so this helps both 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:48.979
 sides are cooked at the same time something 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.979
 as well as a broker 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.930
 this movement we can 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.310
 control with this screw 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.310
 I can tighten it 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.870
 and go down to this point I'm going to 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.680
 teach with bread 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.680
 this is bread 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:18.590
 I crush to a certain point 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.050
 but if I want more space between the two 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.050
 plates I can do this
