00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 It was not wrong, I'm bringing one more. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 macro there you are and the makro of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.740
 high disconnect basically works 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.250
 so when or if you have a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 certain life is not 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 it will go back to the initial menu then 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:51.620
 huh 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:54.539
 let's put it here easy controls 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.690
 if the contract has internet access 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:05.540
 it 's not about collecting you do not have a good 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:09.409
 connection 488 show now that bad 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.409
 throw away 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.860
 I'll pick you up later 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.280
 I picked up the mark and it will die. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.280
 see 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.590
 before dying what with two hearts 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.369
 bad but before you die your understand 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.200
 huh 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:39.270
 Before he dies he'll disconnect you. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.430
 Are you going back there first, bye? 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.470
 bye ahead of the disconnected region and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 will go in grade 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:06.159
 the makro attached to the front is just there 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:08.560
 appears with four hearts with 42 still 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:24.310
 The description I'm putting to you 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:34.870
 you here with 888 your life goes until 2011 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 as well as the item 10 hearts each medium 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.280
 Heart Works as a Life and 8a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:56.829
 would be the number 808 is half of each 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:03:01.150
 heart then would be four 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.049
 hearts and will give the disconnect then it is 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.100
 That's it folks 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:10.840
 If you liked the code okay you 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.549

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.410
 brings videos links of two videos and this 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.410
 It's really the capital 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:35.819
 presses can be made the year made 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.400
 through the lawyer now I called the 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.359
 defender thinks she's going to get the time 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:48.230
 right 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:53.090
