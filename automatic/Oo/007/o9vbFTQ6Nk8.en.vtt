00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.559
 welcome sometimes tip to nearby 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 kitchen today we will talk about sprouts of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.170
 soy sauteed a recipe based 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.570
 very consumed vegetables in the homes of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.939
 Chinese indeed less teach one 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 Chinese girl friend who loved me rate 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.720
 some tricks showed me them 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.250
 at home as I prepare it but in reality it is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 very simple and very fast too 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
 very appetizing 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.120
 he has difficulties that can be encountered 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 and to find the bean sprouts that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 in its Italian markets they are small and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.840
 cost a lot of difference instead of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
 these envelopes I buy in the neighborhood 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 Chinese in the cities that are in Rome by 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.989
 the vittorio boy that they cost 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.379
 only one euro they have 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.660
 size you see much more important 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.180
 compared to those I repeat that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 we find little bags in the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 supermarket 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.699
 this is the only difficulty apart 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.890
 those for and resolved sauces that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.729
 therefore we use in Chinese cuisine 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.060
 rice wine rice vinegar and so 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.560
 Street 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 however the rest we say is very simple 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.729
 so we can start at this point 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.080
 to see the ingredients to prepare 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.080
 our agenda 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.780
 of carrots maybe stick 30 grams 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.820
 of spring onion theme of this stick 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 Abundant spoon of rice wine 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.240
 that is to say a generous spoon 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.300
 of rice vinegar but this one is of use 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.360
 this then a spoonful of cornstarch photo 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.550
 of organic water just for frying 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 that salt would be nothing else we can 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.770

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.790
 ok we are ready places and a lot of camp is 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.710
 smoking is not an important thing i 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.550
 Soybeans with I have to be cooked 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.990
 first but they must be put in the pan 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.450
 directly fresh so we can 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:26.740
