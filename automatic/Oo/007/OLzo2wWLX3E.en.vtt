00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.629
 I present to your attention the strobe 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.190
 running lights will be useful to motorists 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.280
 and also a motorcycle racer who want themselves 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.250
 highlight on the road 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.760
 respectively, four lenses we have here 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760
 so they look 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.800
 shines very brightly at the thought under direct 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.809
 by way of being so here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 blinding eyes then the whole thing departs 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.570
 we have such control here and we 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.079
 Respectively now 12 volts 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.100
 connected all show what modes are 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.090
 By the way, the bottom of the console is controlled here. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:58.460
 accordingly we press it with us 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.859
 turned off again once turned on 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.789
 the next mode actually works like 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 strobe lights 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.960
 and these are all modes as if in one 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 that is, it blinks and moves smoothly 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 further click again but this is in general 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.250
 such a regime is about to post it in braces 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 we press further 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:34.409
 how the garlands start back there yet 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.259
 times less less so slow 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.710
 the tempo of moving still click well here 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.159
 there are such alternate 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.159
 very fast 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:54.240
 all blink together that is, I think you are 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.390
 camera can watch what shines 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 they are very rarely appropriate here 7 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.450
 modes here and control from the console that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.640
 very conveniently possible that is up to 30 meters 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.400
 he takes one hundred percent can be included 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 you can turn off the light on a constant 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.660
 we have everything included as with 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.230
 foglights thank you all for 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.230
 Attention
