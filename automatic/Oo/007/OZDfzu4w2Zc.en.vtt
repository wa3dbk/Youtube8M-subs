ever<00:00:10.019> wondered<00:00:10.469> why<00:00:10.679> some<00:00:10.740> people<00:00:11.550> can<00:00:11.759> draw

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
ever wondered why some people can draw

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.910 
ever wondered why some people can draw
well<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.570> other<00:00:12.870> people<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.530> seem<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
well and other people just seem to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.490 
well and other people just seem to
struggle<00:00:14.480> do<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.570> ever<00:00:15.660> really<00:00:15.929> want<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> know

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
struggle do you ever really want to know

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.560 
struggle do you ever really want to know
what's<00:00:16.740> really<00:00:17.160> happening<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> minds<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
what's really happening in the minds of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
what's really happening in the minds of
artists<00:00:19.080> well<00:00:19.949> you've<00:00:20.070> probably<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.520> heard

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
artists well you've probably all heard

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.189 
artists well you've probably all heard
that<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.090> has<00:00:21.210> something<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.080> way

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
that it has something to do with the way

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.650 
that it has something to do with the way
we<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.619> things<00:00:23.000> but<00:00:24.000> that's<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> whole

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
we see things but that's not the whole

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.370 
we see things but that's not the whole
story

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
story

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.980 
story
you<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.340> our<00:00:26.519> eyes<00:00:26.730> bring<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.300> information

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you see our eyes bring in information

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.589 
you see our eyes bring in information
but<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.800> happens<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> brain<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
but it's what happens in the brain that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.290 
but it's what happens in the brain that
really<00:00:31.050> matters<00:00:31.500> our<00:00:32.160> eyes<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:33.030> see

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
really matters our eyes really don't see

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900 
really matters our eyes really don't see
anything<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.710> our<00:00:34.920> brains<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.610> do

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
anything at all it's our brains that do

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.869 
anything at all it's our brains that do
all<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.149> heavy<00:00:36.420> lifting<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:37.340> fact<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
all the heavy lifting in fact if you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
all the heavy lifting in fact if you
close<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.390> eyes<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> minute<00:00:40.140> you'll

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
close your eyes for a minute you'll

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.010 
close your eyes for a minute you'll
probably<00:00:40.829> feel<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> restful<00:00:41.940> feeling<00:00:42.420> that's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
probably feel a restful feeling that's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
probably feel a restful feeling that's
not<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.829> eyes<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.070> resting<00:00:44.820> it's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
not because your eyes are resting it's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
not because your eyes are resting it's
because<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.899> brain<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.320> resting<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.100> all

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because your brain is resting from all

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
because your brain is resting from all
the<00:00:47.460> information<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.450> your<00:00:48.570> eyes<00:00:48.719> are

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the information that your eyes are

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.920 
the information that your eyes are
bringing<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.789> when<00:00:50.969> most<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.420> us<00:00:51.570> look

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
bringing in you see when most of us look

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
bringing in you see when most of us look
at<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> tree<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:53.100> information<00:00:53.820> goes<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> our

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
at a tree that information goes to our

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.110 
at a tree that information goes to our
brain<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.710> something<00:00:56.340> happens<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.969> our

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
brain and then something happens in our

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
brain and then something happens in our
brains<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.440> produce<00:00:58.800> something<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> looks

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
brains to produce something that looks

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.049 
brains to produce something that looks
like<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> tree

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
like this this is not how we see a tree

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.320 
like this this is not how we see a tree
actually<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.640> fix

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
actually so what we need to do is fix

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.960 
actually so what we need to do is fix
our<00:01:06.630> brains<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> train<00:01:08.400> our<00:01:08.640> brains

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
our brains we need to train our brains

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.350 
our brains we need to train our brains
to<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:12.090> process

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to see the way we actually process

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
to see the way we actually process
information<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.500> eyes<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.880> we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
information in our eyes so that when we

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
information in our eyes so that when we
see<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> tree<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.900> draw<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> tree<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.310> get

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
see a tree and draw a tree we get

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.999 
see a tree and draw a tree we get
something<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> looks<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
something that looks like this

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.210 
something that looks like this
not<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.500> need<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.950> able<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
not like that so we need to be able to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.399 
not like that so we need to be able to
process<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.180> abstract<00:01:24.960> textures<00:01:25.799> Lon's

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
process the abstract textures Lon's

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
process the abstract textures Lon's
forms<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> values<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.579> actually<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.509> on

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
forms and values that we actually see on

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
forms and values that we actually see on
objects<00:01:31.250> take<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> look<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> drawing<00:01:33.000> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
objects take a look at this drawing of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.330 
objects take a look at this drawing of
the<00:01:33.299> tree<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.659> close<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the tree up close do you see all the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.120 
the tree up close do you see all the
abstract<00:01:35.939> textures<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.869> values<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.799> shapes

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
abstract textures and values and shapes

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490 
abstract textures and values and shapes
that<00:01:38.430> happen<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.840> way<00:01:40.110> our<00:01:40.290> eyes

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that happen this is the way our eyes

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
that happen this is the way our eyes
actually<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.759> things<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.229> order<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
actually see things so in order to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.170 
actually see things so in order to
understand<00:01:44.189> where<00:01:44.369> our<00:01:44.460> eyes<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.610> actually

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
understand where our eyes are actually

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.620 
understand where our eyes are actually
seen<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.140> look<00:01:46.619> at<00:01:46.829> objects<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.640> fact

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
seen we have to look at objects in fact

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
seen we have to look at objects in fact
we<00:01:48.930> need<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.259> look<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.680> objects<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.340> least<00:01:50.670> half

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
we need to look at objects at least half

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.980 
we need to look at objects at least half
the<00:01:51.030> time<00:01:51.509> drawing<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.890> least<00:01:53.250> 50%

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
the time drawing is at least 50%

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
the time drawing is at least 50%
observation<00:01:54.990> drawing<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
observation drawing is actually a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.530 
observation drawing is actually a
process<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.920> transferring<00:01:58.920> information

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540

information<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.899> comes<00:02:01.259> into<00:02:01.469> our<00:02:01.590> eyes

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
information that comes into our eyes

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.179 
information that comes into our eyes
then<00:02:02.610> goes<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> our<00:02:03.270> brains<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.500> goes<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.829> our

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
then goes to our brains then goes to our

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.910 
then goes to our brains then goes to our
hands<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.810> manifests<00:02:06.810> itself<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> paper

in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> form<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.879> drawing<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> think

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
in the form of a drawing I like to think

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
in the form of a drawing I like to think
of<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> drawing<00:02:11.879> cycle

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of this is a drawing cycle

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.420 
of this is a drawing cycle
and<00:02:13.379> drawing<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.489> skill<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:16.590> skill<00:02:17.099> can

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and drawing is a skill and a skill can

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.559 
and drawing is a skill and a skill can
be<00:02:17.459> learned<00:02:18.170> by<00:02:19.170> anyone<00:02:19.890> yes<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:20.879> includes

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
be learned by anyone yes this includes

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.740 
be learned by anyone yes this includes
you<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:23.040> how<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.819> better<00:02:24.090> at<00:02:24.420> drawing

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you so how do we get better at drawing

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.429 
you so how do we get better at drawing
when<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.379> understand<00:02:26.189> this<00:02:26.430> drawing<00:02:26.790> cycle

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
when we understand this drawing cycle

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.710 
when we understand this drawing cycle
well<00:02:28.439> it's<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.219> about<00:02:29.250> practice<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.239> more

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
well it's all about practice and more

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.809 
well it's all about practice and more
practice<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.530> more<00:02:31.890> practice<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.700> more

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
practice and more practice and more

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.179 
practice and more practice and more
practice<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.989> more<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.409> practice<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
practice the more you practice the

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.580 
practice the more you practice the
better<00:02:35.489> you'll<00:02:35.849> get<00:02:36.060> at<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.510> skill<00:02:36.989> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
better you'll get at this skill this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.860 
better you'll get at this skill this
drawing<00:02:38.069> cycle<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.000> happens<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.569> your<00:02:39.689> brain

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
drawing cycle that happens in your brain

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.530 
drawing cycle that happens in your brain
the<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:40.889> you<00:02:41.069> draw<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.400> more<00:02:42.239> you'll<00:02:42.389> be

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the more you draw the more you'll be

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.199 
the more you draw the more you'll be
able<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.840> train<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.349> brain<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.829> see<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:45.060> what

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
able to train your brain to see so what

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.009 
able to train your brain to see so what
are<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.329> waiting<00:02:45.599> for
