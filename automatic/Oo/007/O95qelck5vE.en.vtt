 domestic resorts this year 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.440

 and this despite the fact that the season has just begun 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 many officials 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.840
 traffic police representatives this year 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.699
 came from choosing our direction 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.670
 Russian resorts you did not watch 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.369
 Sochi regions 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:10.590
 Adler Crimea is very much in principle 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.540
 offers of tour operators on these 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.810
 directions that year there were no such 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.390
 good prices there was no such choice 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.689
 daily departures from Moscow for all 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259

 this on the floor all major tour operators 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.890
 shifted to the sale of vouchers 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.990
 on the Russian resorts the blessing Crimean

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 airport terminals 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.070
 and the city of Sochi pulled the service up 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.500
 European level 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.210
 one of the main reasons why declining 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.520
 demand for foreign resorts 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.740
 This is not only and not so much restrictions 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 on such travel for security officials 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.970
 or such a trend as patriotic 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.250
 tourism has spread among 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 officials first is 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.630
 price hike of euro and dollar tour operators 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 soon predicts and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.399
 further decline in tourist traffic to Europe 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.219
 Schengen planned in April yet 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.680
 extended until September to introduce mandatory 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.780

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.729

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.260
 it was moved to september and planned 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.290
 introduce visas for travel 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 eurozone countries are already enough 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.470
 tough for example to get her and

 permits do not need to go on vacation 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.930
 outside the country it is worth checking whether 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.730

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.010

 more than 700 96 million rubles in
