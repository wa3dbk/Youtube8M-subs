00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
so hopefully that spoon of some help to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.020 
so hopefully that spoon of some help to
you

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.710 
you
just<00:03:54.540> one<00:03:54.750> last<00:03:54.990> thing<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:56.130> with<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.490> caps<00:03:56.730> we

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
just one last thing is with the caps we

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.060 
just one last thing is with the caps we
always<00:03:57.990> recommend<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.530> when<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.830> get<00:03:58.950> in

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
always recommend that when you get in

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.320 
always recommend that when you get in
your<00:03:59.190> radio<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.670> know<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.090> get<00:04:00.240> a<00:04:00.270> new

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
your radio you know you get a new

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.660 
your radio you know you get a new
radiator<00:04:00.720> cap<00:04:01.110> as<00:04:01.260> well<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:02.580> that's

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
radiator cap as well and that's

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.970 
radiator cap as well and that's
basically<00:04:03.210> because<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.260> existing<00:04:04.650> cap<00:04:04.830> that

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
basically because the existing cap that

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.980 
basically because the existing cap that
you<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.280> might<00:04:05.640> not<00:04:05.850> be<00:04:06.000> an<00:04:06.120> exact<00:04:06.540> fit<00:04:06.780> for

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
you have might not be an exact fit for

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.650 
you have might not be an exact fit for
the<00:04:07.050> new<00:04:07.170> radiator<00:04:07.550> it<00:04:08.550> also<00:04:08.700> could<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.150> rust

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the new radiator it also could have rust

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.300 
the new radiator it also could have rust
or<00:04:09.900> corrosion<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.650> things<00:04:10.830> like<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.070> which

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
or corrosion and things like that which

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.280 
or corrosion and things like that which
are<00:04:11.460> stopping<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.270> from<00:04:12.300> working<00:04:12.720> properly<00:04:12.870> so

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
are stopping it from working properly so

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.260 
are stopping it from working properly so
that<00:04:13.830> that's<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.460> reasons<00:04:14.790> why<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.120> always

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
that that's the reasons why we always

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.970 
that that's the reasons why we always
recommend<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.990> get<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.170> new<00:04:16.320> cap<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.860> go

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
recommend that you get a new cap to go

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.930 
recommend that you get a new cap to go
with<00:04:17.100> your<00:04:17.190> new<00:04:17.250> radiator

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
with your new radiator

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.300 
with your new radiator
that<00:04:18.450> way<00:04:18.570> we<00:04:18.750> can<00:04:18.840> guarantee<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.709> will<00:04:19.890> be<00:04:20.160> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
that way we can guarantee it will be a

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.150 
that way we can guarantee it will be a
perfect<00:04:20.670> fit<00:04:21.440> I'm<00:04:22.440> not<00:04:22.620> going<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.890> have<00:04:22.980> any

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
perfect fit I'm not going to have any

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.880 
perfect fit I'm not going to have any
buddies<00:04:23.400> without<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:23.940> all<00:04:24.380> folks<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.800> is
