00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hmm 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.130
 car 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.130
 Hmm 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:18.340
 Yes, I 'm Takeshita, let's see today. 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.480
 Do I know foreigner's a ne well Hey sells outside youtube is it with that camera 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.070
 like this 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.940
 Well I when to introduce the Toka lens well, are not you taking what the de something ah 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.400
 A little dreaming about the atmosphere 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:36.240
 This time it's a bit like enzymes and it's a- I'd like to introduce it from now on 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.450
 Well again I bought a new lens 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.540
 This time the cutter lens is this 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.640
 Tamron 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:50.120
 16 mm 300 mm f 3 points luxury 6 points 3 di 2 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.940
 It will be a lens called vc pzd macro 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.440
 Sunlight gradually 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.980
 I've Te' 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.950
 That already hasn't been opened yet 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.600
 We use this to already actually netsuke 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.000
 It is this lens 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.080
 This is what is called a high-magnification zoom lens. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.650
 Even though in that categorical you know the standard of the zoom lens 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.750
 16 mm to 300 mm 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:23.800
 It is referred to as a go in this one from the wide-angle to 300mm telephoto to 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 It becomes a lens What I am wearing now is 70 d 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.190
 Do you see 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.850
 When attached to the deco state 70 d, the focal length is 16 on the right in 35 mm conversion 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.640
 14.8 mm 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.390
 300 mm from 465 mm palm bottom prefecture 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.780
 Well it's great at it and I Nano to 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.040
 Now season Hano lens 24mm they have 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:56.110
 Or there is also a standard zoom lens 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:59.630
 As the price did not have 24.8m and also a 300 mm telephoto lens 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.900
 I didn't have one, so I really like school 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.920
 I was close 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.920
 In this lens itself in 2014 cp + 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.290
 It is a new race sputum of that issued the Tamron 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.220
 In the last before this last model is 18 mm 270 mm 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.370
 There was a model whose model number is b 008 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.890
 It will be a pre- good economy of that model color 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.480
 Model number 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.790
 I think I'm likely to become the word cartoon b 016 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.790
 Well detailed one is the lens diameter is filter diameter 67mm 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.959
 540g in weight 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.569
 Simple drip-proof structure in consideration of public house photography 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.500
 It is a new material full of sense of quality that adopted the tungsten silver brad ring 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.680
 I will 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:53.560
 The shortest shooting distance is 39 cm 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.560
 I guess is around about 0.3 times maximum magnification is 1.29 times 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.489
 There is a notation here vc 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 This is the meaning of image stabilization and drive ps on it 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:12.400
 This seems to be an ultrasonic motor, so-called silent drive 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.400
 I think this is not a ne Well vocal about it though is doing in the wind that 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.520
 Well, let's take an appropriate shot of that end 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.800
 This lens is 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:56.730
 It seems that the mark Marklo is written at the end, and the maximum shooting magnification is 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.710
 You can see 0.3 times 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:06.570
 It's so big it can be transferred 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.570
 I'd like to take the appropriate a little this I have pine cones to yesterday 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.720
 It has a little taken by significantly to the sign of the character was s morning 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.160
 Et al. Now Now Now I tried to take a close-up photograph on the doorstep of flowers 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:46.009
 No, this lens is from 16 mm to 300 mm 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:51.580
 Or is not it can be used all in this one because 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:55.300
 I think you will eat only this one for example in family travel that 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:59.710
 Let 's talk about a children's sports event 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.350
 If you take a JNR train, the rest is aerial photography, right? 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.470
 It is like taking a plane 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.100
 After that, if you swear that you want to move animals, such animals that you will soon escape 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.970
 maybe 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.680
 You aim from Koto If you listen telephoto say this 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.409
 It is also in this sense 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.619
 That's fine, isn't it? 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.689
 The sauce Rutte that if we have only this one 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:26.569
 Don't bother 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:30.860
 You don't have to change lenses, but I think I like it. 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:34.129
 This Tamron's lens in that Internet article 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.230
 Or lens to be told the high-magnification zoom lens 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.310
 Say lack of depiction Is not it has been said in the wind 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.900
 That I'd Acha what De 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.900
 So strictly, hey 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.600
 This I that the Tteyuu the merchant 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:55.120
 For example, an amateur person 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.380
 I think that I do not know even if I wonder which one is still different lens with this lens 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.600
 Right? 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:06.870
 Well from the amateur level you are a good deal 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:11.370
 It is also the skill in the art but Well I tried in I also took this in nothing sheet 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:15.690
 It was a real'm good good I and that Well strictly speaking 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.690
 For example, it is a large poster size Toka such size 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.249
 I think that if you try to extend it there will be a new arrival 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.579
 I well 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:27.770
 That demoted 16mm 4 is this 

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:31.069
 Even in the wind that there are a few places that curve towards the four corners 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.440
 Though there was also a sound review of the video or something 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.720
 Well not so much 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.900
 Urata no 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.340
 It wasn't what I was aiming for so much 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:48.180
 Well I though it was my Well intuitive Well impressions 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.180
 It is enough for the general one to use as an amateur level 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:58.810
 Park thinks like a good chain 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:05.610
 Then , in the park near by 70 d according to the day when this lens arrived last 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.610
 I would like to do last while seeing the photos I took so
