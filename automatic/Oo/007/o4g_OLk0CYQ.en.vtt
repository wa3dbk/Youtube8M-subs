00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.210
 very good to all how are you 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.640
 welcome to the channel I am the lic 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.980
 effectively welcome to the division 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.220
 to my perception to my personal opinion 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.710
 about what it has been or is being 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.470
 something since a few hours of beta 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.730
 for at and for the night and fall 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.739
 as many say first first let's go 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.060
 to comment on a very important thing and 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.099
 is that I'm playing with the smart 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 Fissile the gun that under my point 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.300
 view is a chet you do not want to make a 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.430
 gameplay about it but I'm going to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.490
 save simply because you listen to me and 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.790
 you see it because I really believe that 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.830
 It's pretty good 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.310
 it would really be almost the only thing to me 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.020
 I would not play time 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.660
 the beta of what we have seen is what 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.010
 least I like it maybe it's a little bit in the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.589
 home 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.059
 in the absence of need to point at anyone 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.730
 you have to be a tad close to being a 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.140
 tast ready when it comes to move and little 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.920
 more has a range that as you can 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.170
 check is a range that is pretty 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.750
 great is to say I believe that this range 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.939
 possible if we lower it a tad or if 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.890
 we lowered the damage of three bullets a little 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.390
 we kill a pilot and we kill 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.640
 a green 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.930
 that has solved but good 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.370
 we really go a little bit so yes 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.229
 I really think that I like it even though I 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.659
 I liked it or that I have seen that it is 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.770
 well do not think that this is an opinion 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.940
 let's play what everyone you 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.820
 enter by the view at the beginning in 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 graphics theme and so we are a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.750
 generation that theoretically is the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.580
 next-gen for consoles and for good pc 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.250
 It seems that it is something that 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.990
 we have quotes for something normal not 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.090
 yes we may astound 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.909
 with something but everything is evolving 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.250
 a fairly logical way ncc the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.390
 jumps we santan as remarkable as 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.920
 in consoles the fact of the play 3 or xbox 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.860
 360 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.440
 4 a notoriety regarding the change 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.030
 graphic to jump graphic many people 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.410
 complaint says you the graphics are a 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.410
 fuck let's see is running with 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.940
 those minutes that has 10 years engine that 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.580
 has been used for many things not for 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 half life for portal for laughter 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.830
 so it's modified but still I 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.050
 I think it's so well squeezed 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.940
 has used that it's worth it or not 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.680
 it gives rise to say that the graphics are 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.970
 a shit in fact yourselves 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.070
 You can check the amount of things 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.620
 moving within the screen 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.010
 the whole game and the action there 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.570
 we are not we do not cover with the view not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.510
 we cover everything that happens is almost 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.580
 impossible or I believe that only that already 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.770
 the engine like another graphic with 10 years 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 with a few modifications endurance 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.430
 this for me from my point of view is 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.130
 de ole is bravo is not the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.220
 optimization for machines like a PC 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.380
 mid range that could be mine and this 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.080
 mid range if that media already supports one if 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.510
 high-end I think that the use is 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.190
 it is brutal is that when practically 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.540
 with everything to the maximum and recording at 60 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.579
 frames 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.099
 almost stable always so to speak 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.260
 with which we can not complain 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.599
 so much in that aspect then we can 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.609
 talk about the children's topic about these 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.329
 little people accompany us during each 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.310
 heading and that the guide controls them are 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.530
 a bit like us is a bit rajoy to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.019
 final cause a little silly them and 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.000
 I find it good that it could be a 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.769
 tast smarter but they give you a lot 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.840
 depth to the game of a depth 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.299
 of game that without them I know maybe 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.310
 Call of Duty would make a robot that is 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.920
 this the fact of having minions in the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.329
 need of the minions makes the 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.419
 game have a different depth and 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.560
 a dynamic that you think you do not 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.819
 for the still nowhere that is 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.819
 something that moves you have to shoot 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:46.659
 that maybe that's the resource that many 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.069
 Sometimes people have complained but they are 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.810
 equated waiting for him to come by 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.439
 here that passes through the pass does not fuck you 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.939
 but these children who are so 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.500
 eliminating because the fact of seeing 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.780
 four minimum equipment is tempting and that 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.760
 you have to load them in fact those 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.600
 same children make the likes or to 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.370
 the titans be faster is to say 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.810
 that you have and remove much faster 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.440
 every time that beloved domain is lowered the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.480
 time of appearance of the titan and that 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.920
 Well, it's the grace of the game of 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.960
 siat and neither is it one of the graces that 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.090
 also then there is the touch the touch 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.950
 inevitable from mirror's edge this the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.840
 world room the power to run the parkour 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.800
 jump wide runs through the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.220
 walls 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.980
 cool is a very cool shooter 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.320
 this guy does not talk about it being cool in 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.000
 a game because I have said is not 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.150
 in the sets within little even of good 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.900
 is already next to both of them and that's something 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.630
 that I fall in love with the fact that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.790
 the use of the same war room 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.520
 dt of a speed bus or that makes 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.730
 it is much faster and it deserves the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.980
 pity for that also in quotes I think 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.470
 that the sniper at the moment someone is and 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.150
 Perez the beta over there I think they are 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.100
 with sniper rifles I think 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.170
 under my point of view they are superfluous but not 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.090
 because they are still or stop being 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.080
 hedges but because after all it is 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.449
 something that I will not use 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.030
 because I do not find it necessary to me 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.289
 like the dynamics of running and jumping 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.670
 attack with a sniper you can not that you're 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.130
 a mega pro of the host and you're a 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.940
 and so fake ter trick chicken shooter 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.710
 I do not think I proceed in folk titan 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.450
 I think sniper vices do not 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.720
 they proceed or they do not stick with what is the 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.060
 philosophy of this game 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.410
 and innovate with the titans is not good 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.590
 same is not an innovation and introduce 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.810
 robots in a game but it's one more weapon 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.660
 after all, the titan is a weapon not 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.240
 is that the game go of robots 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.030
 exclusively but it's a weapon plus I 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.760
 I see that way is a different way 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.260
 to channel a fight and face 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.820
 another situation do not be as if they had 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.680
 three different fights in one 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.270
 game are the minions sticking between 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.830
 they are the pilots hitting 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.960
 interested the titans sticking between 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.430
 them and then there is a communion of all 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.500
 the world of gando assents the whole world 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.410
 what makes it fun to climb 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.080
 score is very good one million worth 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.300
 20 a soldier is worth 100 and a titan is worth 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.190
 200 more or less I do not know exactly no and 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.710
 that's also good for the time of 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.750
 get goals I think it's great 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.370
 attention to genius the truth is 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.320
 that from my point of view the game 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.969
 is very well is very balanced in 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.919
 Regarding combats in terms of 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.799
 a pilot the a titan of 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.209
 they raise a pilot versus pilot and so 

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:34.349
 resulting in a point that are stuck 

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:35.840
 the weapons so far what we could 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:38.240
 watch 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.650
 promises that I am very happy with what 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.090
 that could play in this beta we have 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.400
 in account the beta zone I always say 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.850
 forever 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.710
 let's think it's a beta no no 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.410
 let's analyze the final content that does not 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.120
 we still have now improvements graphically 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.550
 It is going to look better are not all 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.350
 optimized textures this is a test 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.120
 of stress for servers a test 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.500
 this is for books and it's something that the 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.150
 people forget when he takes a while 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.680
 played by people forget it so I 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.060
 I have been left with the desire to play more 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.580
 in quotes so to speak because 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.800
 an edition at level 14 can not upload 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.050
 fish obviously like all the 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.509
 you leave or you keep the aces in 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.740
 the sleeve and I hope it's that I do not think 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.740
 that the idea of a 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.170
 and respawn is exactly wait 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.520
 if it is done it is the manga and say that 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.530
 I would have spent 14 but it is not 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.550
 you've seen what's really good so 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.500
 nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.180
 the opinion my personal opinion is not a 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.640
 review , you know, you leave me the 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.200
 comments below a like is not too much 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.180
 and that we see the following video 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.180
 boys until then a bye peck
