00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.889
 the new generation of porsche cayman 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.370
 based on the new boxster of 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.920
 porsche 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.990
 we test the cayman s the medium 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.970
 engine variant stalks more and more 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.840
 from the shadow of the great brother of 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.880
 Porsche 911 with 239 kw he is out 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.300
 equipped and ready to turn every turn 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.300
 master 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.739
 also the most persistent fan of porsche 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.050
 911 will have to admit that now 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.780
 the middle engine design at boxster and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.390
 cayman quite your benefits has 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.750
 handling is much more agile and so on 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 You can get around the curves very fast and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.120
 also has the whole time 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.120
 really fun 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.290
 the shape of the cayman ensures 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 admiring looks he is wider 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.510
 dynamic and crouched body 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.119
 always acts as if ready to jump up to 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.040
 The cayman s slimmed down 30 kilograms 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.930
 the wheelbase is around six inches 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 which has grown more space in the interior 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.340
 but means especially in the border area 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.090
 a better control of the car for the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.090
 driver offers 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 b 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.159
 the sports exhaust with flaps technology 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.500
 are totally great feature works 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.929
 here in which I press this button 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.719
 then it gets louder, but above all 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.569
 in the interior you do not notice it outside 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.220
 so much because of course the legal 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.730
 regulations do not allow that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.590
 as a result you have to deal with his 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.240
 Neighbors do not entertain so well anymore 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.230
 So I do not know if you can do that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.180
 everything inside really needs everything 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.130
 sporty and comfortable 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.810
 the sports seats are the one and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.440
 get out of the train more difficult than 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.450
 facilitate 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.100
 The rising center console ensures 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.710
 short distances of the hand from the steering wheel to 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.840
 rocker and back the individual 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.050
 Control elements are clear 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.820
 disposed 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.670
 all keys and functions of the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.670
 Onboard computers are intuitively accessible 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.810
 from the tight space of the cayman have 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.820
 the stuttgarter with 4 125 liters 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.200
 stowage volume the best 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:40.090
 These then spread to 150 in front 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.090
 and back to 275 liters 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.530
 what really makes sense in my view 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.750
 after is the pdk 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.250
 because there is not only one gang 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.170
 more than with the handset namely 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.840
 seven instead of six, but still 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.550
 a sail function at the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.410
 glide on the highway to 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.910
 for example, the engine from the drive train 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 uncoupled and thus saves fuel 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.650
 It's good that's because of the manufacturer 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.390
 stated value of 8,0 liters per 100 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.520
 kilometer is also standard 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.360
 auto start stop not easy 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.850
 to reach 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.850
 with sport chrono package sprinting here in 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.340
 4 7 seconds from zero to 100 km h one 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.030
 time which is also some 900 yellow fan 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.030
 lets sit up 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.370
 I am quite pleased with the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.850
 equipment even if you have a lot of it 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.450
 actually does not need but this 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.450
 color here 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.140
 this this money i dont know what that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.379
 for a father and his son are 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.689
 I would somehow have to be personally 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.500
 von apparaten is of course also 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:56.870
 a matter of taste 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.299
 on all those whom the icon g9 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.590
 or too expensive is waiting with the cayman 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.230
 a real alternative 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.690
 the cayman s tested by us costs 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.819
 just like 69,000 euros in germany 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.659
 over 20,000 less than the base 911 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.610
 Of course, that's not all 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.669
 the question I need a cayman 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.759
 s or a normal one would be enough now 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.310
 ultimately, the ego has to decide 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:27.449
 the normal would probably come in the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.889
 most of them are probably his own 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.889
 ego can resist
