is a great commentator honestly I think

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.410 
is a great commentator honestly I think
he's<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.070> really<00:03:32.280> good<00:03:32.400> commentator<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.390> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
he's a really good commentator but I

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.990 
he's a really good commentator but I
think<00:03:33.720> he<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.050> he<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
think he just he just is in it for the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.330 
think he just he just is in it for the
money<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.600> think<00:03:36.840> he's<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.320> little<00:03:37.830> too<00:03:38.160> much

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
money and I think he's a little too much
