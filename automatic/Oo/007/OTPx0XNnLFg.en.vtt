00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.529
 Well, no 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.720
 hello everyone welcome to my channel once 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.580
 more today we are going to do a basic routine 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.469
 of face care for it I'm going to 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.139
 make use of the three steps of clinique 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.660
 that I think they essentially cover all 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.580
 routine and face care and can be 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.350
 a very easy way so freedom to 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
 all to get the face 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.030
 perfect and create a good foundation for 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.350
 our makeup this is the version of 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.450
 dry skin but there is also a 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.580
 version for oily skin with 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.860
 Different textures and products adapted 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.449
 to each skin let's start with the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.220
 first step that would be cleaning is 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.810
 It is essential to clean the face when 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.280
 we get up in the morning to 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.890
 eliminate all dead cells 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.420
 after the regeneration of the night and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.190
 at night to clean all the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.160
 impurities that we have accumulated during the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.680
 next day step would be to tone the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 water contact to our skin 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.250
 unbalances the ph and may take up to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.960
 48 hours to rebalance and the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.870
 application of a tonic does 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.760
 immediately and the last step would be the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.860
 hydration to maintain a skin 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.570
 juicy and hydrated throughout the day 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.210
 until the next time I touch you 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.249
 cleanse your face is remembered by the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 morning and evening and this is the 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.080
 skin version 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 dry there is also for oily skin 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.189
 as you see the joint clinic kit 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 everything you need to have a skin 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 perfect and now I will explain to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.470
 explain how to do it first thing 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.939
 we are going to do is going to withdraw the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.799
 face makeup if we were 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.320
 make up this would be for the night if 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.789
 outside the day would not be necessary and I'm going to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.670
 use with a make-up remover wipe and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.590
 directly I will move to remove all 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.289
 impudence or impurities or cells 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 dead with the gel I'm going to apply as 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.130
 half walnut in my hand 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 I'm going to emulsify first on the fingers and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.679
 then apply it on the face creating 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.149
 this little effect that the foam effect 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.130
 in this way we will remove all 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.380
 impurities that we will have that we have in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270
 the face and we leave the face prepared 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.220
 for the next step and we're going to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.200
 rinse with plenty of water to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.509
 Remove as much waste as you can 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.580
 have and as I have told you as we have 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.810
 rinse with water as our ph of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.060
 face has become unbalanced and 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.709
 we need to rebalance it for 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 that we are going to use the tonic this one also 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.000
 with the stories for dry skin we're going 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 to pick up a cotton disk we will wet the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 disc with tonic we will hold it to the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.170
 downtown fingers of the hand 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.440
 and with this position we will apply all the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.569
 tonic for the face of balancing 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.700
 again from the ph and removing all possible 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.280
 of the trace of impurities that may come 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.410
 to stay with our hands we will withdraw 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.370
 the excess of tonic so that it does not create a 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.110
 dryness and last step will hydrate 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 I in my case use a technique to know 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.830
 if the hydrated the rest perfectly 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.290
 is to take a quantity and apply six 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 points on the face the cheeks on the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.140
 chin on the nose on the forehead and on 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.569
 the neck 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.400
 we apply it in circular movements and 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.170
 ascending to avoid the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.410
 sagging of the muscles of the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.810
 neck of the skin of the face and already 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.260
 we are finished as you see the three steps 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.810
 are perfect for basic care 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.570
 cleaning then the tonic to recover 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.550
 the ph of our face and finally the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.470
 hydration to keep it juicy and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.410
 hydrated the skin throughout the day 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.069
