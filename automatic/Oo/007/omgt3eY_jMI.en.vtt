 Hello dear buyers want 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:14.309
 we offer sales tablet wexler 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.969
 tab 7b 3g in general model principle 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.760
 not bad 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.460
 will say from pretty interesting herself 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 model to design is interesting what is not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.880
 I liked it when I took it here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 eat as you see and beating the move 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:35.309
 micro sd well, that is, everything is there for 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.430
 headphone is reset it is for charging so 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.829
 that's it for sims 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.350
 that is all this model needs 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 pretty interesting model say 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.129
 so it works everything was bought literally 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.739
 how much do I say now a month and a half 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 back that is basically everything is fine 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.270
 which I really liked at all in this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.489
 models of this are not sensitive enough 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.899
 and the center is generally perfect sensor 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.480
 I think 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.480
 how many different hands did I get there 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.470
 sensory well, there is something there 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.240
 here, as it were, let's be surprised at this 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.030
 plan so basically everything works 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 only nuance 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 but it is fixable that is a nest for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.689
 charge I did not disassemble because 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.200
 I think all the same I don't need it anymore 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.170
 Nathan is not just there is another 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.479
 picked up here it can be parsed in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.979
 principle correct yourself or give 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.810
 service centers there like props 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.840
 just when charging it a little bit 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.000
 tilt goes and the charge goes 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 ok if not about a little bit set 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 as if she might not charge therefore 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.659
 that's how it is one the most nuances but how 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.369
 states this is offset by the price to 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:51.360
 he has boxes there is a document all 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.729
 you need a little charger that is you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.869
 here even when bought that is all that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.250
 need everything there so contact 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.320
 acquire forgive normal ie 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.680
 I'm not complaining about a good tablet 8 hectares 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 memory in it operatives gigabyte process 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.360
 good so pretty shusty 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.440
 but so here 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.190
