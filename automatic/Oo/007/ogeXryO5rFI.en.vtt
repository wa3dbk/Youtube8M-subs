 hello friends I hope they are well my name is motor and today you 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 I will teach how a samsung digital camera works 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:13.749
 first we have a team called camera that its function is basically 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.689
 control the amount and time of light which can record an image in a 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.069
 photosensitive sensor and store it in a memory 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.399
 in order to get an image we must stop a reason for example a panda 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.219
 in the zoo of Chapultepec which is illuminated by natural light and this one 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.339
 reflects that light in all directions as if it were a mirror 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.900
 this light travels in all directions and our camera will collect this light with 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.240
 its first component called lenses which are responsible for giving 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.460
 correct direction this light will direct it to a single point as a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.210
 magnifying glass so our image will not come out pink or distorted 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.730
 all this light that go to a photosensitive sensor called ccd which 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.730
 converts this light into a charge or electrical signal 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.930
 this analog signal is sent to a chip called tc that is responsible for 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.970
 convert this points a digital signal 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.260
 another chip called st which will process the signal code 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.630
 when processed the image is stored on the storage card at the end 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.630
 you can see the result on the lcd screen 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.140
 this is how a digital camera captures an image 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 I hope this information is useful 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.220
 remember that you find the best products in Stanford 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.480
 goodbye friends
