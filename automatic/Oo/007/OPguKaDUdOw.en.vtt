Bryant was a good kicker and I knew he

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
Bryant was a good kicker and I knew he
was<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.960> don't<00:00:22.380> know

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
was going to make that just I don't know

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.170 
was going to make that just I don't know
how<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.710> missed<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.100> kick<00:00:23.369> earlier<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.970> one

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
how we missed that kick earlier that one

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.660 
how we missed that kick earlier that one
kick<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.199> think<00:00:25.830> beginning<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.490> game

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
kick that I think beginning of the game

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580 
kick that I think beginning of the game
if<00:00:27.330> he<00:00:27.510> made<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.869> kick<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.289> would<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.470> never

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
if he made that kick it would have never

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
if he made that kick it would have never
have<00:00:28.800> come<00:00:28.980> down<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.519> late<00:00:29.699> drama<00:00:30.000> anyway

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
have come down to some late drama anyway

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.340 
have come down to some late drama anyway
so<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.009> cancels<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> is

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
so it all cancels out it is what it is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.940 
so it all cancels out it is what it is
going<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.829> game<00:00:36.140> yeah<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> expect<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.890> a

game with the defense as a whole I
thought<00:01:05.880> defense<00:01:06.869> only<00:01:07.020> allowed<00:01:07.320> 16<00:01:07.680> points

enough to win a game if your defense is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.210 
enough to win a game if your defense is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
seeing from him he's looking like a good

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
seeing from him he's looking like a good
steal<00:01:56.549> by<00:01:56.729> linebacker<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.719> got

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
steal by linebacker and I think we got

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
steal by linebacker and I think we got
ourselves<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.710> linebacker<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.460> finally

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
ourselves a linebacker that finally

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.899 
ourselves a linebacker that finally
knows<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.210> he's<00:02:00.299> doing<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> miles<00:02:02.520> Burris

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
knows what he's doing so miles Burris

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.929

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
there now the negative of course would

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.940 
there now the negative of course would
be<00:02:08.099> Greg<00:02:08.729> Knapp<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.500> bit<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> Willie

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
be Greg Knapp and a little bit of Willie

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.710 
be Greg Knapp and a little bit of Willie
Smith<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.520> hard<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.970> pick<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> rookie

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
Smith that's hard to pick on a rookie

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
Smith that's hard to pick on a rookie
but<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> still<00:02:13.230> don't<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:13.470> how

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
but I still don't like how

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
but I still don't like how
we<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.400> rookie<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.330> our<00:02:15.480> right<00:02:15.930> tackle

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
we have a rookie as our right tackle

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.250 
we have a rookie as our right tackle
undrafted<00:02:16.860> guy<00:02:17.190> Joseph<00:02:18.120> Barksdale<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:18.990> cut

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
undrafted guy Joseph Barksdale was cut

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.870 
undrafted guy Joseph Barksdale was cut
because<00:02:19.470> he<00:02:19.680> didn't<00:02:19.860> fit<00:02:19.980> our<00:02:20.100> scheme<00:02:20.400> yet<00:02:20.700> we

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
because he didn't fit our scheme yet we

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.240 
because he didn't fit our scheme yet we
got<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.380> unproven<00:02:22.380> rookie<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.890> our<00:02:23.040> right

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
got a unproven rookie as our right

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.800 
got a unproven rookie as our right
tackle<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.820> its<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.150> annoying<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.660> know

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
tackle and its really annoying to know

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.330 
tackle and its really annoying to know
that<00:02:25.020> our<00:02:25.140> staff<00:02:25.440> couldn't<00:02:26.430> handle<00:02:26.970> Barksdale

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
that our staff couldn't handle Barksdale

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.040 
that our staff couldn't handle Barksdale
so<00:02:29.340> since<00:02:30.030> he's<00:02:30.150> no<00:02:30.270> longer<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> team<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
so since he's no longer the team and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780 
so since he's no longer the team and
Willie<00:02:31.170> Smith<00:02:31.470> comes<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.130> kind<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
Willie Smith comes in it's just kind of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.340 
Willie Smith comes in it's just kind of
tough<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.450> expectations<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
tough to have expectations for the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620 
tough to have expectations for the
offensive<00:02:34.620> line<00:02:34.820> got<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> poem<00:02:36.210> or<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> little

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
offensive line got the poem or a little

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.050 
offensive line got the poem or a little
bit<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.020> running<00:02:37.380> game<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.950> thought<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
bit the running game I thought the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.360 
bit the running game I thought the
running<00:02:39.330> game<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.600> all<00:02:39.780> right<00:02:40.070> at<00:02:41.070> least<00:02:41.160> one

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
running game was all right at least one

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.590 
running game was all right at least one

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
they gave it to Goodson when they gave

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.540 
they gave it to Goodson when they gave
it<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> McFadden<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> got<00:02:43.560> predictable<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.310> I

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
it to McFadden it got predictable but I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.820 
it to McFadden it got predictable but I

an okay day but I thought the Falcons

an okay day but I thought the Falcons

you know we may have lost and yet it may

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.400 
you know we may have lost and yet it may
suck<00:04:27.650> but<00:04:27.760> falcons<00:04:28.760> they<00:04:29.720> are<00:04:29.870> definitely<00:04:30.290> not

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
suck but falcons they are definitely not

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.770 
suck but falcons they are definitely not
the<00:04:30.560> best<00:04:30.800> team<00:04:31.040> in<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.370> NFL<00:04:31.760> just<00:04:32.390> because<00:04:32.660> of

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
the best team in the NFL just because of

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.050 
the best team in the NFL just because of
their<00:04:32.870> record<00:04:33.230> there's<00:04:34.070> still<00:04:34.370> two<00:04:34.700> or<00:04:34.850> three

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
their record there's still two or three

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.910 
their record there's still two or three
teams<00:04:35.330> with<00:04:35.660> at<00:04:35.810> least<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.140> loss<00:04:36.320> or<00:04:36.500> two<00:04:36.650> losses

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
teams with at least a loss or two losses

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.220 
teams with at least a loss or two losses
that<00:04:37.220> are<00:04:37.280> better<00:04:37.490> than<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:37.730> Falcons<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.630> know

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
that are better than the Falcons I know

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.080 
that are better than the Falcons I know
Falcon<00:04:39.710> fans<00:04:39.950> don't<00:04:40.190> want<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.400> admit<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.670> but

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
Falcon fans don't want to admit that but

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.530 
Falcon fans don't want to admit that but
I<00:04:41.380> still<00:04:42.380> think<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.770> Falcons<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.760> may<00:04:43.940> go<00:04:44.090> 14

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
I still think the Falcons you may go 14

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.110 
I still think the Falcons you may go 14
and<00:04:44.690> two<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.990> may<00:04:45.140> go<00:04:45.290> undefeated<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.820> got<00:04:47.000> to
