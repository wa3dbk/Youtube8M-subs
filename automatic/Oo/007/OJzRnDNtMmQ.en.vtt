got one hand so I'm going to put them
back<00:00:59.309> onto<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.000> keyboard<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
back onto the keyboard so this is the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.509 
back onto the keyboard so this is the
cherry<00:01:02.340> keyboard<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.940> cherry<00:01:03.270> MX<00:01:04.199> blues<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
cherry keyboard with cherry MX blues you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.649 
cherry keyboard with cherry MX blues you
got<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> meet<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.360> them<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.540> you've

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
got to meet when you put them in you've

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.770 
got to meet when you put them in you've
got<00:01:06.750> make<00:01:06.990> sure<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> proper<00:01:07.799> push<00:01:08.010> down<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
got make sure that proper push down and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
got make sure that proper push down and
hopefully<00:01:09.780> me<00:01:10.439> pressing<00:01:10.950> F<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.549> going

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
hopefully me pressing F it's not going

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.990 
hopefully me pressing F it's not going
to<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.030> anything<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> recording<00:01:14.490> program

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to do anything to the recording program

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.840 
to do anything to the recording program
i'm<00:01:15.180> using<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.810> microphone<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.040> put<00:01:17.369> g

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
i'm using for my microphone so i put g

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.340 
i'm using for my microphone so i put g
in<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.299> without<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.729> o-ring<00:01:20.729> mod<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
in there without the o-ring mod on it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.170 
in there without the o-ring mod on it
push<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.640> difference<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
push it down so the difference is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.609 
push it down so the difference is
bottoming<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> g<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.930> much<00:01:31.140> cut<00:01:31.409> down

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
bottoming out the g is so much cut down

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.210 
bottoming out the g is so much cut down
louder<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:34.610> just<00:01:35.610> tapping<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:40.040> g<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
louder now just tapping them g is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
louder now just tapping them g is
definitely<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> lot<00:01:41.939> louder<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.509> i<00:01:42.570> definitely

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
definitely a lot louder so i definitely

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
definitely a lot louder so i definitely
recommend<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.500> o-ring<00:01:43.770> mod<00:01:44.159> i'll<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.060> put

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
recommend this o-ring mod i'll now put

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
recommend this o-ring mod i'll now put
the<00:01:46.009> bow<00:01:47.009> ring<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.030> gina<00:01:48.390> i<00:01:49.729> have

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the bow ring back on the gina i have

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.810 
the bow ring back on the gina i have
think<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> hopefully<00:01:56.250> i<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.790> one

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
think so hopefully i can do it with one

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.469 
think so hopefully i can do it with one
hand<00:01:57.530> there's<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> g<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.579> pick<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.299> any

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
hand there's the g and then pick out any

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
hand there's the g and then pick out any
of<00:02:00.659> these<00:02:03.200> probably<00:02:04.200> trying<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.829> while

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
of these probably trying to do it while

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.160 
of these probably trying to do it while
looking<00:02:05.070> through<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.909> camera<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.719> bad<00:02:07.140> idea

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
looking through the camera is a bad idea

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.330 
looking through the camera is a bad idea
and<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.250> gone<00:02:08.340> blurry<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.940> hope<00:02:09.270> you're<00:02:09.450> happy

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
just like that you slide it on and I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390 
just like that you slide it on and I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
recommend when it's on really push it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
recommend when it's on really push it
down<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:24.300> push<00:02:25.170> down<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.560> rubber<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.380> now

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
