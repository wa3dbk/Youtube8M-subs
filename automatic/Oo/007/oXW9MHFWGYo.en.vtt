00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the stain is on there will not absorb as

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.870 
the stain is on there will not absorb as
if<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.299> bare<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> brand-new<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.670> what

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
if it was bare and brand-new and so what

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
if it was bare and brand-new and so what
we're<00:01:36.030> trying<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> accomplish<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we're trying to accomplish here is to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.140 
we're trying to accomplish here is to
fake<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.369> make<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.640> look<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.939> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
fake it to make it look like it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.620 
fake it to make it look like it's
brand-new<00:01:39.630> again<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.390> when<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.509> go

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
brand-new again and so when we go

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.580 
brand-new again and so when we go
through<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:43.979> wipe<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:45.590> lightly

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
through and we wipe it on lightly

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.889 
through and we wipe it on lightly
putting<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:48.180> too<00:01:48.390> heavy<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
putting it on here not too heavy so it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.330 
putting it on here not too heavy so it
doesn't<00:01:49.140> run<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.210> when<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.360> dries<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
doesn't run and when this dries in a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
doesn't run and when this dries in a
couple<00:01:53.640> days<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.329> come<00:01:54.509> back<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.960> we

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
couple days we will come back and we

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.410 
couple days we will come back and we
will<00:01:55.259> start<00:01:55.740> applying<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.700> finish<00:01:57.000> coats<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
will start applying the finish coats of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.440 
will start applying the finish coats of
the<00:01:57.600> polyurethane<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.700> polyurethane<00:01:59.700> is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the polyurethane that polyurethane is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
the polyurethane that polyurethane is
what<00:02:00.719> really<00:02:01.020> gives<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> wearability<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
what really gives it that wearability to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.010 
what really gives it that wearability to
really<00:02:03.210> last<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.840> years<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:06.020> way

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
really last for years and so that way

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.859 
really last for years and so that way
you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:07.409> wash<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.479> even<00:02:09.479> though<00:02:09.599> it'll

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you can also wash it even though it'll

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
you can also wash it even though it'll
look<00:02:10.050> good<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:10.979> stay<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.640> have

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
look good would just stay not you have

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.200 
look good would just stay not you have
to<00:02:11.879> seal<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
to seal that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.880 
to seal that
so<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.570> car<00:02:13.780> paint<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.590> base

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
so just like car paint you have a base

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.110 
so just like car paint you have a base
coat<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> clear<00:02:15.820> coat<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.940> more

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
coat and you have a clear coat for more
