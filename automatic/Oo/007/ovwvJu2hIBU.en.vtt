of advances in smartphones Urania and
screen<00:00:13.350> resolution<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.920> something<00:00:14.100> we

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
screen resolution is something we

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580 
screen resolution is something we
usually<00:00:14.640> always<00:00:15.000> see<00:00:15.420> improvements<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.200> so<00:00:16.530> in

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
usually always see improvements on so in

Nexus 4 and lots of other devices and in
that<00:00:25.770> 2013<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.240> lots<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.810> 1080p

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
that 2013 we had lots of at 1080p

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.439 
that 2013 we had lots of at 1080p
screens<00:00:28.860> such<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.430> Samsung<00:00:29.670> Galaxy<00:00:29.940> s4

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449

the Google Nexus 5 the HTC One the list

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.290 
the Google Nexus 5 the HTC One the list
was<00:00:33.930> endless<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.560> in<00:00:34.680> 2014<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.910> lots<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
was endless now in 2014 there's lots of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.139 
was endless now in 2014 there's lots of
talk<00:00:36.570> around<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.160> 1440p<00:00:38.160> screen<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.790> that's<00:00:38.970> two

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
talk around a 1440p screen so that's two

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.319 
talk around a 1440p screen so that's two
516<00:00:39.870> by<00:00:40.350> 1440<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.430> we're<00:00:41.550> gonna<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.820> looking<00:00:42.090> at

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
516 by 1440 so we're gonna be looking at

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.380 
516 by 1440 so we're gonna be looking at
above<00:00:43.020> 500<00:00:43.920> PPI<00:00:44.370> pixel<00:00:44.790> density<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
above 500 PPI pixel density which is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.549 
above 500 PPI pixel density which is
absolutely<00:00:46.079> insane

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
absolutely insane

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.530 
absolutely insane
so<00:00:47.160> Oppo<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> already<00:00:48.059> announced<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
so Oppo have already announced that

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.490 
so Oppo have already announced that
their<00:00:48.719> next<00:00:48.870> device<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.460> 2<00:00:50.550> 560<00:00:51.270> by

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
their next device will have a 2 560 by

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.229 
their next device will have a 2 560 by
1440<00:00:52.500> resolution<00:00:52.530> screen<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> there's<00:00:54.059> lots

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
1440 resolution screen and there's lots

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
1440 resolution screen and there's lots
of<00:00:54.360> rumors<00:00:54.629> around<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.110> Samsung<00:00:55.469> Galaxy<00:00:55.590> s5

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of rumors around the Samsung Galaxy s5

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.700 
of rumors around the Samsung Galaxy s5
also<00:00:56.550> having<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> same<00:00:57.030> resolution<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.530> how

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
also having the same resolution but how

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
also having the same resolution but how
many<00:00:58.770> pixels<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> too<00:01:00.120> many<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.870> I've

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
many pixels is too many now what I've

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.740 
many pixels is too many now what I've
noticed<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.829> 2013<00:01:02.760> although<00:01:03.270> lots<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
noticed is that in 2013 although lots of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.990 
noticed is that in 2013 although lots of
the<00:01:03.930> devices<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> had<00:01:05.159> larger<00:01:05.580> batteries

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the devices that had larger batteries

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
the devices that had larger batteries
than<00:01:06.240> their<00:01:06.390> predecessors<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.500> had<00:01:07.650> roughly

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
than their predecessors they had roughly

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
than their predecessors they had roughly
about<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> same<00:01:08.490> amount<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.240> usage<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> terms

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
about the same amount of usage in terms

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
about the same amount of usage in terms
of<00:01:10.140> battery<00:01:10.320> life<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.490> instance<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.850> we

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
of battery life so for instance if we

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
of battery life so for instance if we
take<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> Samsung<00:01:12.720> Galaxy<00:01:13.080> devices<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
take the Samsung Galaxy devices the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.850 
take the Samsung Galaxy devices the
Samsung<00:01:14.400> Galaxy<00:01:14.729> s3<00:01:14.820> has<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> 720p<00:01:16.200> screen<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
Samsung Galaxy s3 has a 720p screen and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
battery the Samsung Galaxy s4

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.080 
battery the Samsung Galaxy s4
has<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> 1080p<00:01:21.689> screen<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.939> 2600<00:01:23.939> milliamp

has a 1080p screen with a 2600 milliamp
battery<00:01:24.299> however<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.290> wasn't<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.590> huge<00:01:25.799> deal

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
battery however there wasn't a huge deal

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
battery however there wasn't a huge deal
of<00:01:26.159> difference<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> terms<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.510> battery<00:01:27.780> life

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of difference in terms of battery life

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
of difference in terms of battery life
between<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.830> now<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.460> saying<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
between the two now I'm not saying that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
between the two now I'm not saying that
pixels<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.080> screen<00:01:31.590> resolution<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pixels and a screen resolution are the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.910 
pixels and a screen resolution are the
only<00:01:33.000> factors<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:34.080> towards<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> battery

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
only factors that go towards the battery

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
only factors that go towards the battery
life<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.939> definitely<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
life but they are definitely a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
life but they are definitely a
significant<00:01:37.290> factor<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.100> goes<00:01:38.250> without

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
significant factor and it goes without

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
significant factor and it goes without
saying<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> more<00:01:39.210> pixels<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
saying that the more pixels you have the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.870 
saying that the more pixels you have the
more<00:01:40.560> power<00:01:40.830> you're<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.340> needing<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
more power you're gonna be needing to a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
more power you're gonna be needing to a
power<00:01:42.330> up<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.020> process<00:01:43.229> those<00:01:43.590> pixels

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
power up and that process those pixels

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.319 
power up and that process those pixels
and<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.369> look<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.670> different<00:01:45.119> screen

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and if we look at different screen

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.440 
and if we look at different screen
resolutions<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:46.049> 720p<00:01:46.829> screen<00:01:46.890> has<00:01:47.610> 1280<00:01:48.180> by

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
resolutions a 720p screen has 1280 by

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230 
resolutions a 720p screen has 1280 by
720<00:01:48.869> pixels<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.040> total<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.880> under<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
720 pixels so in total that's under a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.539 
720 pixels so in total that's under a
million<00:01:51.479> pixels<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.140> 1080p<00:01:53.130> screen<00:01:53.400> however

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
million pixels a 1080p screen however

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.749 
million pixels a 1080p screen however
has<00:01:54.030> 1920<00:01:54.780> by<00:01:54.960> 1080<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.220> over<00:01:56.579> 2

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
has 1920 by 1080 so that's over 2

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.980 
has 1920 by 1080 so that's over 2
million<00:01:57.000> pixels<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.540> you're<00:01:57.659> looking<00:01:57.720> at

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
million pixels so you're looking at

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.219 
million pixels so you're looking at
double<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> pixels<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.880> 720p<00:02:00.600> screen<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
double the pixels of a 720p screen and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.929 
double the pixels of a 720p screen and
the<00:02:01.500> further<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.159> go<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:02.610> pixels

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the further up you go the more pixels

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
the further up you go the more pixels
you<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.380> power<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.799> gonna<00:02:04.920> be

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you have the more power you're gonna be

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
you have the more power you're gonna be
needing<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.640> power<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.240> process<00:02:06.659> those

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
needing to power and process those

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.259 
needing to power and process those
pixels<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.099> back<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> example

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
pixels so if you go back to the example

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.110 
pixels so if you go back to the example
of<00:02:09.419> the<00:02:09.479> Galaxy<00:02:10.019> devices<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.829> the<00:02:11.639> Samsung

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
of the Galaxy devices if the Samsung

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.380 
of the Galaxy devices if the Samsung
Galaxy<00:02:12.209> s4<00:02:12.540> had<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
Galaxy s4 had a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.570 
Galaxy s4 had a
20p<00:02:14.020> screen<00:02:14.320> for<00:02:14.500> instance<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:15.430> would

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
20p screen for instance it would

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.220 
20p screen for instance it would
definitely<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.480> longer<00:02:16.870> battery<00:02:16.990> life

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
definitely have a longer battery life

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.230 
definitely have a longer battery life
and<00:02:17.620> some<00:02:17.830> manufacturers<00:02:18.340> such<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:18.820> Motorola

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
and some manufacturers such as Motorola

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.170 
and some manufacturers such as Motorola
for<00:02:19.600> instance<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.380> opted<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.180> 720p

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
for instance have opted for a 720p

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.930 
for instance have opted for a 720p
screen<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.020> Moto<00:02:23.200> X<00:02:23.320> has<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> 720p<00:02:24.670> screen

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
screen so the Moto X has a 720p screen

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000 
screen so the Moto X has a 720p screen
even<00:02:25.300> though<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> flagship<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.470> one

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
even though it is a flagship and one

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.920 
even though it is a flagship and one
thing<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> lot<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.670> users<00:02:28.150> boast<00:02:28.390> about<00:02:28.690> is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
thing that a lot of users boast about is

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.930 
thing that a lot of users boast about is
the<00:02:29.350> tremendous<00:02:29.860> battery<00:02:30.250> life<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.760> get

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the tremendous battery life that you get

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.150 
the tremendous battery life that you get
with<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.210> Moto<00:02:31.480> X<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.440> me<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.830> raises

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
with the Moto X so for me that raises

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.950 
with the Moto X so for me that raises
the<00:02:33.250> question<00:02:33.280> what's<00:02:34.060> more<00:02:34.270> important<00:02:34.810> a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
the question what's more important a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.870 
the question what's more important a
better<00:02:35.230> battery<00:02:35.440> life<00:02:35.650> or<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.100> higher<00:02:36.610> pixel

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
better battery life or a higher pixel

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.640 
better battery life or a higher pixel
resolution<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.840> that's<00:02:38.200> something<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.530> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
resolution and that's something that I
