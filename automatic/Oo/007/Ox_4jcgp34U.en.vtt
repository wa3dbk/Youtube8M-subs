00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.980
 A lot of attention to girls is knowing 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.080
 how considering the girls is with 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.590

 They are very cute 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.650
 and the negatives also everything comes to the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.660
 end you always have to be happy to the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.820
