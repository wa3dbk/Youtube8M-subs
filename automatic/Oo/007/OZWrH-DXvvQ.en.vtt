just got finished with yesterday
we're<00:00:15.780> installing<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.379> tape<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.660> spoke

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
we're installing the tape right I spoke

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
we're installing the tape right I spoke
about<00:00:18.690> leaving<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:20.599> the<00:00:21.599> seat<00:00:21.900> pan<00:00:22.490> retainer

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
about leaving this the seat pan retainer

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.720 
about leaving this the seat pan retainer
in<00:00:24.170> place<00:00:25.170> okay<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.710> factory<00:00:26.130> seat<00:00:26.340> bolts

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
in place okay your factory seat bolts

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.560 
in place okay your factory seat bolts
into<00:00:26.880> these<00:00:27.529> nuts<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
into these nuts right here this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.710 
into these nuts right here this
obviously<00:00:30.960> bolts<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.439> your<00:00:31.529> subframe<00:00:32.720> this

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
obviously bolts to your subframe this

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.370 
obviously bolts to your subframe this
with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> hot<00:00:34.620> bodies<00:00:34.980> race<00:00:35.220> bodywork<00:00:35.760> tail<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
with the hot bodies race bodywork tail I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.840 
with the hot bodies race bodywork tail I
feel<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> pretty<00:00:37.770> important<00:00:38.370> point<00:00:38.520> because

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
feel is a pretty important point because

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670 
feel is a pretty important point because
it<00:00:38.940> closes<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.450> gap<00:00:39.630> between<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> seat<00:00:40.410> pan

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it closes the gap between the seat pan

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.670 
it closes the gap between the seat pan
right<00:00:41.490> and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.120> subframe<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.260> helps<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
right and the subframe it also helps to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.110 
right and the subframe it also helps to
hold<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.040> battery<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.430> place<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.060> not

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
hold your battery in place so it's not

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.720 
hold your battery in place so it's not
bouncing<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.780> around<00:00:45.920> okay<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> end<00:00:47.580> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
bouncing all around okay so in the end I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
bouncing all around okay so in the end I
really<00:00:48.030> believe<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.480> best<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.320> piece

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
really believe it's best if this piece

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.030 
really believe it's best if this piece
is<00:00:49.890> left<00:00:50.130> in<00:00:50.310> there<00:00:50.490> and<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:52.290> initial<00:00:52.680> idea<00:00:52.740> was

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
is left in there and my initial idea was

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.160 
is left in there and my initial idea was
if<00:00:53.520> you're<00:00:53.700> gonna<00:00:53.790> make<00:00:53.970> it<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> race<00:00:54.330> bike<00:00:54.630> only

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
if you're gonna make it a race bike only

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
if you're gonna make it a race bike only
to<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.160> ahead<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.430> basically<00:00:56.850> trim<00:00:57.270> this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to just go ahead and basically trim this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
to just go ahead and basically trim this
right<00:00:57.690> along<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.080> subframe<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> could<00:00:58.770> do

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
right along the subframe you could do

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.680 
right along the subframe you could do
that<00:00:59.040> my<00:00:59.790> circumstance<00:01:00.450> is<00:01:00.660> different

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that my circumstance is different

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
that my circumstance is different
because<00:01:01.200> this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.650> test<00:01:01.980> mule<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.430> going

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because this is a test mule that's going

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.210 
because this is a test mule that's going
from<00:01:02.940> street<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> track<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> street

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
from street to track back to street

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.410 
from street to track back to street
we've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> lot<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> work<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
we've got a lot of work to do on this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
we've got a lot of work to do on this
place<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> need<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.350> able<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> both

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
place so I need to be able to do both

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
place so I need to be able to do both
and<00:01:08.579> I<00:01:08.609> put<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> tail<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.329> with<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.719> in<00:01:09.929> place

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and I put the tail on with this in place

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
and I put the tail on with this in place
and<00:01:10.439> honestly<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.490> difficult<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and honestly it's a little difficult you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
and honestly it's a little difficult you
really<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.359> to<00:01:12.450> stretch<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.929> quite<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.649> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
really got to stretch it quite a bit and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.380 
really got to stretch it quite a bit and
it<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.429> better<00:01:14.579> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.759> didn't<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.149> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it would be better if you didn't have to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.569 
it would be better if you didn't have to
so<00:01:15.799> playing<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.130> us<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.429> bit

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
street mode we would need this upper

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
street mode we would need this upper
piece<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.609> because<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.179> what<00:01:33.630> our

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
piece on there because that is what our

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.669 
piece on there because that is what our
seat<00:01:34.049> bolts<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:35.179> so<00:01:36.179> what<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.359> did<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.289> drilled

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
seat bolts to so what I did is I drilled

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.039 
seat bolts to so what I did is I drilled
through<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:40.700> plastic<00:01:41.700> piece<00:01:41.909> into<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
through the plastic piece into the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.709 
through the plastic piece into the
subframe<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.710> capped<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> subframe<00:01:44.719> to

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
subframe and capped the subframe to

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.039 
subframe and capped the subframe to
accept<00:01:46.170> these<00:01:47.069> fasteners<00:01:47.759> stuff<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.479> had<00:01:48.689> here

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
accept these fasteners stuff I had here

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.440 
accept these fasteners stuff I had here
I<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.950> used<00:01:50.429> fasteners<00:01:51.030> had<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.210> little

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
I actually used fasteners had a little

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
I actually used fasteners had a little
bigger<00:01:51.689> head<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.409> surface<00:01:52.829> area

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
bigger head a little more surface area

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.800 
bigger head a little more surface area
you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.789> see<00:01:53.969> that<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> hold<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> nice<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you can see that to hold it nice and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.719 
you can see that to hold it nice and
tight<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:56.119> you'll<00:01:57.119> remove<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.130> stock<00:01:59.399> once

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
tight now you'll remove the stock once

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.989 
tight now you'll remove the stock once
okay<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.079> remember<00:02:02.069> all<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.639> doing<00:02:02.819> is

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
okay and remember all this is doing is

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.059 
okay and remember all this is doing is

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
holding the seat down your butts on the

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.520 
holding the seat down your butts on the
seat<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.639> all<00:02:05.850> downward<00:02:06.420> pressure<00:02:06.749> right

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
seat so it's all downward pressure right

seat so it's all downward pressure right
you're<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.100> really<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.490> be<00:02:08.550> ripping
