phrasing<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:39.950> your<00:00:40.100> guitar<00:00:40.400> playing<00:00:40.989> today<00:00:41.989> we

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
phrasing to your guitar playing today we

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.950 
phrasing to your guitar playing today we
will<00:00:42.590> be<00:00:42.710> focusing<00:00:42.890> on<00:00:43.430> sitar<00:00:43.970> phrasing<00:00:44.510> using

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
will be focusing on sitar phrasing using

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.829 
will be focusing on sitar phrasing using
microtones<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:45.680> bending<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.360> micro<00:00:47.360> tone<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.809> a

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
microtones and bending a micro tone is a

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.200 
microtones and bending a micro tone is a
note<00:00:48.170> that's<00:00:48.470> in<00:00:48.680> between<00:00:48.800> two<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.489> our<00:00:49.910> nodes

note that's in between two of our nodes
in<00:00:50.480> western<00:00:51.230> music<00:00:51.879> so<00:00:52.879> if<00:00:53.210> we<00:00:53.239> have<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> note

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
in western music so if we have the note

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.860 
in western music so if we have the note
F<00:00:53.960> sharp<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:55.519> we<00:00:55.670> have<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.910> note<00:00:56.059> G<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.570> micro

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
F sharp and we have the note G the micro

F sharp and we have the note G the micro

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
sharp and G now to our Western ears this

sharp and G now to our Western ears this
sounds<00:01:05.119> out<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.270> tune<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.410> Eastern<00:01:06.830> music

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
sounds out of tune but in Eastern music

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.550 
sounds out of tune but in Eastern music
these<00:01:07.550> notes<00:01:07.729> are<00:01:07.910> used<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.240> lot<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:09.170> form<00:01:09.500> of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
these notes are used a lot as a form of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.760 
these notes are used a lot as a form of
phrasing<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.310> deeper<00:01:10.640> form<00:01:10.910> of<00:01:11.090> expression

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
phrasing and a deeper form of expression

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.230 
phrasing and a deeper form of expression
so<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:12.890> order<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.220> get<00:01:13.399> away<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.759> using<00:01:13.970> these

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
so in order to get away with using these

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.120 
so in order to get away with using these
microtones<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:14.990> western<00:01:15.470> music<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.979> not

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
microtones in western music and not

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.310 
microtones in western music and not
sound<00:01:16.430> like<00:01:16.550> you're<00:01:16.700> playing<00:01:16.850> out<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.090> tune

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
sound like you're playing out of tune

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.650 
sound like you're playing out of tune
the<00:01:18.320> best<00:01:18.590> way<00:01:18.800> I<00:01:18.830> feel<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.910> by<00:01:20.420> using

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
the best way I feel to do it is by using

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.930 
the best way I feel to do it is by using
it<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.110> form<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.500> vibrato<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.700> you're<00:01:22.820> not

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
it in the form of vibrato so you're not

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.999 
it in the form of vibrato so you're not
sitting<00:01:23.300> on<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.630> note<00:01:23.810> for<00:01:24.020> too<00:01:24.140> long<00:01:24.380> but

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
sitting on the note for too long but

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.249 
sitting on the note for too long but
you're<00:01:25.160> kind<00:01:25.429> of<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.580> using<00:01:26.539> it<00:01:26.810> for<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> split

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
you're kind of just using it for a split

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.370 
you're kind of just using it for a split
second<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.509> referencing<00:01:29.509> it<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.810> then<00:01:30.140> going

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
second and referencing it and then going

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.830 
second and referencing it and then going
back<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.310> no<00:01:31.670> that's<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:32.030> tune<00:01:32.240> so

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.080 

so<00:01:38.840> what<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.049> did<00:01:39.290> there<00:01:39.619> was<00:01:40.190> I<00:01:40.400> bent<00:01:40.729> from<00:01:40.940> F

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
so what I did there was I bent from F

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.170 
so what I did there was I bent from F
sharp<00:01:41.299> G<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.470> brought<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.830> back<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
sharp G and brought it back to the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.080 
sharp G and brought it back to the
microtonal<00:01:44.780> embassage<00:01:45.380> e<00:01:45.700> rather<00:01:46.700> quickly

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
microtonal embassage e rather quickly

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.350 
microtonal embassage e rather quickly
but<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:47.900> emphasize<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.920> microtome<00:01:49.400> part<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.270> it

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
but I emphasize the microtome part so it

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.520 
but I emphasize the microtome part so it
didn't<00:01:50.570> sound<00:01:50.659> like<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.869> was<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.320> regular

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
didn't sound like it was just a regular

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.840 
didn't sound like it was just a regular
vibrato

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.849 

now<00:02:01.850> being<00:02:02.630> able<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.960> hit<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.259> micro<00:02:03.649> tone

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
now being able to hit this micro tone

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.950 
now being able to hit this micro tone
consistently<00:02:04.850> will<00:02:05.000> take<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.210> lot<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.420> practice

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
consistently will take a lot of practice

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.680 
consistently will take a lot of practice
but<00:02:06.259> also<00:02:06.469> very<00:02:07.250> importantly<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:08.269> takes<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.539> lot

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
but also very importantly it takes a lot

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.359 
but also very importantly it takes a lot
of<00:02:08.720> listening<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.530> would<00:02:09.890> suggest<00:02:10.009> listening

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
of listening I would suggest listening

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.030 
of listening I would suggest listening
to<00:02:10.729> sitar<00:02:11.180> music<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.780> hearing<00:02:12.530> how<00:02:12.739> they

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
to sitar music and hearing how they

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.580 
to sitar music and hearing how they
approach<00:02:13.519> hitting<00:02:14.480> those<00:02:14.569> microtones<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
approach hitting those microtones and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.800 
approach hitting those microtones and
then<00:02:15.739> getting<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.549> again<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.599> form

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
then getting out of it again in the form

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.860 
then getting out of it again in the form
of<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.989> phrase<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.250> practice<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.420> lot<00:02:20.690> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
of a phrase so practice this a lot and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.890 
of a phrase so practice this a lot and
I'll<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.470> next<00:02:21.530> time
