00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.529
 Congratulations uli hoeneß to this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 superior 13 0 against the hsv are 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.849
 one of the happy fingers in the wound 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.679
 that's going to be difficult today or that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.670
 team has except for the small ones 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.009
 difficulties in the first 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.100
 quarter of an hour from one piece 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.539
 we played the hsv totally 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 mastered and I believe the result 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.560
 is also in this you suspect them 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.300
 do not mind if we are the 13 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.350
 0 exemplarily again we look 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230
 Look at us as the back door 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.609
 perspective and see the emergence 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.529
 bastian schweinsteiger then there is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.559
 this is your quick double pass 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.390
 between ribéry and big they think in 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.149
 the moment halleluja what we have none 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 quality 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 it just makes the team happy 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 to watch as if it is released 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.809
 if you let them play and if they are 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 just goes in leadership then the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.050
 Football art almost and it's beautiful 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 Of course , watching is also fun 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.660
 how to watch for half an hour 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.789
 can be without major monkeys burden 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.739
 the mood then the better if they are the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.210
 already know results and know that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.460
 the pursuers do not really catch up 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.930
 could today yes I think that has the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.479
 team, of course, in advance 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 already knew that the others easily 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.659
 have messed up and of course that gives 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.250
 even more self-confidence and thereby 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.710
 the nerve burden is not quite so 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 big and that was why it was pretty clear 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.590
 we want here would go into management 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.000
 that the team would then occur 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 and it has also made them had 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.590
 before the hsv warned you have them 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.270
 also outed as hsv fan but last 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 endes what was very clear that was 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.400
 because their team was too concentrated 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.170
 and not at all 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 Maybe something has been admitted 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.970
 downplay or by any 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.810
 arrogance to show something 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.829
 arrogant is our team in the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 not at all 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.570
 I think that the results of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.439
 of course very inspiring in the afternoons 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 have worked 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.000
 they all get it with me and me 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.740
 I'm sure that's the coach 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 of course, within or before that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 play has briefly addressed that one 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.049
 should take over such a steep template 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 another thing because they are straight 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.290
 inspirational says a former 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.149
 employee of them louis van gaal 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 has verbally followed this week 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.140
 has, among other things, their claim to power 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.630
 she criticized that at fc bavaria 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.969
 met 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.369
 I have the whole week to these 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.040
 said nothing in this interview 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.050
 I'll leave it, I think 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.630
 not the comments of reputable 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.569
 Newspapers read this week 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.800
 then it was enough for me yes 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.310
 some also jumped in the breach 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.470
 for her 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.060
 sammer heynckes what would have 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.310
 happen so louis van gaal normal 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.220
 I get job from fc bavaria 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.380
 It may be that we talk about this topic 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.330
 I do not speak anymore and I believe that 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.840
 I'm well advised that too 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.849
 divide 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.709
 that stands in principle also for itself 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.709
 Thanks a lot, thank you
