because<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.969> can<00:00:47.149> get<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.359> lot<00:00:47.600> more<00:00:48.309> time

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309

because we can get a lot more time
actually<00:00:49.670> producing<00:00:50.800> gold<00:00:52.179> if<00:00:53.179> we<00:00:53.420> were<00:00:53.600> to

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
actually producing gold if we were to

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.529 
actually producing gold if we were to
get<00:00:54.350> all<00:00:54.499> the<00:00:54.710> fine<00:00:54.949> stuff<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:55.999> this<00:00:56.179> is<00:00:56.359> how<00:00:56.480> we

takes the majority of the concentrate
heavy<00:04:30.500> stuff<00:04:31.040> which<00:04:31.730> then<00:04:31.940> overflows<00:04:32.540> into<00:04:32.900> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
heavy stuff which then overflows into a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.230 
heavy stuff which then overflows into a
second<00:04:33.500> container<00:04:33.920> which<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.190> under<00:04:34.700> the
