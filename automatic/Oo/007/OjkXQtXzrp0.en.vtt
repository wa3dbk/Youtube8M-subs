00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
had was they would come in we had body

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
had was they would come in we had body
weight<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:43.920> had<00:00:44.100> height<00:00:44.899> body<00:00:45.899> fat<00:00:46.170> percentage

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
weight we had height body fat percentage

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.319 
weight we had height body fat percentage
we<00:00:47.640> also<00:00:47.820> had<00:00:48.300> grip<00:00:48.690> tests<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:50.300> followed<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
we also had grip tests and followed that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.650 
we also had grip tests and followed that
by<00:00:51.750> power<00:00:52.020> bench<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.699> bit<00:00:53.879> more<00:00:54.180> than

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
by power bench so a little bit more than

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
by power bench so a little bit more than
your<00:00:54.870> traditional<00:00:55.170> bench<00:00:55.710> press<00:00:56.010> we're

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
your traditional bench press we're

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.860 
your traditional bench press we're
looking<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.610> how<00:00:56.789> fast<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.449> move<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
looking at how fast they can move the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
looking at how fast they can move the
bar<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> measuring<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> device<00:00:59.570> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
bar and measuring that with a device so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
bar and measuring that with a device so
really<00:01:00.809> looking<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.410> powerfully<00:01:02.340> they

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
really looking at how powerfully they

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.109 
really looking at how powerfully they
can<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.149> move<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.049> weight<00:01:04.850> from<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can they can move the weight from that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.030 
can they can move the weight from that
they<00:01:06.330> went<00:01:06.510> over<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> high<00:01:07.080> trainer<00:01:07.470> where

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
they went over to the high trainer where

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
they went over to the high trainer where
we<00:01:08.970> did<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> 20<00:01:09.450> metre<00:01:09.540> sprint<00:01:09.810> measuring<00:01:10.560> all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
we did a 20 metre sprint measuring all

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
we did a 20 metre sprint measuring all
kinds<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.070> things<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.900> peak<00:01:12.900> power<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:14.240> their

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
kinds of things from peak power to their

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
kinds of things from peak power to their
peak<00:01:15.479> speed<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.770> complete<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
peak speed to the time to complete the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
peak speed to the time to complete the
20<00:01:17.610> meters<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.330> right<00:01:18.570> leg<00:01:18.810> versus<00:01:19.170> left<00:01:19.470> leg

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
20 meters to right leg versus left leg

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
20 meters to right leg versus left leg
so<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> lot<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> good<00:01:21.150> data<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
so we get a lot of good data out of that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
so we get a lot of good data out of that
as<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.500> look<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> power<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.280> they

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
as well to look at the power that they

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
as well to look at the power that they
can<00:01:23.520> produce<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.689> lower<00:01:24.840> body<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
can produce in the lower body which is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.310 
can produce in the lower body which is
obviously<00:01:25.950> important<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.549> hockey<00:01:26.790> players

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
obviously important for hockey players

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.810 
obviously important for hockey players
this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.500> patrick's<00:01:28.979> first<00:01:29.220> year<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this is patrick's first year with the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
this is patrick's first year with the
Hamilton<00:01:30.299> Bulldogs<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.290> he's<00:01:31.409> no<00:01:31.619> stranger

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
Hamilton Bulldogs but he's no stranger

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.429 
Hamilton Bulldogs but he's no stranger
to<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.430> sport<00:01:32.820> he<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.810> McGill<00:01:34.140> hockey

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to the sport he was with McGill hockey

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.830 
to the sport he was with McGill hockey
for<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> past<00:01:35.130> six<00:01:35.460> years<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> knows<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
for the past six years and knows that in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.890 
for the past six years and knows that in
this<00:01:36.990> sport<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:38.070> offseason<00:01:38.900> shape

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this sport there is no offseason shape

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.240 
this sport there is no offseason shape
but<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.200> sure<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.560> were<00:01:40.680> players<00:01:40.979> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
but I'm sure there were players that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
but I'm sure there were players that
took<00:01:41.400> advantage<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.090> but

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
took advantage of the time off but

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.789 
took advantage of the time off but
nowadays<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.649> mean<00:01:45.320> there's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> lot<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:46.560> at

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
nowadays I mean there's a lot more at

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.039 
nowadays I mean there's a lot more at
stake<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.520> terms<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> making<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.299> teams<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
stake in terms of making the teams and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.020 
stake in terms of making the teams and
obviously<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.950> finance<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.490> involved<00:01:50.909> in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
obviously the finance is involved in

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.240 
obviously the finance is involved in
that<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> big<00:01:52.140> business<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.770> I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that so it's a big business now and I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
that so it's a big business now and I
mean<00:01:53.700> players<00:01:53.970> come<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> extremely<00:01:54.720> prepared

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
mean players come in extremely prepared

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.639 
mean players come in extremely prepared
and<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.869> know<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.500> very

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and if they don't know it's not very

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.109 
and if they don't know it's not very
acceptable<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.490> sure<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.880> there's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
acceptable for sure because there's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
acceptable for sure because there's
unless<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.990> come<00:02:01.229> they've<00:02:01.530> come<00:02:01.770> off<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> very

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
unless they come they've come off a very

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.469 
unless they come they've come off a very
short<00:02:02.610> offseason<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:04.460> perhaps<00:02:05.460> they've<00:02:06.329> had

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
short offseason or perhaps they've had

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.690 
short offseason or perhaps they've had
an<00:02:06.630> injury<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.220> that's<00:02:08.520> something

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
an injury then you know that's something

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.830 
an injury then you know that's something
that<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.149> maybe<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.750> more

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that is maybe a little bit more

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.110 
that is maybe a little bit more
excusable<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:11.039> general<00:02:11.340> sense<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.819> expect

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
excusable but in general sense we expect

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.380 
excusable but in general sense we expect
them<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.360> come<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.930> top<00:02:13.140> shape

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
them to come in and in top shape

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.000 
them to come in and in top shape
everything<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.599> here<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.230> highly<00:02:16.739> geared

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
everything they do here is highly geared

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.070 
everything they do here is highly geared
towards<00:02:17.489> finding<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.060> status<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.810> player's

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
towards finding the status of a player's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.290 
towards finding the status of a player's
physical<00:02:19.620> fitness<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:20.700> don't<00:02:20.819> get<00:02:21.030> lost

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
physical fitness so they don't get lost

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.910 
physical fitness so they don't get lost
in<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> system<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.940> basically<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.920> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
in the system it's basically to to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.760 
in the system it's basically to to
decipher<00:02:26.459> who<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> risk<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.560> can

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
decipher who is at a risk and we can

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.339 
decipher who is at a risk and we can
find<00:02:29.459> things<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.090> would<00:02:30.360> maybe<00:02:30.569> later<00:02:30.959> lead

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
find things that would maybe later lead

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.030 
find things that would maybe later lead
to<00:02:31.680> an<00:02:31.830> injury<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.019> if<00:02:34.019> we<00:02:34.200> catch<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.650> before

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to an injury and if we catch that before

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.089 
to an injury and if we catch that before
time<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:36.260> give<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.290> person<00:02:37.680> more

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
time then we can give that person more

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.130 
time then we can give that person more
adaptive<00:02:38.670> capacity<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.510> deal<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
adaptive capacity to deal with the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.400 
adaptive capacity to deal with the
stresses<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.519> see<00:02:41.730> in

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
stresses that that you see in

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.860 
stresses that that you see in
professional<00:02:43.410> sports<00:02:43.560> people<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.819> we<00:02:45.120> we

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
professional sports people that we we

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
professional sports people that we we
have<00:02:46.140> hopes<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:47.040> them<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.640> move<00:02:47.760> up<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
have hopes for them to move up to the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.660 
have hopes for them to move up to the
higher<00:02:48.269> level<00:02:48.780> obviously<00:02:49.250> we<00:02:50.250> want<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.550> put

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
higher level obviously we want to put

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.030 
higher level obviously we want to put
energy<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.330> help<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.959> kind<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.349> develop<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
energy and help them kind of develop to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.500 
energy and help them kind of develop to
their<00:02:53.129> full<00:02:53.190> potential<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.940> by<00:02:54.120> doing<00:02:54.330> these

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
their full potential and by doing these

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.479 
their full potential and by doing these
tests<00:02:54.900> we're<00:02:55.019> able<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.319> see<00:02:55.530> where<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.370> have

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
tests we're able to see where they have

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.550 
tests we're able to see where they have
deficiencies<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.540> where<00:02:58.019> they<00:02:58.170> really<00:02:58.409> need

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
deficiencies and where they really need

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.330 
deficiencies and where they really need
to<00:02:58.680> put<00:02:58.830> some<00:02:58.980> work<00:02:59.159> into<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:01.080> we've<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.220> know

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
to put some work into so we've you know

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.460 
to put some work into so we've you know
I<00:03:02.580> think<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.269> data<00:03:03.540> collection<00:03:04.019> has<00:03:04.170> really

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
I think the data collection has really

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.160 
I think the data collection has really
changed<00:03:04.739> over<00:03:05.129> time<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.790> now<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.629> get<00:03:06.959> some

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
changed over time but now we get some

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.710 
changed over time but now we get some
really<00:03:07.530> good<00:03:07.650> data<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.250> kind<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.459> help<00:03:08.580> us<00:03:08.819> know

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
really good data to kind of help us know

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.600 
really good data to kind of help us know
what<00:03:10.409> they<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.920> work<00:03:11.129> on<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.459> they're

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
what they have to work on if they're

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.690 
what they have to work on if they're
going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.819> go<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> next<00:03:12.239> level
