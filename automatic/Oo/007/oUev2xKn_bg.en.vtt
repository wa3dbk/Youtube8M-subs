the<00:01:01.170> time<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.739> gave<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.530> average

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the time I gave it kind of a average

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.190 
the time I gave it kind of a average
rating<00:01:06.260> but<00:01:07.260> since<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> time<00:01:09.350> I've<00:01:10.350> had<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.740 
rating but since that time I've had the
guitar<00:01:13.200> set<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.520> strain<00:01:17.520> gauge<00:01:17.790> on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
guitar set up it's the strain gauge on

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
guitar set up it's the strain gauge on
it<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> string<00:01:19.710> gauge<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.369> used

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.940 
it now is the string gauge that I'm used
to<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:23.210> playing<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> plays<00:01:30.950> plays

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this I'll give you a little dent this is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:51.550 
this I'll give you a little dent this is
on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> neck<00:01:38.520> pickup<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> both<00:01:43.350> pickups

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.460 

anyway<00:01:54.530> now<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:57.440> set<00:01:58.440> up

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
anyway now that I have it set up

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.790 
anyway now that I have it set up
properly<00:01:58.970> I<00:02:01.130> like<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.310> better

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
properly I like it better

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.880 
properly I like it better
these<00:02:04.800> telecasters<00:02:06.409> are<00:02:07.409> kind<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.680> tricky

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
these telecasters are kind of tricky

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
these telecasters are kind of tricky
because<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:09.360> saddles<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.289> here<00:02:11.450> you'll

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
because the saddles right here you'll

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.809 
because the saddles right here you'll
notice<00:02:12.720> there's<00:02:12.930> three<00:02:12.959> saddles<00:02:13.650> yet<00:02:14.610> there's

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
notice there's three saddles yet there's

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.350 
notice there's three saddles yet there's
six<00:02:15.060> strength<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.330> setting<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
six strength and so setting the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.110 
six strength and so setting the
intonation<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.320> these<00:02:19.950> there's<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.910> little

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
intonation on these there's a little

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.970 
intonation on these there's a little
trickier<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> strat

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
trickier because if you have a strat

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.360 
trickier because if you have a strat
you'd<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:24.209> saddle<00:02:24.570> per<00:02:25.560> string<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.250> is

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you'd have one saddle per string this is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.610 
you'd have one saddle per string this is
three<00:02:26.610> saddles<00:02:27.090> six<00:02:27.540> strings<00:02:27.840> that's<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
three saddles six strings that's a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.620 
three saddles six strings that's a
little<00:02:28.769> tricky<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.880> guy<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.090> sets<00:02:30.480> up

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
little tricky with the guy that sets up

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.890 
little tricky with the guy that sets up
my<00:02:31.790> guitar<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:32.820> me<00:02:37.459> told<00:02:38.459> me<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.790> uh<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.630> can

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
my guitar for me told me that uh you can

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.400 
my guitar for me told me that uh you can
get<00:02:40.190> aftermarket<00:02:41.190> saddles<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.480> Telecasters

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
get aftermarket saddles for Telecasters

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.050 
get aftermarket saddles for Telecasters
where<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.800> would<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.100> individual<00:02:44.700> silence

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
where you would have individual silence

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.270 
where you would have individual silence
but<00:02:45.750> anyway<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:52.280> fender

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
but anyway this is the the fender

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.310 
but anyway this is the the fender
telecaster<00:02:54.090> highway<00:02:54.510> one<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.870> now<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
telecaster highway one and now that the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.449 
telecaster highway one and now that the
it's<00:03:04.320> been<00:03:04.590> set<00:03:04.890> up

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
it's been set up

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.479 
it's been set up
I'm<00:03:06.000> liking<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.450> lot<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:08.010> for

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
I'm liking a lot more this is for

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.690 
I'm liking a lot more this is for
example<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> bridge<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:11.610> know

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
example this is a bridge with you know

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:34.570 
example this is a bridge with you know
the<00:03:11.820> tone<00:03:12.060> all<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.420> way<00:03:12.510> down

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:53.699 

neck

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.050 

so<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:55.450> like<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.480> more<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.610> first<00:03:58.850> time

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
so I like it more so the the first time

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.170 
so I like it more so the the first time
I<00:04:01.480> rated<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.690> thing<00:04:03.580> without<00:04:04.580> being<00:04:04.730> setup

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
I rated this thing without being setup

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.150 
I rated this thing without being setup
without<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.660> right<00:04:06.069> string<00:04:07.069> gauge<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:09.010> gave<00:04:10.010> it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
without the right string gauge I gave it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.330 
without the right string gauge I gave it
a<00:04:10.220> 3<00:04:10.330> on<00:04:11.330> a<00:04:11.980> 1<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.010> 5<00:04:13.480> but<00:04:14.480> now<00:04:15.410> that<00:04:15.620> setup<00:04:16.100> and

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
I think I told you before that in this

under<00:04:36.080> nose<00:04:36.350> for<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.590> charity<00:04:36.950> event<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.280> I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
under nose for a charity event and I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.860 
under nose for a charity event and I
think<00:04:37.610> that's<00:04:37.789> because<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.210> signature<00:04:38.539> which

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
think that's because the signature which

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.950 
think that's because the signature which
don't<00:04:39.530> care<00:04:39.710> about<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.919> signature<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:41.450> I

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
don't care about the signature but I

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.120 
don't care about the signature but I
think<00:04:44.710> for<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.860> for<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.460> money<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.910> spin<00:04:47.240> for

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
think for the for the money you spin for

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.010 
think for the for the money you spin for
$800<00:04:49.130> if<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.460> were<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.640> buy<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:49.850> new<00:04:50.090> or<00:04:50.120> 600<00:04:50.900> or

$800 if you were to buy it new or 600 or

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.960
