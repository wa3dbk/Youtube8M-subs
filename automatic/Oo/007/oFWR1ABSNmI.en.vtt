what we're looking at now is we're
looking<00:00:08.940> at<00:00:09.059> flat<00:00:09.360> iron<00:00:09.570> first<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.230> all<00:00:10.290> what

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
looking at flat iron first of all what

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.440 
looking at flat iron first of all what
I'm<00:00:10.500> going<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> suggest<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.160> Holly<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.820> that

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
I'm going to suggest the Holly is that

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.930 
I'm going to suggest the Holly is that
you<00:00:12.570> section<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.889> rather<00:00:14.130> than<00:00:14.370> taking<00:00:14.670> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
you section this so rather than taking a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
you section this so rather than taking a
big<00:00:15.150> section<00:00:15.540> watch<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.139> happens<00:00:16.500> when<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
big section watch what happens when I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.490 
big section watch what happens when I
take<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> big<00:00:17.550> section<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.449> can<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.140> see

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
take a big section like this can you see

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.920 
take a big section like this can you see
I'm<00:00:19.650> pinching<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.340> hair<00:00:20.550> from<00:00:20.730> underneath

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
I'm pinching the hair from underneath

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.939 
I'm pinching the hair from underneath
see<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.470> I'm<00:00:22.560> doing<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.859> I'm

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
see that so what I'm doing is I'm

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.380 
see that so what I'm doing is I'm
creating<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.310> line<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> crease<00:00:23.910> underneath

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
creating a line or a crease underneath

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.050 
creating a line or a crease underneath
what<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
what you're going to do is I'm going to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960 
what you're going to do is I'm going to
suggest<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.750> section<00:00:28.230> diagonal<00:00:28.769> back<00:00:28.980> okay

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
suggest you section diagonal back okay

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.179 
suggest you section diagonal back okay
then<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:31.080> way<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.470> hair<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> fall

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
then that way the hair is going to fall

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
then that way the hair is going to fall
in<00:00:32.369> its<00:00:32.489> natural<00:00:32.700> falling<00:00:33.329> position<00:00:33.750> now

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
in its natural falling position now

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240 
in its natural falling position now
watch<00:00:34.050> I'm<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> look<00:00:34.770> at<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> teeth<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
watch I'm going to look at the teeth of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
watch I'm going to look at the teeth of
the<00:00:35.340> comb<00:00:35.489> teeth<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> comb<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.780> flat

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the comb teeth of the comb are up flat

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
the comb teeth of the comb are up flat
iron<00:00:37.710> comes<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> start<00:00:38.670> moving<00:00:38.879> even<00:00:39.840> before

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
iron comes in I start moving even before

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.560 
iron comes in I start moving even before
I<00:00:40.200> start<00:00:40.530> closing<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.059> how<00:00:42.149> slow

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I start closing and now look at how slow

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.229 
I start closing and now look at how slow
I'm<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> comb<00:00:44.370> leads<00:00:44.940> me

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I'm going and look how the comb leads me

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.500 
I'm going and look how the comb leads me
now<00:00:45.629> watch<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:46.050> bevel<00:00:46.410> bevel<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
now watch me bevel bevel now look at the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.910 
now watch me bevel bevel now look at the
movement<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.170> movement<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.800> out

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
movement look at the movement I got out

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.470 
movement look at the movement I got out
of<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> right<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of that see that right look at this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
of that see that right look at this
section<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.500> look<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.949> section

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
section when you look at that section

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.220 
section when you look at that section
look<00:00:54.120> how<00:00:54.270> I'm<00:00:54.390> getting<00:00:54.510> movement<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
look how I'm getting movement out of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.010 
look how I'm getting movement out of
that<00:00:55.440> rather<00:00:56.039> than<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.520> taking<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.480> big<00:00:57.690> clump

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that rather than me taking the big clump

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.200 
that rather than me taking the big clump
at<00:00:58.140> once<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:59.100> doing<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.730> flat

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
at once all I'm doing is just flat

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
at once all I'm doing is just flat
flatting<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> top<00:01:01.289> surface<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.609> see

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
flatting that top surface you can see

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.299 
flatting that top surface you can see
I'm<00:01:03.030> affecting<00:01:03.570> everything<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.470> diagonal

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I'm affecting everything here diagonal

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.960 
I'm affecting everything here diagonal
back<00:01:05.549> another<00:01:06.270> slice<00:01:07.369> okay<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.549> watch<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
back another slice okay now watch the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
back another slice okay now watch the
comb<00:01:09.180> comb<00:01:09.479> comes<00:01:09.780> underneath<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.130> take

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
comb comb comes underneath and I take

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.890 
comb comb comes underneath and I take
what<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.790> handle<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.630> divide<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
what I can handle see I just divide that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.130 
what I can handle see I just divide that
in<00:01:13.200> half<00:01:13.229> there<00:01:14.070> compress<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.720> look<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.049> my

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
in half there compress now look what my
