00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 i want to come to my second use of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 the storm video after I join you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.660
 Last time the basics about the game 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 you would like to have introduced yourself today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.950
 show one of the five maps and that the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.389
 first it's gardens terror and us 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.799
 just jump into the game and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.750
 look at the whole thing I have one 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.609
 little bit prepared and see 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.060
 you all clear the game is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.070
 pausiert and although there are on this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 this map has three different lions one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.949
 top line a middle in a bot lane 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.960
 we have a total of eight mercenary camps 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.780
 I'll show you the same and it works 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.899
 because you saw mine collects which one 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.570
 team has collected 100 seeds first 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.920
 a garden terror take over a very 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.719
 very strong is monster that is the one 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.020
 own hero of your own champion 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 then turns into that big one 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.160
 Garden plants monsters and get 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 new skills that help you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.719
 what to break the enemy base 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.399
 for skills that are exactly I show 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 So now we're going back to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 play and see 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 i already have this garden terror 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.250
 taken over as I said you collect 117 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.049
 can take one controls it all the way 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 normal as their own hero and that 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.619
 a right-click moves you to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 seen clear in front 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.799
 we have three different spells that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 is once before queens koers and so 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.970
 advertising circle offenbach arises there 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 lonely and every opponent keeps that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.659
 it will run for three seconds in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.960
 the sleep is transformed and slowed down 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.360
 In addition, the w is even the terror or 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 big 15 seconds cool down in the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 i can also just over 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.299
 we will see the range is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.060
 huge and what makes this clean 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.829
 first small plant and the grabs 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.540
 makes all the building roots in the searcher 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.549
 Damage with time it also works 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.860
 minions no harm though 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.020
 opposing heroes and us, of course 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.149
 It is very important that you use it easily 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.950
 to quickly attack the opposing sector 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.899
 tear down for additional experience 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.640
 and to push our game forward 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.680
 the third magic in the the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 GartenstÃ¤dter has is the sprint 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.380
 cooldown 40 seconds that gives you one 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.149
 easy and 30% in speedboot leads trip 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 Customers use the same time so run 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.629
 I normally and now the newly activated 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 seen like a small vapor cloud 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.300
 behind me and moves me relatively 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.430
 fast 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 the garden perron holds for one and a half 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.270
 minutes if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.310
 and in time you have to try yes 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.680
 to knock out the maximum benefit 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.099
 Should the garden die or terror 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.250
 The time will be quite normal 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.110
 with the hp and the man at the pool the man 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 When you terrorized this garden 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 got kicked out again that 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.440
 means you should be careful that you are 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390
 maybe the worst situation 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.190
 that is short of steptoe 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.739
 the time might expire rather 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.390
 to search the wide 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.430
 Now we have time the map again 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.150
 to look at the big one and we see 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.489
 all right 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.800
 as mentioned at the beginning 3 lions 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.230
 once the top lane once with layman 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.790
 and once the bot line with larry 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.500
 cams21 on the top half of the map and 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.629
 a hard camp and the whole thing is 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.890
 of course, it remains mirrored 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.200
 the lower side that is also called here 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.959
 we have two easy camps and a hard one 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.519
 camp and that was actually important 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.260
 What you have to say that you can do this 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.060
 The seeds you need that will you down 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.790
 displayed how many each team has not 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.280
 at all times collect all but 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.959
 a few minutes, so to speak, breaks the night 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.239
 then a little darling and two 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.000
 bronze that is, we have here in draws 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.400
 camp here moves in camp and here in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.120
 this beautiful stone circle because of the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.590
 boss who gives many ladies and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.220
 you just have to be just about normal 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.739
 the seeds overflow and get like that 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.250
 this discounter high as soon as 100 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.269
 is one can take the seeds and that 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.159
 Game win the garden terry 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.540
 take over 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.689
 and, of course, further up 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.110
 play a bit mmr 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:01.540
 sat now we see again that 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.489
 we wait until the night breaks 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.739
 and we are a little bit faster the old eight 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.860
 backbeats here is the big boss 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.769
 curious that one has here once window 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.910
 on the minimap and down here 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.680
 and these are the little fights 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.930
 Kleinkems can be so wonderful clarify 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.639
 no problem 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.100
 with the bosses you should already be too 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.949
 two or three make ear and it 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.419
 Of course, fight always arises 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:35.960
 because both teams necessarily have this garden 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:37.700
 animals want to have 550 and if you want 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.040
 this fund at the with then he pushes 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.910
 even men men get hurt 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.930
 and always so when he dies 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.260
 but there for a big one 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.260
 celebration 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.560
 explodes in a thousand seeds my art 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.560
 also relatively back on the back 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.400
 seen 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.900
 we have 100 sees the garden terror 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.050
 I know sometimes and where can I go 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.460
 must then collect the wait briefly 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.300
 You can just go back to the here 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.960
 homebase go the terrorist and right 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.860
 click to take control shortly 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.320
 I'm already the garden door 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.280
 there it was with today's video I 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.600
 hope you switched on again tomorrow 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.590
 if we look at the next map 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.270
 are just the basics 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.130
 gradually we are getting deeper in 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.680
 I bosnia the matter from here 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.570
 have something like to leave comments 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.260
 is rewrites the channel and we see 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.260
 Tomorrow makes us good
