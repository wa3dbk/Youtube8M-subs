00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.480
 name is Alexei Chernyshov you are watching the channel 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.289
 son father 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.369
 toys today's video is some 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 experiment 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.220
 it down so of course on the live channel 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.130
 but for more effect I will leave it 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.190
 here on the main channel the other day me 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.430
 an invitation came to participate in one 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.010
 project and I thought why not 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.300
 together with different bloggers we decided 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.450
 shoot a video so where each of us 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.880
 answer a series of questions after meeting 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.180
 take a closer look at my video 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.470
 look at the description and read 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.040
 videos of other project participants and i 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.789
 I start and so the first question is what is the first 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.670
 video you posted on the network no matter how 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.939
 Paradoxically it was but a first review at the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.030
 I was on the channel about mega bloks not 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.030
 strait he by the way still lies at 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 me on the channel and reminds me how not 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.899
 to do and I put him on August 5 and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.409
 almost a month later on the son of a father channel and 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:33.880
 toys appeared first review on lego 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.579
 and it was a 10 series 2 figurine just 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.909
 which I need to answer sounds like 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:43.960
 how much time do you spend shooting 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.659
 montage when where and how often you shoot 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.170
 Well, let's go in order of time 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.859
 filming and editing I have a lot of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.100
 two to six hours per first review 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.850
 I open a set of a figure or another 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.569
 a toy 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.079
 studying it and only then I write the text 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:08.350
 after which I film the video 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.320
 I shoot and voiced by the video I'm at home 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.069
 sometimes it seems to me that the neighbors will soon 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.470
 go crazy with my text 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.560
 reviews I try to do three times in 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.879
 week on tuesday product reviews 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.370
 technologist on Fridays reviews on different 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.269
 the designers about the resurrection I left for 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.239
 random reviews for different toys 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:38.319
 models and so on as a camera i 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.890
 I use my camera nikon d7000 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.950
 for lighting ordinary table lamps 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.889
 and as I became unfinished 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.079
 bar stool i will initially take off on 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.349
 regular laptop desk 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.510
 this is evident in my first review then I 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.329
 I thought that you need to rotate toys and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.349
 show them from all sides and i did 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.760
 if in a rotating base and pasted it 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.459
 white cardboard 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.849
 I need to very soon I realized that I can not 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.090
 so work and bought a bar table but 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:17.019
 I did not screw the seat but attached 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.530
 there the board and pasted over and black film 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.430
 and the second board is white for two options. 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.459
 background black and white respectively still 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.859
 one question sounded like channel what 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.889
 topics you look at youtube 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.829
 in fact I watch a lot of things 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.690
 and completely from different subjects well 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.810
 first of all bloggers 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.479
 from the media group shave bros each one 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.720
 in a certain direction is for 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:50.109
 I'm a maniac for what you need to strive for and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.199
 I'm glad that I am familiar with these guys 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.919
 and not personal need also say something about 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:59.459
 what I think about the current state and 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.799
 the development of youtube in Russia 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.659
 Lego direction I think everything in 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.629
 this plan moves in the right 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.359
 direction and this is good news 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.540

 so what are the plans for the dish 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.199
 my perspective has a lot of plans but I 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.900
 I work on the principle 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.310

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.160

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.669
 has a disgusting property not 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.370
 come true 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.680
 Well, my main plan for the nearest 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.919
 the prospect is to gather an army 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.039
