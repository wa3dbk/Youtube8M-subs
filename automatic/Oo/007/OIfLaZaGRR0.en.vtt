00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
sense of what some of these things are

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.680 
sense of what some of these things are
that<00:00:08.519> might<00:00:08.700> be<00:00:08.820> causing<00:00:09.030> reactions<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
that might be causing reactions and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.690 
that might be causing reactions and
where<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.230> go<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.410> then<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.429> want<00:00:11.639> to

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
where you can go and then we want to

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.610 
where you can go and then we want to
really<00:00:11.880> focus<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.570> what<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.469> and

really focus on what you can do and
that's<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:13.889> today<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.130> all<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:15.179> good

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
that's what today is all about what good

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.300 
that's what today is all about what good
foods<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.139> introduce<00:00:16.320> good<00:00:16.800> ways<00:00:17.039> you

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
foods you can introduce good ways you

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.830 
foods you can introduce good ways you
can<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.670> nutrients<00:00:18.210> into<00:00:18.330> your<00:00:18.390> kids<00:00:18.600> good

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
can get nutrients into your kids good

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.359 
can get nutrients into your kids good
ways<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.410> prepare<00:00:19.560> foods<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> they

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
ways you can prepare foods that they

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.220 
ways you can prepare foods that they
like<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.880> that's<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.810> want<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> spend

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
like so that's what we want to spend

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.529 
like so that's what we want to spend
more<00:00:22.320> time<00:00:22.800> focused<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.330> there's

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
more time focused on I know that there's

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.970 
more time focused on I know that there's
that<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> other<00:00:25.590> part<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that just the other part of this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
that just the other part of this
discussion<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.910> natural<00:00:27.090> peace

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
discussion is just a natural peace

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.910 
discussion is just a natural peace
because<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.140> things<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.529> often<00:00:28.680> need

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
because there are things we often need

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
because there are things we often need
to<00:00:29.010> eliminate<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
to eliminate but really what we want to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840 
to eliminate but really what we want to
do<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.099> from<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.520> just

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
do is then just go from there and just

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
do is then just go from there and just
do<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.059> best<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.200> just

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
do your best with what you have and just

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.959 
do your best with what you have and just
start<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.190> they're<00:00:35.340> doing<00:00:35.489> great<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
start to see if they're doing great and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.250 
start to see if they're doing great and
they're<00:00:36.059> totally<00:00:36.270> thriving<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.140> might

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
they're totally thriving then they might

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.450 
they're totally thriving then they might
not<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.440> an<00:00:37.710> issue<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> those

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
not have an issue with some of those

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100 
not have an issue with some of those
foods<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.090> brought<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.570> could<00:00:39.960> take

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
foods that we brought up I could take

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
foods that we brought up I could take
any<00:00:40.350> food<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.190> tell<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.670> why<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.000> bad<00:00:42.149> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
any food and tell you why it's bad you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
any food and tell you why it's bad you
could<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.780> greens<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.500> they're<00:00:43.680> bad

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
could take greens and they're bad

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
could take greens and they're bad
because<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.309> can't<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:44.910> oxalate

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
because you can't do them on an oxalate

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.950 
because you can't do them on an oxalate
diet<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.920> point<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.780> restrict<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
diet so the point is not to restrict you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.299 
diet so the point is not to restrict you
or<00:00:49.110> limit<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> give<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> plenty

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
or limit you but just to give you plenty

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
or limit you but just to give you plenty
of<00:00:50.430> knowledge<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.539> help<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
of knowledge so that you can help to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
of knowledge so that you can help to
determine<00:00:52.199> start<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> pinpoint<00:00:53.480> where<00:00:54.480> those

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
determine start to pinpoint where those

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
determine start to pinpoint where those
things<00:00:55.050> might<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.320> maybe<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.280> isn't<00:00:56.399> hidden

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
things might be maybe there isn't hidden

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
things might be maybe there isn't hidden
gluten<00:00:57.090> maybe<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:58.109> oxalate<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
gluten maybe it is an oxalate or a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
gluten maybe it is an oxalate or a
phenol<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.579> something<00:01:00.120> else<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.480> just

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
phenol or something else so we're just

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.910 
phenol or something else so we're just
giving<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> lots<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> information<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
giving you lots of information so you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770 
giving you lots of information so you
can<00:01:02.010> start<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> determine<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
can start to determine that some of that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.210 
can start to determine that some of that
for<00:01:03.989> yourself<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.040> just

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
for yourself and go from there so I just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
for yourself and go from there so I just
wanted<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> say<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.510> welcome<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
wanted to say that and then welcome to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.840 
wanted to say that and then welcome to
the<00:01:07.380> second<00:01:07.710> half<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> day<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> on

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the second half of the day which is on

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
the second half of the day which is on
the<00:01:08.970> specific<00:01:09.420> carbohydrate<00:01:09.689> diet<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the specific carbohydrate diet and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
the specific carbohydrate diet and
fermented<00:01:10.950> foods<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.640> fermented<00:01:12.060> foods

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
fermented foods the fermented foods

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
fermented foods the fermented foods
piece<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> most<00:01:14.100> part<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
piece is going to for the most part the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510 
piece is going to for the most part the
sed<00:01:15.150> compliant<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> GFC<00:01:16.680> F<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> will

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
sed compliant and GFC F so I will

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
sed compliant and GFC F so I will
mention<00:01:18.210> anytime<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.350> some

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
mention anytime that there are some

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
mention anytime that there are some
distinctions<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.479> wanted

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
distinctions that are not but we wanted
