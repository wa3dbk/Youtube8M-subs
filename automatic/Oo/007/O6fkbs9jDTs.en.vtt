beer<00:05:22.650> here<00:05:22.980> as<00:05:23.100> well<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.700> can<00:05:23.850> see<00:05:23.880> I've

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
beer here as well and you can see I've

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.680 
beer here as well and you can see I've
taken<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:25.680> do<00:05:26.580> like<00:05:26.760> a<00:05:26.790> shish<00:05:27.090> kebab<00:05:27.450> skewer

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
taken just do like a shish kebab skewer

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.320 
taken just do like a shish kebab skewer
and<00:05:28.170> I've<00:05:28.770> propped<00:05:29.130> up<00:05:29.400> his<00:05:29.610> back<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.240> his

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
and I've propped up his back and his

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.060 
and I've propped up his back and his
head<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:31.230> will<00:05:31.380> give<00:05:31.530> them<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> little<00:05:31.800> bit<00:05:32.040> of

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
head that will give them a little bit of

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.670 
head that will give them a little bit of
strength<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.300> then<00:05:33.510> that<00:05:33.690> helps<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.170> position

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
strength and then that helps to position

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.610 
strength and then that helps to position
if<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.700> want<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.120> tip<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.510> head<00:05:36.720> or<00:05:37.110> put

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
if you want it to tip the head or put

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.830 
if you want it to tip the head or put
any<00:05:37.770> sort<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.130> character<00:05:38.580> in<00:05:38.760> them<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.540> can<00:05:39.570> do

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
any sort of character in them you can do

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.170 
any sort of character in them you can do
that<00:05:39.870> while<00:05:40.170> he's<00:05:40.320> still<00:05:40.530> warm<00:05:40.800> once<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.550> the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
that while he's still warm once the the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.750 
that while he's still warm once the the
wok<00:05:42.480> starts<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.080> harden<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:44.310> bear<00:05:44.520> will

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
wok starts to harden the bear will

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.450 
wok starts to harden the bear will
become<00:05:45.120> solid<00:05:45.480> and<00:05:45.840> you<00:05:46.650> can't<00:05:46.890> change<00:05:46.980> the

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
become solid and you can't change the

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.050 
become solid and you can't change the
position<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:49.410> let's<00:05:49.440> just<00:05:49.950> let's<00:05:50.670> just<00:05:50.730> put<00:05:51.030> a

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
position so let's just let's just put a

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.940 
position so let's just let's just put a
little<00:05:51.120> bit<00:05:51.450> of<00:05:51.570> a<00:05:52.070> cute<00:05:53.070> little<00:05:53.220> tilt<00:05:53.640> on<00:05:53.850> him

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
little bit of a cute little tilt on him

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.110 
little bit of a cute little tilt on him
and<00:05:55.950> he'll<00:05:56.130> harden<00:05:56.490> lift<00:05:56.700> that<00:05:56.820> little

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
and he'll harden lift that little

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.230 
and he'll harden lift that little
critical<00:05:57.690> look<00:05:57.870> on<00:05:58.020> his<00:05:58.200> face<00:05:59.000> this<00:06:00.000> guy's

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
critical look on his face this guy's

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.450 
critical look on his face this guy's
been<00:06:00.450> hardening<00:06:00.870> for<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.140> little<00:06:01.350> bit<00:06:01.500> now<00:06:02.220> if

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
been hardening for a little bit now if

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.520 
been hardening for a little bit now if
your<00:06:02.670> wax<00:06:02.940> was<00:06:03.240> a<00:06:03.270> bit<00:06:03.480> on<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.840> cool<00:06:04.080> side

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
your wax was a bit on the cool side

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.410 
your wax was a bit on the cool side
you<00:06:05.130> might<00:06:05.310> find<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:05.790> when<00:06:06.060> you're<00:06:06.210> doing

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
you might find that when you're doing

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.810 
you might find that when you're doing
the<00:06:06.720> part<00:06:06.960> with<00:06:07.140> the<00:06:07.170> fork<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:08.670> you're

dandruff or your wax if end if you keep
going<00:06:13.470> too<00:06:13.680> much<00:06:15.770> you<00:06:16.770> will<00:06:16.860> end<00:06:17.070> up<00:06:17.190> with<00:06:17.250> like

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
going too much you will end up with like

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.750 
going too much you will end up with like
areas<00:06:18.060> where<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:19.380> fur<00:06:19.650> is<00:06:19.830> almost<00:06:20.160> white<00:06:20.460> and

kind of flaky or dandruff relooking then

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.170 
kind of flaky or dandruff relooking then
you've<00:06:24.560> overdone<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.950> fluffing<00:06:26.430> stage<00:06:26.850> and

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
you've overdone the fluffing stage and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.800 
you've overdone the fluffing stage and
to<00:06:27.720> fix<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.260> you<00:06:28.530> can<00:06:29.100> just<00:06:29.310> use<00:06:29.640> the<00:06:30.570> heat

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
to fix that you can just use the heat

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.850 
to fix that you can just use the heat
gun<00:06:31.080> on<00:06:31.260> low

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:43.210 

and<00:06:36.860> you<00:06:36.949> can<00:06:37.129> stay<00:06:37.310> here

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.580 

any<00:06:44.030> little<00:06:44.360> dandruff<00:06:44.840> you<00:06:44.870> may<00:06:45.140> have<00:06:45.320> and<00:06:45.530> you

any little dandruff you may have and you

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.380 
any little dandruff you may have and you
may<00:06:45.710> also<00:06:45.860> want<00:06:46.130> to<00:06:46.250> touch<00:06:46.460> up<00:06:46.490> the<00:06:46.730> nose<00:06:47.060> and

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
may also want to touch up the nose and

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.149 

but<00:07:00.419> you<00:07:00.569> can<00:07:00.719> ever<00:07:00.900> soften<00:07:01.499> the<00:07:01.620> bear<00:07:01.800> enough

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
but you can ever soften the bear enough

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.760 
but you can ever soften the bear enough
that<00:07:02.520> you'll<00:07:03.180> be<00:07:03.360> able<00:07:03.449> to<00:07:03.719> reposition<00:07:04.289> it<00:07:04.560> so

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
that you'll be able to reposition it so

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.679 
that you'll be able to reposition it so
that<00:07:04.949> is<00:07:05.129> basically<00:07:05.340> just<00:07:05.969> for<00:07:06.300> doing<00:07:06.449> a

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:06.689 
that is basically just for doing a

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.439 
that is basically just for doing a
little<00:07:06.870> bit<00:07:07.020> of<00:07:07.139> cleanup<00:07:07.409> and<00:07:08.060> also<00:07:09.060> that<00:07:09.300> is

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
little bit of cleanup and also that is

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.510 
little bit of cleanup and also that is
how<00:07:09.659> you<00:07:09.719> would<00:07:10.139> refresh<00:07:10.620> your<00:07:10.860> bear<00:07:11.039> if<00:07:11.249> it

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
how you would refresh your bear if it

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.100 
how you would refresh your bear if it
got<00:07:11.669> dusty<00:07:12.120> with<00:07:12.300> time
