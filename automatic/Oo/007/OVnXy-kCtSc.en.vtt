easy for example the poles are all the
same<00:06:05.849> height<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.330> conductors<00:06:06.870> of<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.110> right

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
same height the conductors of the right

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.189 
same height the conductors of the right
size<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:08.310> voltages<00:06:08.789> are<00:06:08.940> all<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.180> same<00:06:09.389> these

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
size the voltages are all the same these

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.450 
size the voltages are all the same these
communities<00:06:10.710> can<00:06:10.830> all<00:06:10.949> be<00:06:11.039> connected

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
communities can all be connected

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.700 
communities can all be connected
together<00:06:11.580> without<00:06:12.150> difficulty<00:06:15.379> so<00:06:16.379> how<00:06:16.650> do

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
together without difficulty so how do

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.010 
together without difficulty so how do
you<00:06:16.889> build<00:06:17.159> something<00:06:17.610> like<00:06:17.940> that<00:06:18.270> in<00:06:18.810> the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
you build something like that in the

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.010 
you build something like that in the
central<00:06:19.440> highlands<00:06:20.009> of<00:06:20.300> Afghanistan<00:06:21.300> I<00:06:21.629> mean

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
central highlands of Afghanistan I mean

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.689 
central highlands of Afghanistan I mean
I<00:06:22.080> know<00:06:22.229> it<00:06:22.440> looks<00:06:22.650> impressive<00:06:22.919> but<00:06:23.219> really

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
I know it looks impressive but really

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.369 
I know it looks impressive but really
it's<00:06:23.879> um<00:06:24.180> we<00:06:24.690> find<00:06:24.900> a<00:06:24.960> relatively

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
it's um we find a relatively

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.600 
it's um we find a relatively
straightforward<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:26.129> do<00:06:26.219> the<00:06:26.340> construction

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
straightforward to do the construction

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.200 
straightforward to do the construction
