00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.259 
we should do with Marx's f-150 and my my
idea<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.140> put<00:03:04.950> Martha's<00:03:05.459> cab<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:07.560> an<00:03:08.459> f-150

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
idea is to put Martha's cab on an f-150

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.289 
idea is to put Martha's cab on an f-150
that<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:11.430> an<00:03:11.609> extended<00:03:11.970> cab

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
that I have here it's an extended cab

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.059 
that I have here it's an extended cab
long<00:03:12.840> blocks<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.639> put<00:03:14.850> Marissa's<00:03:15.269> cab<00:03:15.569> on

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
long blocks so if I put Marissa's cab on

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:23.000 
long blocks so if I put Marissa's cab on
this<00:03:17.069> truck<00:03:18.829> which<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:20.040> regular<00:03:20.459> cab<00:03:22.010> you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
this truck which is a regular cab you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.400 
this truck which is a regular cab you
would<00:03:23.160> be<00:03:23.280> left<00:03:23.459> with<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.730> big<00:03:23.880> gap<00:03:24.239> between<00:03:25.109> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
would be left with a big gap between the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.819 
would be left with a big gap between the
box<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.690> cab<00:03:27.690> we've<00:03:28.170> talked<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.560> that

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
box and the cab we've talked about that

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:29.240 
box and the cab we've talked about that
before

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
before

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.670 
before
yeah<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.670> know<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.420> I'm<00:03:30.600> thinking<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.440> building

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
yeah I know so I'm thinking of building

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.190 
yeah I know so I'm thinking of building
like<00:03:32.609> cutting<00:03:32.940> his<00:03:33.150> blocks<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.780> making<00:03:34.079> like

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
like cutting his blocks and making like

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.220 
like cutting his blocks and making like
a<00:03:34.230> ten-foot<00:03:34.829> box<00:03:35.150> which<00:03:36.150> would<00:03:36.299> be<00:03:36.510> ideal<00:03:37.139> for

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
a ten-foot box which would be ideal for

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.229 
a ten-foot box which would be ideal for
scrapping<00:03:37.739> yeah<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> thing<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:39.030> put

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
scrapping yeah but the thing is it put

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.030 
scrapping yeah but the thing is it put
me<00:03:39.389> out<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.569> business<00:03:39.720> for<00:03:40.260> two<00:03:40.410> weeks<00:03:40.620> it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
me out of business for two weeks it

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.640 
me out of business for two weeks it
would<00:03:41.750> because<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:42.870> probably<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.380> while

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
would because that's probably a while

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.440 
would because that's probably a while
how<00:03:43.799> long<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.160> would<00:03:44.310> take<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:45.120> would<00:03:45.269> take

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
how long it would take to it would take

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.170 
how long it would take to it would take
two

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
two

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.589 
two
a<00:03:46.209> job<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.719> would<00:03:46.900> ruin<00:03:47.230> me<00:03:47.439> though<00:03:48.599> I'm

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
a job that would ruin me though I'm

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.179 
a job that would ruin me though I'm
thinking<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.049> just<00:03:50.200> changing<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> engine

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
thinking of just changing the engine

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.630 
thinking of just changing the engine
even<00:03:52.120> though<00:03:52.239> my<00:03:52.599> Ford<00:03:52.930> has<00:03:53.140> good<00:03:53.379> power<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
even though my Ford has good power the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.880 
even though my Ford has good power the
only<00:03:54.849> issue<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.810> oil<00:03:58.620> yep

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
only issue is the oil yep

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.420 
only issue is the oil yep
to<00:04:00.280> fix<00:04:00.489> your<00:04:00.609> oil<00:04:00.879> leak<00:04:01.120> you're<00:04:02.430> basically

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
to fix your oil leak you're basically

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.069 
to fix your oil leak you're basically
taking<00:04:03.639> your<00:04:03.819> engine<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.299> anyway<00:04:04.599> I<00:04:04.870> know

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
taking your engine out of anyway I know

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.539 
taking your engine out of anyway I know
that<00:04:05.409> so<00:04:05.620> if<00:04:05.650> you're<00:04:05.859> basically<00:04:06.189> taking<00:04:06.370> your

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
that so if you're basically taking your

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.220 
that so if you're basically taking your
engine<00:04:06.879> oh<00:04:06.969> you<00:04:07.239> might<00:04:07.389> as<00:04:07.540> well<00:04:07.569> pull<00:04:07.900> one<00:04:08.079> it

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
engine oh you might as well pull one it

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.879 
engine oh you might as well pull one it
that<00:04:08.920> has<00:04:09.069> he<00:04:09.219> needs<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.730> plumber<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.780> maybe<00:04:11.650> we

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
that has he needs a plumber so maybe we

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.759 
that has he needs a plumber so maybe we
should<00:04:11.920> let<00:04:12.219> it<00:04:12.250> go<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.609> full<00:04:12.819> vote<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
should let it go to a full vote the
