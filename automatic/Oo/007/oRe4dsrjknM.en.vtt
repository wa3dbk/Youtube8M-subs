00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello guys back there 17 3d 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 We want to show you the tests. 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.340
 initials of our new product there that is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 a cpu was based on images 7 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.850
 We only changed the provider 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.920
 We put it up to mega 128 4 that's for 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 have more personal memory space 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.980
 wanted to test some other movies 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.219
 many different 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.520
 We can put the test on cd. 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:38.280
 s of these things of difference 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 You also understand, have taken advantage of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.410
 people put usb would be a board 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 today here has a connector mini usb already 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.199
 have the converter on the board and already do all the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.149
 We work for people, we need people. 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 also removed the extracts 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.640
 by diego suites to make the selection 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:07.610
 here gives the steppe line the eighth in 16 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.360
 It's easier, we've changed. 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.490
 we have the entrances to the exits to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 from the stepper motors fan 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 or if we put protection too 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.479
 for the danger of something happening 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.820
 with stop and had not seen before 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.200
 put the protection not to run the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.509
 risk of burning the processor 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.590
 here we have input from sources of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.079
 output to roth the output to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.259
 the table that takes the exit enjoy the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.229
 controlled pwm we have two exits 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.690
 of an auxiliary fan here for us 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.480
 can use to cool drives 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.550
 but something you need on the board to 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.370
 people here have the stops 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.120
 oxy z 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:01.410
 the sensor is the rock band ntc and the sensor 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.640
 from the heated bed right there we rode 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.980
 here a setup we put say a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.070
 motor is that in each axis 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.640
 we put a fan here to stay 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.890
 turning right here at the auxiliary exit 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120
 here we have some character keys 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.790
 stops 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.960
 it is the fan that it is controlled by 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.140
 pwm and here we made a situation here 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.720
 to disguise the rating of the table and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.630
 put the lamps here to warm 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.770
 we arrived here also a servers together 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.100
 with the lamp we make a 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.960
 control simulation 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.560
 we turn on the system and went for a 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.040
 looked neither worked 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.950
 here we already have a led indicator of 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.209
 power supply 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.940
 Now you will connect to usb 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.840
 micro 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.370
 it has the LED that also indicates that it is 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.110
 connected 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 now we will do the communication 11 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.709
 repeat is already online chatted 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.850
 Now we can make an army. 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.200
 some things we see that the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.250
 auxiliary fan 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.660
 it is straight forward already running it is not then 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.890
 Now we'll work out some 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.300
 engines 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.300
 let's change the x-axis motor 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.550
 this goes on the one hand you can go back pro 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.680
 other 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.350
 We can take some bigger steps. 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.300
 also 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:45.330
 He's going to do it like that later, we have 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:48.260
 one and accurate 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.260
 then the z-axis 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.000
 the breath z beauty 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.000
 we have a story later 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.440
 was not a picture reached the jewel is the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.760
 The fan can be connected to the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.760
 pwn control 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.170
 is running on can decelerate a 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:33.320
 bit also put speed well 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:39.330
 low it will practically stop using 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:46.200
 To disconnect, we'll connect the part of the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:48.390
 heated table and hot and on the table this 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.910
 version we're using it does not 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.680
 have control prb on the table and repeat 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.170
 he is using have not yet and 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.520
 I have to lose on rating and India 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.240
 So we called him and got the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.530
 indicators at the table quickly arrived 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:08.070
 she starts to take control and the hot and 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:12.240
 is raising the temperature there in 70 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.370
 degrees in industry to be grade sakineh 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.310
 just to people here see the operating 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.120
 melt the plastic that the same industry 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.890
 to 70 degrees hawtin already starts to lose 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.770
 act because it is already arriving in 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:31.290
 temperature is very close to 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:37.350
 temperature it starts only keep the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:42.590
 making the temperature control to give 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.590
 a closer to ac 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:55.680
 there are the leds of the table that other that 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:59.910
 is blinking oled of the ratings that is 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.380
 making a control depends so have 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.840
 an important thing that we did 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.050
 we also have a cdc converter 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.330
 input to feed the card with 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.199
 5 volts and work all cold to people 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.419
 puts 12 volts works cold without 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.090
 bigger problems 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.240
 There is a reset button here. 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.520
 Connector in circles to make 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.919
 bootloader programming right 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.970
 only that the board will already be known as 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:33.530
 Buddha not to have bigger problems 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:37.220
 good for now is this personal thank you 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.220
 until the next
