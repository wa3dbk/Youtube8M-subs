00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.300 
and what I really loved about it was
just<00:00:25.050> being<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> world<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> doing<00:00:26.160> the

just being in the world and doing the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
just being in the world and doing the
crazy<00:00:26.960> maneuverability<00:00:27.960> stuff<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
crazy maneuverability stuff which is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
crazy maneuverability stuff which is
what<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> got<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> play<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.420> gave

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
what I got to play just now so they gave

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
what I got to play just now so they gave
me<00:00:30.750> access<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.590> bunch<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.920> missions<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.399> was

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
me access to a bunch of missions one was

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
me access to a bunch of missions one was
destruction<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.510> focused<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
destruction but I really focused in on

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.229 
destruction but I really focused in on
the<00:00:34.559> Winx<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> stuff<00:00:35.309> yeah<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> first

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the Winx in the stuff yeah so the first

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.819 
the Winx in the stuff yeah so the first
thing<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.570> did<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> gliding

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
thing they did was like a gliding

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.139 
thing they did was like a gliding
mission<00:00:38.190> where<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.879> hop<00:00:39.030> out

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
mission where they just you just hop out

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
mission where they just you just hop out
of<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.390> helicopter<00:00:39.660> he<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.559> lets<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> kind<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of a helicopter he just lets you kind of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
of a helicopter he just lets you kind of
glad<00:00:41.700> your<00:00:41.879> way<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.450> through<00:00:42.480> rings

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
glad your way down and go through rings

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.410 
glad your way down and go through rings
kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.469> nice<00:00:43.680> type<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.910> there's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
kind of like nice type thing but there's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
kind of like nice type thing but there's
a<00:00:45.480> lot<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> finesse<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> actual<00:00:46.559> movement

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
a lot of finesse to the actual movement

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.080 
a lot of finesse to the actual movement
which<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.219> felt<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.670> quite<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> bit<00:00:48.059> different

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
which we felt is quite a bit different

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.840 
which we felt is quite a bit different
from<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.780> previous<00:00:49.649> game<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.489> previous<00:00:50.610> game

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
from the previous game the previous game

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
from the previous game the previous game
was<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> lot<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.199> large

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
was a lot about just like really large

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
was a lot about just like really large
grapple<00:00:53.190> emotions<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.000> you've<00:00:54.149> grappled

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
grapple emotions like you've grappled

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
grapple emotions like you've grappled
onto<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.660> building<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.949> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
onto a building and then that was it you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.099 
onto a building and then that was it you
were<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.510> whereas<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
were just on your way there whereas this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
were just on your way there whereas this
has<00:00:58.230> got<00:00:58.379> loads<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.800> granular<00:00:59.250> grapple

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
has got loads of like granular grapple

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
has got loads of like granular grapple
points<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> ground<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
points like the ground and and like

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
points like the ground and and like
different<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.039> small<00:01:02.309> cars<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.030> kind

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
different like small cars and that kind

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.460 
different like small cars and that kind
of<00:01:03.239> stuff<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.539> give<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> boost<00:01:04.049> around

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
of stuff to give you a boost around

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
of stuff to give you a boost around
minded<00:01:04.799> me<00:01:04.920> quite<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> bit<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.460> Batman<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> way

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
minded me quite a bit of Batman the way

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.960 
minded me quite a bit of Batman the way
you'd<00:01:06.299> grapple<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.729> ledge<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you'd grapple up to like a ledge of a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
you'd grapple up to like a ledge of a
building<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.450> boost<00:01:10.049> over<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> was

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
building and boost over it so it was

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.679 
building and boost over it so it was
that<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.700> spent<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.000> bunch<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.450> time

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that and I just spent a bunch of time

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
that and I just spent a bunch of time
it's<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.290> Greg<00:01:13.619> gliding<00:01:14.040> around

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it's kind of like Greg gliding around

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.700 
it's kind of like Greg gliding around
and<00:01:14.700> seeing<00:01:15.119> how<00:01:15.299> maneuverable<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and seeing how maneuverable it was and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
and seeing how maneuverable it was and
it<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.860> surprisingly<00:01:17.400> maneuverable<00:01:17.939> between

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it was surprisingly maneuverable between

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
it was surprisingly maneuverable between
the<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.170> grapple<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.799> granular<00:01:20.280> grapple

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the kind of grapple the granular grapple

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
the kind of grapple the granular grapple
stuff<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.689> parachute<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> lot<00:01:22.799> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
stuff and the parachute you get a lot of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
stuff and the parachute you get a lot of
like<00:01:23.250> ability<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.720> around<00:01:24.900> buildings<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
like ability to get around buildings and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.560 
like ability to get around buildings and
underneath<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> obstacles<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.330> kind<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
underneath the obstacles and I kind of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
underneath the obstacles and I kind of
think<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:27.900> did<00:01:28.110> feel<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.890> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
think it really did feel a lot like that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
think it really did feel a lot like that
man<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> loved<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.869> actual

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
man and what I loved about it was actual

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.140 
man and what I loved about it was actual
the<00:01:32.040> way<00:01:32.159> they<00:01:32.310> take<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.729> things<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the way they take like things that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
the way they take like things that
should<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.540> bugs<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> turn<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.220> into<00:01:35.340> an

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
should be bugs and turn them into an

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.399 
should be bugs and turn them into an
actual<00:01:35.850> feature<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.229> moment

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
actual feature so there was this moment

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
actual feature so there was this moment
where<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.770> grapple<00:01:38.280> towards<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> mountain<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
where I grapple towards a mountain and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960 
where I grapple towards a mountain and
my<00:01:39.720> character<00:01:40.290> Rico<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> collided

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
my character Rico just kind of collided

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.580 
my character Rico just kind of collided
with<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> mountainside<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.810> down<00:01:43.259> stop

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
with the mountainside and down stop

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.670 
with the mountainside and down stop
which<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.310> probably<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.680> collision

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
which is probably like a collision

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
which is probably like a collision
glitch<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:47.460> he<00:01:47.520> goes<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> did<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
glitch where he goes all you did the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.810 
glitch where he goes all you did the
belly<00:01:48.600> bounce<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.680> come<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.610> guy

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
belly bounce and I was like come on guy

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
belly bounce and I was like come on guy
but<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.780> looked<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> seems

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
but then I looked at it and it seems

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
but then I looked at it and it seems
like<00:01:53.040> they've<00:01:53.549> done<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.509> unique

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
like they've done they put in unique

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
like they've done they put in unique
animations<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.040> stuff<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.820> when

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
animations for all this stuff so when

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.160 
animations for all this stuff so when
they<00:01:57.060> did<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> did<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> second<00:01:58.140> time

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
they did it when I did it a second time

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
they did it when I did it a second time
you<00:01:58.409> could<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.740> him<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> bouncing<00:01:59.670> surly

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
you could see him kind of bouncing surly

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
you could see him kind of bouncing surly
a<00:01:59.969> bit<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.689> he<00:02:00.869> does<00:02:01.020> things<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> backflips

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a bit and he does things like backflips

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.039 
a bit and he does things like backflips
I've<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> lot<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.299> contextual

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
I've got a lot of like contextual

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.680 
I've got a lot of like contextual
animation

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
animation

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.540 
animation
for<00:02:05.080> when<00:02:05.620> you're<00:02:05.740> approaching<00:02:05.980> certain

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
for when you're approaching certain

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.670 
for when you're approaching certain

like backflips and barrel rolls and that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.780 
like backflips and barrel rolls and that
kind<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.200> stuff<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.650> had<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> lot<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> lot<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.610> fun

kind of stuff I had a lot a lot of fun

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.490 
kind of stuff I had a lot a lot of fun
just<00:02:13.060> gliding<00:02:13.480> around<00:02:13.600> which<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.230> always<00:02:14.380> a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
just gliding around which is always a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.560 
just gliding around which is always a
mark<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:15.790> good<00:02:16.030> open<00:02:16.420> world

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
mark of like a really good open world

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.630 
mark of like a really good open world
experience<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.200> Batman<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.650> crackdown<00:02:18.370> and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
experience like Batman and crackdown and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.790 
experience like Batman and crackdown and
even<00:02:19.330> infamous<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.960> some<00:02:20.110> extent<00:02:20.470> but<00:02:20.650> it's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
even infamous to some extent but it's

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.620 
even infamous to some extent but it's
like<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.220> having<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> core<00:02:22.000> movement<00:02:22.450> stuff

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
like just having the core movement stuff

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.270 
like just having the core movement stuff
if<00:02:22.870> that's<00:02:23.080> good<00:02:23.290> enough<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.950> know<00:02:24.070> you're<00:02:24.220> in

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
if that's good enough you know you're in

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.560 
if that's good enough you know you're in
for<00:02:24.310> something<00:02:24.610> special<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.240> I'm<00:02:25.330> quite

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
for something special so I'm quite

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.640 
for something special so I'm quite
confident<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.200> game<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.380> going<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.560> be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
confident that this game is going to be

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.290 
confident that this game is going to be
called<00:02:26.830> yeah<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.370> wingsuit<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.820> lot<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.120> fun

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
called yeah the wingsuit is a lot of fun

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.180 
called yeah the wingsuit is a lot of fun
and<00:02:28.420> when<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> played<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.020> me<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.470> most

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
and when I played it for me the most

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.170 
and when I played it for me the most
interesting<00:02:30.370> thing<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.880> using<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
interesting thing was using the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.090 
interesting thing was using the
grappling<00:02:31.510> hooks<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.870> take<00:02:32.050> two<00:02:32.500> objects<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
grappling hooks you take two objects and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.290 
grappling hooks you take two objects and
smash<00:02:33.340> them<00:02:33.370> together<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.850> don't<00:02:34.060> know<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.240> you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
smash them together I don't know if you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.610 
smash them together I don't know if you
got<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.540> see<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.720> today<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.170> did<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.500> by

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
got to see that today I did it by

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.260 
got to see that today I did it by
accident<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.460> think<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.790> was<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.120> like

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
accident and I think it was just like

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.540 
accident and I think it was just like
two<00:02:37.450> barrels<00:02:37.960> yeah<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.620> was<00:02:38.830> going<00:02:39.100> towards

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
two barrels yeah and I was going towards

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.550 
two barrels yeah and I was going towards
them<00:02:39.700> at<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> same<00:02:40.060> time<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.780> blew<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.320> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
them at the same time so it blew up and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.620 
them at the same time so it blew up and
then<00:02:41.770> just<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.280> Californy<00:02:43.150> backwards

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
then just like to Californy backwards

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.780 
then just like to Californy backwards
which<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.260> unexpected<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.160> if<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.310> hold<00:02:45.550> it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
which is unexpected so if you hold it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.270 
which is unexpected so if you hold it
the<00:02:46.180> grapple<00:02:46.720> bond<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.380> will<00:02:47.650> attach<00:02:48.100> two

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the grapple bond it will attach two

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.520 
the grapple bond it will attach two
things<00:02:48.490> together<00:02:48.640> whereas<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.570> tap<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:50.050> it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
things together whereas if you tap it it
