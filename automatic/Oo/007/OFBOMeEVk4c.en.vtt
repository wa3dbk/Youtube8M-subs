00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
see that usually these guys are all

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.420

closed but you know it's cool this was
pretty<00:01:05.700> neat<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> saw<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> brain<00:01:07.140> coral

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
pretty neat when I saw the brain coral

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.700 
pretty neat when I saw the brain coral
this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> believe<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.470> when<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
this is what I believe it's when it's in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
this is what I believe it's when it's in
his<00:01:10.799> feeding<00:01:11.220> mode<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.700> i'm<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:11.909> mistaken

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
his feeding mode if i'm not mistaken

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
his feeding mode if i'm not mistaken
when<00:01:13.049> there's<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> tentacles<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
when there's all the tentacles up it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
when there's all the tentacles up it
almost<00:01:14.850> looks<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> torch<00:01:15.869> coral<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
almost looks like a torch coral from the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.300 
almost looks like a torch coral from the
tips<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:19.200> obviously<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
tips of it but obviously it's not and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
tips of it but obviously it's not and
this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.060> I've<00:01:21.240> seen<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.720> brain

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this is the first time I've seen a brain

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
this is the first time I've seen a brain
coral<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.860> I've<00:01:23.070> never<00:01:23.310> seen<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> like

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
coral like this I've never seen it like

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
coral like this I've never seen it like
this<00:01:23.850> maybe<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.020> does<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.380> night

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
