think what am I gonna do color is
fifteen<00:02:36.799> shades<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.340> these<00:02:37.489> different<00:02:38.299> totals

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
fifteen shades of these different totals

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.270 
fifteen shades of these different totals
so<00:02:39.019> if<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.349> don't<00:02:39.530> weren't<00:02:39.739> feeling<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.099> red
