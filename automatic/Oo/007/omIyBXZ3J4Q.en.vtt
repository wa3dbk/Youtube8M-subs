MLS<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> lot<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
MLS as you can see there's a lot of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.470 
MLS as you can see there's a lot of
players<00:00:29.369> I've<00:00:29.609> already<00:00:29.789> started<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> go<00:00:30.449> up

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
players I've already started to go up

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
players I've already started to go up
but<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.380> probably<00:00:31.560> pick<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
but you can probably pick up a lot of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
but you can probably pick up a lot of
them<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.700> quite<00:00:33.030> cheap<00:00:33.510> especially<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:34.320> they

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
them for quite cheap especially if they

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
them for quite cheap especially if they
bring<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:35.100> special<00:00:35.550> package<00:00:35.940> six<00:00:36.180> o'clock

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
bring out special package six o'clock

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.069 
bring out special package six o'clock
and<00:00:37.010> then<00:00:38.010> obviously<00:00:38.250> they'll<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> lot<00:00:39.899> easy

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

absolute<00:01:29.280> ton<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.579> coins<00:01:29.759> zara<00:01:30.479> des<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
absolute ton of coins zara des is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.690 
absolute ton of coins zara des is
probably<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> lot<00:01:32.009> just

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
probably going to go for a lot just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.789 
probably going to go for a lot just
because<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.329> his<00:01:33.810> man<00:01:34.020> he's<00:01:34.290> meant<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.680> like

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
because if his man he's meant to be like

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.289 
because if his man he's meant to be like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
absolutely sick and roll isn't all that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.679 
absolutely sick and roll isn't all that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
good jermain defoe be a good one because

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
good jermain defoe be a good one because
he's<00:01:42.960> obviously<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.409> really<00:01:43.770> good<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.100> 85

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

shooting or para she's going for a
hundred<00:01:48.149> K<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.590> probably

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
hundred K and but you could probably

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.590 
hundred K and but you could probably
pick<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> 59th

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
pick some of these up in like the 59th

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
pick some of these up in like the 59th
minute<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> fill<00:01:53.070> them<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.430> using

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
minute if you just fill them out using

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.850 
minute if you just fill them out using
the<00:01:53.880> concept<00:01:54.329> squad<00:01:54.540> method<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.710> guy

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the concept squad method and this guy

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.050 
the concept squad method and this guy
actually<00:01:55.979> looks<00:01:56.280> pretty<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually looks pretty good as for a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.219 
actually looks pretty good as for a
silver<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:59.210> Diaz<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.420> well<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.810> starts<00:02:01.079> kill

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
silver and Diaz is well for starts kill

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.620 
silver and Diaz is well for starts kill
for<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> silver<00:02:01.770> Oh<00:02:01.950> most<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> silvers<00:02:03.479> will

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
for a silver Oh most of the silvers will

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.889 
for a silver Oh most of the silvers will
probably<00:02:03.930> go<00:02:04.049> more<00:02:04.740> than<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.130> gold<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> if

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
probably go more than the gold and so if

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.210 
probably go more than the gold and so if
you're<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> build<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.590> team<00:02:07.770> build<00:02:08.129> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you're going to build a team build a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.089 
you're going to build a team build a
team<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:09.020> build<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.110> team<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.530> gold<00:02:10.800> players

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
team with build a team with gold players

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.850 
team with build a team with gold players
but<00:02:11.459> trade<00:02:12.000> with<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> silver

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
but trade with the silver

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.010 
but trade with the silver
so<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> silvers<00:02:13.370> are<00:02:13.460> going<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:14.750> tools

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
so the silvers are going to go the tools

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.660 
so the silvers are going to go the tools
are<00:02:15.140> going<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.470> up<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.650> price<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.010> most<00:02:16.220> and
