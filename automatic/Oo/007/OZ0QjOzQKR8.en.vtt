00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello friends now let's prepare a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.450
 series is preserved today I have a few 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.910
 shrimp or trumpets maria here already 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.220
 I have two cans made from another day is very 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 easy to do the truth 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.020
 that we take the tiny mushrooms 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 black pepper lauren a little bit of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 vinegar and water here I already have a mushroom 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.240
 recommended this morning as you can see 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.310
 These are bigger I'll leave you 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 I 'm going to dry it as I have here 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.780
 in the big tray for three 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.610
 days that are drying up and I'm going to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.270
 use the little ones like this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.239
 so it stays more cute and nothing and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 we will clean and separate them and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.090
 let boil 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.090
 here I already have separated 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.790
 especially because it is very difficult to 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.940
 clean as they are so tiny that 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.860
 we would put a pot with cold water and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.680
 let's open for a while 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.190
 we will take another pot with a liter of water 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.190
 cool 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.980
 the measurements are this is for a liter 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 a soup spoon of salt 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.220
 I have you are fat 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.050
 and three tablespoons of vinegar 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.010
 black pepper 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 I miss laurel 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.390
 have 3 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.549
 and today puts him in position 4 good and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.420
 we will put on fire 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.729
 here we have our boiling mushrooms 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.009
 As you can see, it starts to loose 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.390
 the foam we will have to remove all the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.950
 rest more and with the spoon 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.950
 It is very important to remove 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.450
 because if he does not then he keeps it 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.940
 it can explode and we're going to take everything 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.920
 until it is well cleaned here a 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.770
 as long as you can see the broth 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.520
 it makes cleaner now what we're going to 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.450
 to do is find a colander 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.380
 to remove water and agree with cold water 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.380
 let's be good with cold water 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.390
 we come back to find the pot 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.890
 we throw our broth that we have done 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.230
 before 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.769
 with salt aurelina greece is hot 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.760
 and we will put on a slow fire about 20 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.879
 minutes more or less 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 we already have the mushrooms dates apart not 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.390
 we will put the boats for you 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.390
 sterilize 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.780
 well we have everything done the pot well 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.580
 sterilized and we will find the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.160
 logical mushrooms the spoon calculate if it is 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.800
 that there is an appointment outside do not put it 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.390
 in the tin 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.960
 because if not it will not be but we're going to 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.620
 compare here together with the laurel and 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.620
 Pepper 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.820

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.820
 five the lid 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.640

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.840
 says to our mushrooms in the can 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.870

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.020
 chopped onion and take a little 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.390
 olive oil 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.810
