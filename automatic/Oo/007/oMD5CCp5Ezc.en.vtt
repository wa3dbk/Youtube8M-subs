00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.050
 hi i'm simonetta today i want you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 tell how to prepare a good one 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.170
 compost which is nothing but a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 natural soil conditioner obtained from 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 kitchen and garden waste 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.230
 first of all we must possess one 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 compost bin that does not necessarily have to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.919
 be the plastic one you buy 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.200
 normally in specialized shops 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.540
 we can also do it with four poles of 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.600
 wood bordering a square e 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.700
 moderate it with a net at this point 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.560
 we must put our ingredients 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.079
 we should get a good one 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.870
 balancing of fresh items that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.520
 they are the carbon or the elements 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.520
 buckets that are nitrogenous in the kitchen 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.130
 always keep the scraps as skins of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.130
 apple potatoes salad leftovers 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.240
 you can also add if you are 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.159
 lucky of wood ash 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 I recommend that it be wood 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:17.930
 chimney mowing the grass to do 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.930
 a better compost you can also use 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.539
 we can also use the shells of the 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.729
 new finely chopped like I did 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.770
 I am a fanatic of the good 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.700
 composting I like to get a 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:43.860
 more crushed soil and therefore it 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.209
 I pass the dry element to the chopper 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.619
 I always keep some from the autumn 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:54.789
 Dry leaves 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:59.470
 esm in use also we can also 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.899
 add tea filters or even 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.039
 those of coffee the important and 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.590
 then mix everything for good 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:12.280
 let's leave them for six to nine months depends 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.500
 where the compost bin is kept and from 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.720
 time especially in the summer will be more 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.790
 accelerated the process in the winter will be 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.599
 a little bit longer and we'll get a good one 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.790
 compost rich in nutrients 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.060
 if there are still coarse parts 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.690
 we can get help from a sieve 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.400
 like this you find on sale too 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.780
 in stores that sell equipment 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.780
 Constructions 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.569
 sift finely and the parts more 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.010
 put it back in the coarse compost 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.560
 maturale again at this point is 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 ready your scented compost like 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.470
 forest land 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.890
 your plants will thank you good 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.890
 garden
