00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.660
 the ak 12 comes from russian 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.350
 production and is based on the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.420
 proven front with timo fitch 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.700
 kalashnikov developed ak serie 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 the ak is here in the assault rifle 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.629
 categories and stands with it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.290
 of course, the stoos data available 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.820
 This rifle has a firing rate of 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.739
 650 shot in the minute and arrange 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.800
 so rather in the lower segment of the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.710
 storm rifles in terms of cadence 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.600
 a magazine jaka almost here the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.839
 standard 30 balls in Russian 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.839
 caliber 5.45 x 49 mm 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.700
 around the thirty cool ones of the magazine too 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.370
 to be able to bring to the man 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.590
 the ak 12 about the single shot of the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.440
 Of course, just a bullet fired 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.260
 a threesome with activity 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.450
 fired three shots as well, of course 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.880
 the fully automatic mode of which balls 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.470
 spits until the magazine is empty 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.110
 Reload speed was 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.420
 not the closed second could 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 along with the three available fire 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.710
 modes, the ak 12 is grouped in the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.460
 assault rifle sector in this area in the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 mittelfeld a 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.020
 as the next important factor we have 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.930
 the recall control is the recoil 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.000
 Control of ak 12 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.250
 in the raw state speak without any 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.530
 torchance and counter-control fired 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.539
 The Ak 12 makes a noise picture 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.990
 strong up with additional 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.610
 slight distortion left by the whole 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.250
 we have to counteract that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.380
 mouse now set so easy 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.720
 move it down to the right 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.850
 close picture closer together and hold 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.780
 so that the weapon corresponding exactly time 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.489
 to be able to give 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 You can shoot in one 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.239
 corresponding smaller radius 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:20.450
 which, of course, will place a faster one 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:22.819
 Dying of the opponent causes what the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.370
 the ak 12 mg starts to damage this 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.680
 at 25 points to a distance 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.610
 of eight meters and then falls in 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.799
 a damage area from 24 9 to 18 1 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.410
 score per hit from which on 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.569
 a distance of 55 meters at one 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.700
 constant damage of 18 damage 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.829
 scored points and from this value 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.359
 no longer basically sinks 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.310
 be aware that this is about 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.900
 hurt some fundamental concerns which 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.700
 through appropriate multipliers 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.200
 due to different hit zones 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 course may differ 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.560
 the ak 12 offers a solid all around 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.420
 package with which you mainly on 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.610
 mean distance due to the burst 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.020
 Mode and a reasonable fire rate 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.120
 good what can tear 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.100
 in the monastery segments except this 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.750
 but rather with a different weapon 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.340
 everything in the carbine segment better 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.810
 operated and also a bit bigger 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.850
 distance you should open 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.930
 reason of the drop in damage your ammunition 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.560
 he save on and situation or 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.320
 use distance-dependent 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.530
 In this sense, keep your goals in the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.530
 eye
