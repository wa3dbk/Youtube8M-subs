getting<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.840> day<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.070> Cavaliers<00:00:41.280> they're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
definitely thinking about storm starting

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.860

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
fresh and rebuilding and I think they

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319 
fresh and rebuilding and I think they
have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.379> brand<00:00:49.739> future<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
have a brand future but right now the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
have a brand future but right now the
Cavaliers<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> good<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.280> team

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
Cavaliers are not that good of a team

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880
