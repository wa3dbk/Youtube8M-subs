00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.289
 but on the other we continue in the municipality of tegueste of music of the school 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.750
 workshop since this one to talk about a very special project 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.679
 they will think every month at headquarters for nothing because otherwise they are capable of 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.259
 degrade garbage 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.909
 il transform the fertilizer in his speech speaks in the first instance 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909
 and the technology 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.730
 the new entity we are currently in tegueste 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.920
 it's all a school workshop 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.380
 percent and for those who do not know what a sentence is 10% 1 project 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.660
 formative that last acts year 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.300
 in this one the particular this school is dedicated 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.130
 towards what the value of the rural therefore there are two very specialties 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.130
 important are gardening and landscape restoration 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.810
 i the herrera gastronomy 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.130
 the first has 18 working students 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.900
 in the second 14 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.800
 his age is between 16 and 24 years 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 I was originally the job seeker 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.410
 We are currently loyal to the queen in the eighth month of operation 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.430
 They have already passed training 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.860
 iniesta m right now because it has a very important part of practices in the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.250
 sector we are doing expanding our training 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.470
 percent the basic training has been the ideals of gardening 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.370
 and we are going to spend gardeners oil installed in the country as well 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.240
 but all that is framed in the economic part 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.930
 that in this particular case today we are going to give a vermiculture course that 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 complementary training to the law 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 or give a talk about vermiculture vermiculture 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.350
 the background those practices related to worm hazard 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.319
 in order to produce high quality organic fertilizers 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.950
 or to be able to generate a source of protein for feeding 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.399
 animals such as chickens 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:21.469
 that with respect to vermiculture we use a worm that is 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.809
 presents here in the Canary Islands of the Insa century 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:26.670
 formality 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.610
 It is part of the modern zone of the Canary Islands and it is 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.949
 often called the red worm of california 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.029
 although in truth they are scientific men poetic licenses 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:42.389
 There are men who are the same as on the surface of the ground. 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.870
 they are very voracious with the organic remains then not only what 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:46.789
 we make see 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.099
 intensify the amount of earthworms in smaller spaces so we achieve 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.469
 she transworld transform fools rest jordan ikoko her products 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.059
 derived from agriculture livestock in high fertilizers 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.969
 quality 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.379
 and one of the applications that he also has the humus producer of 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.019
 earthworm compound balloon is the making of this text 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.219
 p is multiply that yes we already have a large concentration of microorganisms 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.079
 export multiply for the purpose will be foliar applications 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:19.939
 against to fight against it was burned as a phytosanitary to fight against 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.299
 as little defensible a flight and gave in vineyard 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.249
 With all three, what we want to do is multiply the 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.249
 microorganisms that we already have meek in the genome of man 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.019
 as the microorganism does not have legs we use water to be a means 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.109
 from which she can be found 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.419
 silly microorganisms measure in the presence of air then multiply them 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.349
 what do we do 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.349
 with an aeration pump we inject haydee per hundred 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.720
 in this dilution 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.290
 and also percent and we introduce nutrients that can be in the case 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.559
 of milk hello honey 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.809
 On the one hand the annie laporta 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.949
 minerals such as boron magnesium and milk provides fat 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.699
 i the most suitable mine series of elements that do not work 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.559
 on the other hand in the end and the multiplication of the organism can 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:08.640
 you told me 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.070
 saints with these products we can feed and multiply the 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.999
 population we do not leave airing 24 hours at 24 hours 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:20.949
 we have that we suspend the aeration three or four hours to apply it 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.999
 we must said that these microorganisms nene presence of air then film 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:29.069
 let us suspend the aeration and a long time ago they end up dying 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.799
 these microorganisms on the surface of the leaf do the same and 

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:36.379
 the same thing that happens in our human skin ajalvir malaspina de 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.999
 beneficial microorganisms that are defending us against attacks from 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.509
 other pathogens that could not get sick 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.629
 so we do with the surface of the leaves of the villa 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.699
 in this case you can also apply in dad pulti are not attacked by 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.699
 men and honeycomb 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.900
 currently, as we received in the same municipality, many of them were already 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.849
 we knew from a tribune 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:10.689
 1 year 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.800
 and we have noticed that both 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.860
 very involved in it 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.689
 a blow of agriculture has managed to wake up 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.020
 a series of values 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.699
 what the seeing that they are fundamental fra sound 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.699
 a spokesman for the labor market will be ready 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.249
 hernandez 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.050
 restlessness to learn all of type d 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.500
 of systems such as vermiculture have accepted willingly
