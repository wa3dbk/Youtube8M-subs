you<00:02:08.050> do<00:02:08.259> anything<00:02:08.709> take<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.160> out<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.689> then

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
you do anything take this out and then

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.369 
you do anything take this out and then
slowly<00:02:11.290> fill<00:02:11.920> by<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:13.299> colon<00:02:13.750> tank<00:02:14.019> over<00:02:14.349> here

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
slowly fill by the colon tank over here

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.480 
slowly fill by the colon tank over here
and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.100 
and
you<00:02:15.640> can<00:02:15.820> see<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.330> water<00:02:16.510> coming<00:02:16.870> out<00:02:17.050> of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
you can see some water coming out of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.190 
you can see some water coming out of
here<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.210> going<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> start<00:02:19.780> up<00:02:19.990> let

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
here then you just going to start up let

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
here then you just going to start up let
it<00:02:20.290> run<00:02:20.500> let<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.890> heat<00:02:21.100> up<00:02:21.690> let<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> car<00:02:22.990> cool

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
it run let it heat up let the car cool

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.590 
it run let it heat up let the car cool
down<00:02:23.500> again<00:02:23.680> check<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.310> level<00:02:24.820> top<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.300> up<00:02:25.420> as

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
down again check the level top it up as

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.250 
down again check the level top it up as
necessary<00:02:26.790> some<00:02:27.790> people<00:02:28.090> wonder<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:29.050> goes

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
necessary some people wonder what goes

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.220 
necessary some people wonder what goes
wrong<00:02:29.500> with<00:02:29.680> these<00:02:30.510> common<00:02:31.510> thing<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.870> they

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
wrong with these common thing is they

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.890 
wrong with these common thing is they
stick<00:02:32.620> open<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:34.000> don't<00:02:34.420> have<00:02:34.660> any

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
stick open and you don't have any

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.220 
stick open and you don't have any
temperature<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> engine<00:02:36.840> once<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.990> while

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
temperature in the engine once a while

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.210 
temperature in the engine once a while
they'll<00:02:38.680> stick<00:02:39.220> close<00:02:39.610> that's<00:02:40.120> not<00:02:40.360> too<00:02:40.600> often

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
they'll stick close that's not too often

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.350 
they'll stick close that's not too often
sometimes<00:02:42.220> they<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.460> air<00:02:42.670> bound<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.180> will

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
sometimes they get air bound that will

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.820 
sometimes they get air bound that will
be<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.660> got<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> leak<00:02:44.080> someplace<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.740> the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
be if you got a leak someplace in the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.100 
be if you got a leak someplace in the
system<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.610> little<00:02:45.820> air<00:02:45.910> got<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.300> there<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.900> if

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
system and little air got in there so if

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.660 
system and little air got in there so if
you<00:02:47.230> fill<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:47.680> bleed<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.130> air<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.310> you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you fill it up bleed the air out you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.870 
you fill it up bleed the air out you
should<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.880> fine<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:51.160> about<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.640> with<00:02:51.670> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
should be fine that's about it with the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.580 
should be fine that's about it with the
