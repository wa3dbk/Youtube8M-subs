00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.439

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.470
 to upload to youtube as you have already seen 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.079
 in the title of the video I have to tell you 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.079
 that my channel many do not know my 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.610
 channel is created since 2006 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.170

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.050
 jealous but that my channel is created 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.360
 since 2006 and of course it was a channel 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.400
 who believes because before youtube for nothing 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 it was like it is now youtube the people 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.890
 he created his channels to upload things 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.770
 what they did because then youtube 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.250
 I did not pay you money for uploading videos was 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.670
 a very, very different thing 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.920
 so I was 15 years old at that time 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.400
 years had I think I remember when I did 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 the channel and made videos with friends 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.930
 but videos that we saw the others then 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 our computers because I did not have 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.430
 idea that there was YouTube until the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.080
 day I discovered youtube and I said I'm going 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.799
 my friends I'll upload here 3 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.689
 in three chapters of a series of 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.780
 cartoons I made with my friends 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.629
 they are made by the country super crappy and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.569

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.379

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 I went up to youtube is one the drawings 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.450

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.189

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.989
 of time and uploading all so that what 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.440
 you see I had to delete these videos 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.879
 when I started uploading games videos and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.139
 others a couple of years ago I had them 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.450
 eliminate because apart from that they gave me 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.829
 I was very afraid of copyright 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.510
 I had no idea what the subject of 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.159
 copyright that I was afraid to have these 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.069
 admitted videos then I discovered that 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.549
 It was not as much as I imagined and 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.139

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.090
