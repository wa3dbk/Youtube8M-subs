00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:40.309 
sure not to catch on to the other
section<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.000> there's<00:03:18.180> no<00:03:18.389> tangling

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.550 

then<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.349> coil<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.129> ends<00:03:42.689> so<00:03:43.689> it<00:03:43.840> locks<00:03:44.019> nicely

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.130 
then I coil the ends so it locks nicely
and<00:03:44.769> has<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> really<00:03:45.549> defined<00:03:45.670> curl<00:03:46.120> up<00:03:46.239> in<00:03:46.450> take

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
and has a really defined curl up in take

00:03:47.140 --> 00:04:08.550 
and has a really defined curl up in take
a<00:03:47.170> look<00:03:47.379> again<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.780> that's<00:04:07.930> how<00:04:08.140> your<00:04:08.319> twist

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560
