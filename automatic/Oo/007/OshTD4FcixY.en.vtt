00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the I guess 5 years is what you would

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.069 
the I guess 5 years is what you would
call<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.000> five<00:00:45.239> years<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
call it in five years which is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
call it in five years which is
