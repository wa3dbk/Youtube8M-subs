00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.460
 emulators for ios android I already made the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 Android version work here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089

 with a simpler part as I told you 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.650
 it's much simpler than what we have 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.500
 what to do on the web because if you have to 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.970

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.800
