00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:12.270
 b item 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:23.050
 Here is a negative zero positive g 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:27.160
 Two first course of today's theme Te is about Holding the temperature 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.220
 It is called Ellie position before or before hitting the ball 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.010
 This Lenny position is common to all shots except strokes and volleys. 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.500
 I am ready for 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.890
 Remember by all means 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.980
 First of all, the foot is below the shoulder width 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.110
 I bend my knee a little 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:55.420
 Weight should be slightly on your toes 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:59.060
 Masu great deal before only the top from the upper body waist in this state 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.460
 Support to make a fist behind the waist 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.980
 Back 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.980
 Keep it straight and chest tight 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.530
 It is already state gargery position 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.070
 I will be with you a little bit of knee spread feet to about shoulder width 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.600
 From a slightly bent foot 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.950
 Only rest from the waist 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.550
 my time 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.000
 Kelp shorts planned behind 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:32.540
 And to straighten the back 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.540
 Heart depression becomes a little point 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.980
 This status etc. by position 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.640
 At first 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.820
 Such a thing 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 Because I feel a little 993 around the waist 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.060
 When you wear it first, it will be reflected in battle comfort 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 Next is how to hold the racket at this time, but based on the jacket roughly 45 degrees with both hands 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.640
 is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:12.190
 At this time I think that it is better if you go through the racket or at the same height as your own eyes 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.980
 By doing so, you can catch Goa- san or backhand quickly. 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.319
 I will 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:26.079
 Let's relax and do our best so that extra power does not enter 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.230
 I think I can not do it at first, but before Orlowe always take that Rayleigh position 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.230
 let's do it
