like<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> mini<00:00:40.170> version<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
like as the mini version and then this

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.380

benzene I'm not quite sure how to say
let's<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> honest<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> base<00:01:59.250> gives<00:01:59.549> like

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
let's be honest but the base gives like

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270 
let's be honest but the base gives like
the<00:01:59.880> scent<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.390> warm<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.009> smelt

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the scent of warm that can be smelt

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.649 
the scent of warm that can be smelt
throughout<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.700> hold<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> fragrance<00:02:03.570> so

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
throughout the hold the fragrance so

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.780 
throughout the hold the fragrance so
it's<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> sweet<00:02:04.409> amber<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.009> benzoin

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it's like the sweet amber and benzoin

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.109 
it's like the sweet amber and benzoin
zone<00:02:06.500> what<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.950> given<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> scent<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
zone what has given the scent like the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.800 
zone what has given the scent like the
cream<00:02:09.420> warm<00:02:10.160> edged<00:02:11.160> kinder<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.239> set

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
cream warm edged kinder to the set

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.900 
cream warm edged kinder to the set
and<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:14.130> overall<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.740> starts<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:16.800> us<00:02:17.160> we

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and so overall this starts with us we

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.720 
and so overall this starts with us we
like<00:02:18.569> citrus<00:02:19.140> birds<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.709> pink<00:02:19.980> pepper<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
like citrus birds with pink pepper and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.090 
like citrus birds with pink pepper and
creamy<00:02:21.180> floral<00:02:21.630> middle<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.620> warm<00:02:22.890> yet

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
creamy floral middle and a warm yet

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.580 
creamy floral middle and a warm yet
gourmand<00:02:23.520> based<00:02:23.880> whip<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:25.020> scent<00:02:25.290> has

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
gourmand based whip so this scent has

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.860 
gourmand based whip so this scent has
been<00:02:25.920> described<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.550> love<00:02:26.850> or<00:02:27.060> hate<00:02:27.420> sort<00:02:27.810> of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
been described as a love or hate sort of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.260 
been described as a love or hate sort of
fragrance<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:30.060> it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
fragrance and I think it's because it's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.580 
fragrance and I think it's because it's
quite<00:02:30.480> different<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.260> average

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
quite different to your average

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.790 
quite different to your average
celebrity<00:02:32.430> fragrance<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.600> more<00:02:33.900> subtle<00:02:34.290> for

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
celebrity fragrance it's more subtle for

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.340 
celebrity fragrance it's more subtle for
older<00:02:35.370> mature<00:02:35.550> wearers<00:02:36.390> rather<00:02:36.810> than<00:02:37.080> like

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
older mature wearers rather than like

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.080 
older mature wearers rather than like
the<00:02:37.680> young<00:02:37.920> people<00:02:38.340> who<00:02:38.489> are<00:02:38.520> used<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.910> like

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the young people who are used to like

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.590 
the young people who are used to like
sweet<00:02:39.750> vanilla<00:02:40.050> fruity<00:02:40.770> floral<00:02:41.160> fragrance

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
sweet vanilla fruity floral fragrance

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.960 
sweet vanilla fruity floral fragrance
but<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:44.340> quite<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> nice

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
but I do think it is a it's quite a nice

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.880 
but I do think it is a it's quite a nice
fragrance<00:02:45.269> especially<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.230> nighttime<00:02:46.709> as
