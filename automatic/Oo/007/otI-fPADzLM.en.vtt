space 3d and today we're going to be
looking<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.620> navigation<00:00:14.160> side<00:00:14.730> t5

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
looking at navigation side t5

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.810 
looking at navigation side t5
specifically<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.890> new<00:00:17.099> edit<00:00:17.400> camera

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
specifically the new edit camera

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.940 
specifically the new edit camera
function<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:19.020> i'm<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> open<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.710> scene

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
function so i'm going to open up a scene

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.890 
function so i'm going to open up a scene
i've<00:00:20.099> got<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.610> so<00:00:21.599> we've<00:00:21.750> got<00:00:21.869> our

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
i've got here so we've got our

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170 
i've got here so we've got our
traditional<00:00:22.619> methods<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> navigation<00:00:24.029> which

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
traditional methods of navigation which

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.970 
traditional methods of navigation which
is<00:00:24.360> our<00:00:25.400> dragon<00:00:26.480> pull<00:00:27.480> method<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.200> as<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.800> just

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
is our dragon pull method so as we just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.819 
is our dragon pull method so as we just
show<00:00:29.250> everything<00:00:29.520> here<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.930> so<00:00:31.590> just

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
show everything here there we go so just

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.670 
show everything here there we go so just
pull<00:00:32.310> and<00:00:32.460> push<00:00:32.899> drag<00:00:33.899> left<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.500> right

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
pull and push drag left and right

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.130 
pull and push drag left and right
everyone<00:00:35.010> rotate<00:00:35.489> we've<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:36.510> our<00:00:36.630> elevation

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
everyone rotate we've got our elevation

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
everyone rotate we've got our elevation
modes<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> elevate<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:38.970> camera

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
modes here so to elevate the camera

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.650 
modes here so to elevate the camera
controller<00:00:40.079> pitch<00:00:40.380> double<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.449> we've<00:00:42.449> got

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
controller pitch double down we've got

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.540 
controller pitch double down we've got
the<00:00:42.780> spin<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.590> spins<00:00:43.890> us<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.309> circle<00:00:44.809> ok

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
the spin which spins us in a circle ok

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.419 
the spin which spins us in a circle ok
we<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.670> pan<00:00:48.089> which<00:00:48.679> allows<00:00:49.679> us<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:49.980> pan<00:00:50.190> up

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
we have pan which allows us to pan up

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.989 
we have pan which allows us to pan up
and<00:00:50.730> down<00:00:50.910> left<00:00:51.269> or<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.160> phase<00:00:53.670> two

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
and down left or right we have phase two

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.689 
and down left or right we have phase two
which<00:00:54.179> is<00:00:54.210> quite<00:00:54.539> useful<00:00:55.070> basically<00:00:56.070> phase<00:00:56.339> 2

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
which is quite useful basically phase 2

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
which is quite useful basically phase 2
allows<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> orientate<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> camera

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
allows you to orientate the camera

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
allows you to orientate the camera
automatically<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.519> any<00:00:59.699> surface<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.269> click

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
automatically to any surface you click

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.829 
automatically to any surface you click
on<00:01:00.989> using<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> phase<00:01:01.649> 2<00:01:01.949> function<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.690> is

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
on using the phase 2 function so this is

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.110 
on using the phase 2 function so this is
quite<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> nice<00:01:04.589> quick<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.370> get<00:01:05.640> around<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
quite a nice quick way to get around the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.860 
quite a nice quick way to get around the
room<00:01:06.560> ok<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.300> we<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.690> want

room ok but on to the one we really want

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.289 
room ok but on to the one we really want
to<00:01:09.960> focus<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.650> which<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> edit<00:01:11.610> camera<00:01:13.009> ok

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
to focus on which is edit camera ok

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
to focus on which is edit camera ok
what's<00:01:15.299> nice<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.509> edit<00:01:16.049> cameras<00:01:16.439> it

what's nice about edit cameras it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
what's nice about edit cameras it
provides<00:01:16.890> us<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.549> plan<00:01:18.360> view

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
provides us with a little plan view

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.620 
provides us with a little plan view
window<00:01:19.079> of<00:01:19.680> our<00:01:19.860> room<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.180> two<00:01:21.390> little

view ok can move it anywhere in the room
and<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:39.000> choose<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.299> view<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and it would choose that view you do the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
and it would choose that view you do the
same<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.579> target<00:01:42.090> point<00:01:42.350> we've<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.560> anywhere

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
same for target point we've got anywhere

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
same for target point we've got anywhere
in<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.039> room<00:01:44.219> now<00:01:44.939> camera<00:01:45.390> will

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
in the room now camera will

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.550 
in the room now camera will
automatically<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.829> target<00:01:47.070> point

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
automatically look at that target point

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.959 
automatically look at that target point
we've<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:49.860> other<00:01:50.039> additional<00:01:50.579> options

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
we've got some other additional options

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.480 
we've got some other additional options
here<00:01:51.270> such<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.469> focus<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.270> controls<00:01:54.659> our

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
here such as focus this controls our

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
here such as focus this controls our
dental<00:01:56.490> field<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.119> example<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.859> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
dental field for example if we make this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.139 
dental field for example if we make this
12<00:01:59.460> press<00:02:00.450> Enter<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.609> that<00:02:02.909> lens

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
12 press Enter you can see how that lens

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.120 
12 press Enter you can see how that lens
really<00:02:03.659> distorts<00:02:04.109> our<00:02:04.229> image<00:02:04.640> go<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> 45

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
really distorts our image go up to 45

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.460 
really distorts our image go up to 45
very<00:02:08.130> close<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.759> ok<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.690> our<00:02:09.869> default<00:02:10.289> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
very close in ok so our default is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.809 
very close in ok so our default is
always<00:02:10.710> 22

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
always 22

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.750 
always 22
we<00:02:12.719> can<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.049> things<00:02:13.290> I've<00:02:13.560> change<00:02:13.890> our<00:02:14.249> camera

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
we can do things I've change our camera

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.789 
we can do things I've change our camera
heights<00:02:14.999> I<00:02:15.269> could<00:02:15.480> make<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.749> 1.8<00:02:16.319> meters<00:02:16.620> for

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
heights I could make that 1.8 meters for
