someone's like a three point on the
tracker<00:00:27.160> currently<00:00:27.970> we<00:00:28.119> have<00:00:28.240> six<00:00:28.510> implements

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
tracker currently we have six implements

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.570 
tracker currently we have six implements
well<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.500> first<00:00:29.710> one<00:00:29.859> that<00:00:29.980> we<00:00:30.070> designed<00:00:30.369> was

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
well the first one that we designed was

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.460 
well the first one that we designed was
the<00:00:30.670> aerator<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.420> aerator<00:00:31.720> has<00:00:31.960> three<00:00:32.290> inch

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
the aerator the aerator has three inch

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.490 
the aerator the aerator has three inch
spikes<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:33.640> are<00:00:33.730> welded<00:00:33.940> on<00:00:34.210> that<00:00:34.930> as<00:00:35.230> you're

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
spikes that are welded on that as you're

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.140 
spikes that are welded on that as you're
rolling<00:00:35.680> across<00:00:36.160> your<00:00:36.400> property<00:00:36.610> your<00:00:36.970> lawn

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
rolling across your property your lawn

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.090 
rolling across your property your lawn
in<00:00:37.390> your<00:00:37.420> field<00:00:37.750> if<00:00:38.050> you<00:00:38.260> creates<00:00:38.620> holes

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
in your field if you creates holes

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.310 
in your field if you creates holes
within<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:40.059> sod<00:00:40.269> that<00:00:40.300> allow<00:00:40.809> for<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.110> water

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
within the sod that allow for the water

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.319 
within the sod that allow for the water
seep<00:00:41.830> in<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.129> you<00:00:42.280> get<00:00:42.430> just<00:00:42.460> better<00:00:42.879> coverage

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
seep in and you get just better coverage

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.209 
seep in and you get just better coverage
after<00:00:43.780> progression<00:00:44.559> after<00:00:44.710> we<00:00:44.980> have<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
after progression after we have the

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.950 
after progression after we have the
aerator<00:00:45.550> was<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.940> roller<00:00:46.120> basically<00:00:46.809> it's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
aerator was the roller basically it's

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.720 
aerator was the roller basically it's
the<00:00:47.079> same<00:00:47.260> same<00:00:47.739> implement<00:00:48.309> without<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
the same same implement without the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.150 
the same same implement without the
spikes<00:00:49.000> but<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.840> creates<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.530> smooth<00:00:50.770> surface

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
spikes but it creates a smooth surface

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.950 
spikes but it creates a smooth surface

that's in your lawn golf course would be

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.720 
that's in your lawn golf course would be
a<00:02:35.019> great<00:02:35.290> place<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.590> use<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.920> thing<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
a great place to use the thing so the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.830 
a great place to use the thing so the
Harrow<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.060> actually<00:02:37.390> one<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.570> our<00:02:37.720> most

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
Harrow is actually one of our most

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.229 
Harrow is actually one of our most
unique<00:02:38.100> implements<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.580> Harrow<00:02:39.790> is

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
unique implements I think the Harrow is

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.150 
unique implements I think the Harrow is
designed<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.140> such<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.320> way<00:02:41.440> that's<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.980> top

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
designed in such a way that's the top

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.250 
designed in such a way that's the top
frame<00:02:42.519> of<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.970> flip<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.330> over<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.049> one

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
frame of it you flip it over so in one

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.199 
frame of it you flip it over so in one
direction<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.769> have<00:02:44.890> spikes<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.090> are

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
direction you have spikes that are

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.940 
direction you have spikes that are
sticking<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.630> about<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.959> half<00:02:47.019> inch<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.739> for

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
sticking down about a half inch so for

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.740 
sticking down about a half inch so for
like<00:02:48.070> horse<00:02:48.400> arena<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:48.970> force<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.630> can

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
like horse arena or force and you can

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.930 
like horse arena or force and you can
get<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:50.080> nice<00:02:50.320> finished<00:02:50.769> look<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.790> hair

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
get a really nice finished look the hair

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820 
get a really nice finished look the hair
over<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:52.720> got<00:02:52.870> spikes<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.380> dig<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.709> an
