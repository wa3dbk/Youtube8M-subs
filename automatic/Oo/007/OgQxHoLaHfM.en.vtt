been<00:01:02.879> kept<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.629> number<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.019> shotgun<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.650> it's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
been kept as number one shotgun and it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
been kept as number one shotgun and it's
pretty<00:01:04.979> much<00:01:05.100> Ashley<00:01:05.489> phono<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.560> pvp

which is quite annoying at times but
that's<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.960> complete<00:01:10.320> alternative<00:01:10.830> to

just<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> shotgun<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.790> does

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
just now but that shotgun really does

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.200 
just now but that shotgun really does
bring<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> best<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.630> people<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
bring out the best in people and the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
bring out the best in people and the
main<00:01:36.450> reason<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.810> weapon<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.860> damn

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
main reason that weapon is just so damn

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
main reason that weapon is just so damn
good<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.540> barrels<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.990> have

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
good is because the barrels that I have

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
good is because the barrels that I have
on<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.590> cure<00:01:41.520> eyes<00:01:41.610> ballistics<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.360> few<00:01:42.570> choke

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on a cure eyes ballistics and few choke

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
on a cure eyes ballistics and few choke
either<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.350> these<00:01:43.470> increases<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
either one of these increases to the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160 
either one of these increases to the
range<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.509> range<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.020> thing

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
range of it and range is the one thing

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.139 
range of it and range is the one thing
you<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> shotgun<00:01:47.149> because

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you really want for a shotgun because

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.230 
you really want for a shotgun because
the<00:01:48.390> main<00:01:48.540> pack<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:48.869> range<00:01:49.229> finder<00:01:49.619> which

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
the main pack has range finder which

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.550 
the main pack has range finder which
damn<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.079> brought<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.530> a

shotgun if you've got range finder or

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
shotgun if you've got range finder or

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
short package one of the two and really

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.850 
short package one of the two and really
really<00:01:56.729> make<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> difference<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.860> damaged

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
really make a difference a damaged

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.730 
really make a difference a damaged

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
upgrading well it's only skilled at 276

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
upgrading well it's only skilled at 276
best<00:02:02.610> thing<00:02:02.790> still<00:02:03.000> destroying<00:02:03.329> cristobal<00:02:03.840> as

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
best thing still destroying cristobal as

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.569 
best thing still destroying cristobal as
long<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.320> iron<00:02:04.560> banner<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.520> don't

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
long as it's not iron banner but i don't

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
long as it's not iron banner but i don't
actually<00:02:05.759> tried<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> n<00:02:06.240> iron<00:02:06.479> bearing<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
actually tried to n iron bearing it so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
actually tried to n iron bearing it so
it<00:02:07.110> could<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:07.829> good<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.280> then

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it could be really really good and then

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.999 
it could be really really good and then
the<00:02:09.420> handle<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.929> perak<00:02:10.200> saw<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the handle the perak saw you see that

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.260 
the handle the perak saw you see that
that<00:02:11.250> puts<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> little<00:02:11.910> better<00:02:12.030> range

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that puts up that a little better range

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.820 
that puts up that a little better range
can<00:02:12.870> also<00:02:12.959> compact

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
can also compact

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.340 
can also compact
on<00:02:13.890> high<00:02:14.070> caliber<00:02:14.430> round<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.780> hand<00:02:16.170> Lord

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
on high caliber round but the hand Lord

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.860 
on high caliber round but the hand Lord
really<00:02:16.800> really<00:02:17.120> not<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.450> painting<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> lot

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
really really not like painting a lot

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.500 
really really not like painting a lot
about<00:02:18.960> range<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.410> see<00:02:19.530> they're<00:02:19.710> actually

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
about range you see they're actually

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.820 
about range you see they're actually
equates<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.600> quite<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> bit<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.530> copy

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
equates to quite a bit so you can copy

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.740 
equates to quite a bit so you can copy
from<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> unify<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.640> range<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.600> why<00:02:24.720> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
from I unify the range that's why I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.090 
from I unify the range that's why I
think<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.050> does<00:02:25.200> actually<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.650> taste<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
think it does actually can taste the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.030 
think it does actually can taste the
fair<00:02:26.250> winners<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.410> I'm<00:02:28.410> not<00:02:28.560> too<00:02:28.710> sure<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
fair winners and I'm not too sure you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560 
fair winners and I'm not too sure you
can<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.340> probably<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.790> better<00:02:29.970> rule<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
can get probably a better rule on the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.630 
can get probably a better rule on the
fair<00:02:30.750> winners<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.800> range<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.520> as

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
fair winners but the range is just as

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.790 
fair winners but the range is just as
high<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.210> blue<00:02:33.420> shotgun<00:02:33.900> something

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800
