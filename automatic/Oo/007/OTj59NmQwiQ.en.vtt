00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 most popular category of running 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.290
 Shoe this of course workhorses the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.200
 There are sneakers in which we can 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.840
 matte mileage such sneakers 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.660
 should protect our legs as much as possible 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.029
 at the same time give the opportunity to run 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.369
 at a fairly wide range of speeds 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 the wider is the range of speeds 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.750
 Of course it was better not killed 1080 35 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.539
 It belongs to this category 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.219
 the sneakers are hardy sturdy and reliable and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.520
 and very versatile 1085 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.510
 from not balance in 5 it means 5 options 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.160
 This model is categorized as 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 neutral cushion sneakers then 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.360
 there is no lateral support in them 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.160
 but at the same time quite a lot is invested 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.320
 in 1080 for stable performance nagaina 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.320
 support that is to stabilize the sneakers 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 for depreciation in 1085 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.860
 meet the three technology-fifth of it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:14.810
 and un-231 and nitrogen and be promises very 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 long service life and and without reduction 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.600
 the damping qualities of us are very parts 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 another variant 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.530
 and from it and a rubber article with increased 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.680
 elastic characteristics for better 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.100
 repulsion well and in the middle sole 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.439
 integrated material 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 review is a unique material new 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.820
 balance which compensates the shock 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.810
 load without recoil but precisely recoil 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.680
 and overloads 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 and our legs Khibin stabilizing 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.189
 elements of 1085 are quite powerful and good 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.200
 keeps leg no twists no 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.119
 other movements of the feet on the support are not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.360
 felt for more and stability in 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.819
 1080 is also an asymmetrical heel 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.250
 designed so pretty tricky 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.670
 in a way 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.600
 but the main feature of the sole 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.380
 and 1085 from my point of view it is exactly 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.940
 insert and you birst in the juicy part 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:30.670
 in a compartment with a cellular structure it is this 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.160
 gives almost a record 1085 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.630
 stability for this category 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:44.750
 sneakers Dagh very well kept 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:50.739
 even on uneven surfaces the grid has 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:54.560
 1080 to 5 is not the most breathable but very 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:00.260
 strong and very many fortifications 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:07.060
 1080 round heel perimeter 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.450
 in 5 8 millimeters a little on her feet 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.790
 1085 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.160
 feels like pretty flat sneakers 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:22.160
 here the 885 is quite wide and 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.280
 there is plenty of space for both lifting and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.130
 toes 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.739
 I'm still hidden features and in his tongue 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.780
 stretch the bottom part to me this 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.650
 seemed quite convenient for accurate 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.970
 fit 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.110
 long and fast running shoes 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:46.510
 weighs 10 85 307 grams of these sneakers 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.750
 completely different depreciation concept 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.440
 different from most 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.590
 amateur runners they amortize 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.440
 shock load without recoil meaning you 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.230
 barely feel hit 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.500
 but you feel the surface very 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.519
 tight foot setting to this 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.239
 need to get used to 1085 you can run 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.239
 a lot on any surfaces while on 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.720
 very wide speed range 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.709
 thanks to a unique combination 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.709
 depreciation and stability 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.570
 oriented 1085 on runners with 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.590
 neutral foot setting but i'm still 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.290
 I can advise 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 them and runners with posing legs on 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.160
 outer part 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.120
 that is , a pronator hippo though basic 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.050
 running shoes 1085 can choose 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.420
 runners from 65 to 90 even up to a hundred 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.520
 kilograms there is another sphere 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.280
 application 1085 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.740
 this is a hopping job thanks 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.050
 unique combination of depreciation and 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.490
 stability and this is almost 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.160
 zero return 1085 much lower 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.480
 trauma and when performing large 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:13.100
 the volume of these very necessary but very 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.100
 traumatic workouts
