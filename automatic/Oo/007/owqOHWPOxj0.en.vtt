in exercise number one I'm wearing a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.319 
in exercise number one I'm wearing a
thumb<00:00:37.079> pick<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> two<00:00:38.280> finger<00:00:38.670> picks<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.180> on

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
thumb pick and two finger picks one on

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
thumb pick and two finger picks one on
the<00:00:39.420> index<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> middle<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.890> all

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the index one on the middle and all

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
the index one on the middle and all
we're<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> simply<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.199> using<00:00:44.040> our

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
we're going to simply do is using our

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.060 
we're going to simply do is using our
thumb<00:00:44.540> alternate<00:00:45.540> between<00:00:45.690> strings<00:00:46.320> six<00:00:46.769> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
thumb alternate between strings six and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.930 
thumb alternate between strings six and
four<00:00:51.079> now<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.650> many<00:00:52.920> techniques<00:00:53.250> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
four now there are many techniques that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.360 
four now there are many techniques that
finger<00:00:54.600> pick<00:00:54.809> rulers<00:00:55.140> will<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
finger pick rulers will use to kind of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.630 
finger pick rulers will use to kind of
stabilize<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.809> arm<00:00:58.190> for<00:00:59.190> instance<00:00:59.220> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
stabilize the right arm for instance you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
stabilize the right arm for instance you
could<00:00:59.820> allow<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.230> upper<00:01:01.230> arm<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.530> rest<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
could allow the upper arm to rest on the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.999 
could allow the upper arm to rest on the
edge<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> guitar<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.289> this<00:01:04.470> heel

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
edge of the guitar you can use this heel

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.920 
edge of the guitar you can use this heel
area<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.640> hand<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.149> rested<00:01:06.690> on<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
area of your hand and rested on the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
area of your hand and rested on the
bridge<00:01:07.289> as<00:01:07.590> long<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.160> mute<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bridge as long as it doesn't mute the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.120 
bridge as long as it doesn't mute the
strings<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.720> also<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.200> use<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.470> pinky

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
strings and you also can use your pinky

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
strings and you also can use your pinky
to<00:01:11.520> touch<00:01:11.759> on<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> soundboard<00:01:12.539> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.229> use

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to touch on the soundboard you can use

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
to touch on the soundboard you can use
all<00:01:13.560> three<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.009> these<00:01:14.130> techniques<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.119> any

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
all three of these techniques or any

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.930 
all three of these techniques or any
combination<00:01:15.810> whatever<00:01:16.470> kind<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.830> works<00:01:17.250> for

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
combination whatever kind of works for

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.529 
combination whatever kind of works for
you<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.149> feel<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> stable<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.399> to<00:01:21.330> get

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
you to feel kind of stable now to get

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.139 
you to feel kind of stable now to get
this<00:01:21.800> sounding<00:01:22.800> good<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.789> really<00:01:23.910> want

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
this sounding good what you really want

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.880 
this sounding good what you really want
to<00:01:24.210> work<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.539> is<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.720> timing<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.590> want<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to work on is the timing you want the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
to work on is the timing you want the
timing<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.910> nice<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.479> consistent<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
timing to be nice and consistent and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.230 
timing to be nice and consistent and
steady

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.970 

and<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> want<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> stroke<00:01:34.230> to<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.710> very

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
and you want the stroke to be very

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.160 
and you want the stroke to be very
strong<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.670> accurate<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:42.300> just<00:01:42.930> practice

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
strong and accurate and just practice

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.900 
strong and accurate and just practice
this<00:01:43.590> over<00:01:43.980> and<00:01:44.130> over<00:01:44.250> again<00:01:44.460> until<00:01:44.760> it

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
this over and over again until it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.820 
this over and over again until it
becomes<00:01:45.030> very<00:01:45.390> natural<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.230> it<00:01:46.380> feels<00:01:46.620> like

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
becomes very natural and it feels like

00:01:46.830 --> 00:02:01.110 
becomes very natural and it feels like
your<00:01:47.010> thumb<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.580> automatic<00:01:48.210> pilot

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.130 
and exercise number two all I'm doing is
playing<00:02:05.290> string<00:02:05.860> one<00:02:06.130> while<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:06.790> alternate<00:02:07.690> my

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
playing string one while I alternate my

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.300 
playing string one while I alternate my
index<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.830> middle<00:02:08.890> finger<00:02:13.800> see<00:02:14.800> again<00:02:15.100> you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
index and middle finger see again you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.250 
index and middle finger see again you
want<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.580> get<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.820> nice<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.060> consistent<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
want to get it nice and consistent and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.920 
want to get it nice and consistent and
steady<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.040> strong<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.060> clean

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.839 

Oh

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.809 

in<00:02:32.170> exercise<00:02:33.170> number<00:02:33.650> three<00:02:34.159> we're<00:02:34.640> going<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
in exercise number three we're going to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.640 
in exercise number three we're going to
be<00:02:34.909> playing<00:02:35.150> two<00:02:35.420> lines<00:02:35.719> of<00:02:35.930> music<00:02:36.079> at<00:02:36.469> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
be playing two lines of music at the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
be playing two lines of music at the
same<00:02:36.920> time<00:02:37.280> using<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.909> pinching<00:02:38.420> method

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
same time using a pinching method

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.660 
same time using a pinching method
although<00:02:39.620> it's<00:02:39.799> not<00:02:40.010> going<00:02:40.189> to<00:02:40.249> sound<00:02:40.430> that

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
although it's not going to sound that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.479 
although it's not going to sound that
interesting<00:02:41.389> maybe<00:02:42.049> because<00:02:42.590> we're<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
interesting maybe because we're going to

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.129 
interesting maybe because we're going to
be<00:02:43.549> playing<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.030> bass<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.450> treble<00:02:44.510> notes<00:02:44.959> at

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
be playing the bass and treble notes at

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.949 
be playing the bass and treble notes at
the<00:02:45.290> same<00:02:45.499> time<00:02:45.799> as<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.099> unison<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.689> what<00:02:47.870> I'm

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the same time as a unison so what I'm

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.539 
the same time as a unison so what I'm
going<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.139> do<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:48.680> somebody's<00:02:49.069> my<00:02:49.189> thumb<00:02:49.519> on

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
going to do is somebody's my thumb on

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.240 
going to do is somebody's my thumb on
string<00:02:50.060> six<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.750> my<00:02:51.200> middle<00:02:51.469> finger<00:02:52.040> on

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
string six and my middle finger on

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.699 
string six and my middle finger on
string<00:02:52.609> one<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.269> pinch<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.139> two<00:02:54.319> strings<00:02:54.590> at

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
string one and pinch the two strings at

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.610 
string one and pinch the two strings at
the<00:02:54.739> same<00:02:54.829> time<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:57.049> thumb<00:02:57.290> will<00:02:57.409> come

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
the same time then my thumb will come

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.289 
the same time then my thumb will come
down<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.099> fourth<00:02:58.370> string<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.879> I'll<00:02:59.090> play

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
down to the fourth string and I'll play

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.619 
down to the fourth string and I'll play
the<00:02:59.450> first<00:02:59.480> string<00:03:00.109> with<00:03:00.349> my<00:03:00.799> index<00:03:01.219> finger<00:03:01.629> so

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
the first string with my index finger so

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:11.050 
the first string with my index finger so
like<00:03:02.810> this

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.270 

so<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.390> thumb<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.900> alternated<00:03:13.530> between<00:03:13.560> six

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
so the thumb is alternated between six

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.270 
so the thumb is alternated between six
and<00:03:14.549> four<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.900> first<00:03:16.319> string<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.680> being

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and four and the first string is being

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.140 
and four and the first string is being
played<00:03:17.599> by<00:03:18.599> an<00:03:18.750> alternation<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.760> your<00:03:20.760> index

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
played by an alternation of your index

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.600 
played by an alternation of your index
in<00:03:21.299> your<00:03:21.390> middle<00:03:21.540> finger

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.830 

you

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.440 

and<00:03:34.040> exercise<00:03:35.040> number<00:03:35.550> four<00:03:35.700> we're<00:03:36.269> going<00:03:36.390> to

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
and exercise number four we're going to

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.390 
and exercise number four we're going to
play<00:03:36.599> two<00:03:36.629> lines<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.379> music<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:38.220> we're<00:03:38.310> going

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
play two lines of music but we're going

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.690 
play two lines of music but we're going
to<00:03:38.459> use<00:03:38.519> an<00:03:38.760> alternating<00:03:39.480> method<00:03:40.019> where

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
to use an alternating method where

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.580 
to use an alternating method where
string<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.420> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> fall<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.200> between

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
string one is going to fall in between

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.300 
string one is going to fall in between
the<00:03:44.190> base<00:03:44.400> notes<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> pattern

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
the base notes so this is the pattern

00:03:46.310 --> 00:04:07.990 
the base notes so this is the pattern
six<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:48.300> four<00:03:49.910> six<00:03:50.910> one<00:03:51.269> four<00:03:51.890> one

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.960 

and<00:04:08.260> exercise<00:04:09.260> number<00:04:09.740> five<00:04:10.160> you're<00:04:10.760> going<00:04:10.910> to

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
and exercise number five you're going to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.580 
and exercise number five you're going to
practice<00:04:11.180> switching<00:04:11.990> between<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.560> two

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
practice switching between the two

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.750 
practice switching between the two
methods<00:04:13.190> from<00:04:13.900> unison<00:04:14.900> pinching<00:04:15.470> and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
methods from unison pinching and

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.760 
methods from unison pinching and
alternating
