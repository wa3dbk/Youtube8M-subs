00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
strings Dada

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
strings Dada
it's<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> regular<00:01:21.030> dot<00:01:21.420> inlays<00:01:21.600> sort<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's not the regular dot inlays sort of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
it's not the regular dot inlays sort of
like<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> Jeff<00:01:23.280> Loomis<00:01:23.600> c7<00:01:24.600> Hellraiser

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
like the Jeff Loomis c7 Hellraiser

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.020 
like the Jeff Loomis c7 Hellraiser
inlays<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:26.070> similar<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.939> same<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
inlays very similar but not the same and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
inlays very similar but not the same and
it's<00:01:30.110> free<00:01:31.110> free<00:01:31.770> way<00:01:32.030> tone<00:01:33.030> switch<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it's free free way tone switch and the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
it's free free way tone switch and the
scale<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> body<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.240> twenty<00:01:36.509> six<00:01:36.720> point

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
scale of the body is twenty six point

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.580 
scale of the body is twenty six point
five<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> metal<00:01:38.729> beast<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.590> really

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
five so it is a metal beast it's really

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
five so it is a metal beast it's really
a<00:01:40.619> piece<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.009> work

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
a piece of work

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.800 
a piece of work
chrome<00:01:42.479> black<00:01:42.720> hardware<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.570> can<00:01:45.570> either<00:01:45.689> be

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
chrome black hardware and can either be

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
chrome black hardware and can either be
bought<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.380> walnut<00:01:46.829> Saturn<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.970> pure

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
bought in walnut Saturn or just pure

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.330 
bought in walnut Saturn or just pure
black<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> chose<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> black<00:01:49.920> model

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
black so I chose the black model

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.840 
black so I chose the black model
obviously<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.250> good<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> body

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
obviously and it's good because the body

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.090 
obviously and it's good because the body
is<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.030> similar<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> ibanez<00:01:55.170> RG<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.799> vs

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
is very similar to the ibanez RG or vs

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.179 
is very similar to the ibanez RG or vs
series<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.479> it'll<00:01:57.869> fit<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.290> most<00:01:58.469> cases<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
series so it'll fit in most cases you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
series so it'll fit in most cases you
don't<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> molded<00:02:00.450> case

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
don't really have to get a molded case

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.230 
don't really have to get a molded case
and<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.799> will<00:02:01.890> save<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and it will save you a lot of time and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
and it will save you a lot of time and
money<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:05.329> it<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.360> available<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> left

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
money and it is available in the left
