00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.899
 insidious I already have peace throughout 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.460
 when you want to stop spinning anymore 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.630
 throughout the race or what the hell is going on 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 Uncle is and all I go wrong I 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.490
 the somersault yaiza san luis for 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.619
 all the pop sites we jump around here 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.220
 now I 'm sure I 'll stay in a cactus or 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.009
 something like that is incredible but good 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.380
 moment I put myself third guys I have 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.630
 these two here that are the first ones 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.789
 let's see if I can come back quickly 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.560
 since they are not too far away either 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.610
 that is our helper but good I have 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.930
 here to this one 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.250
 that welcomes me the slipstream to see 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.520
 as the ramp well pop there is 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.990
 and let's go down we straighten my mother 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.860
 I knew it 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.470
 You see, you know, it's like you have all the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.540
 highway and there is only one murito a 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.010
 burrito that occupies very little space 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.740
 I have to fall right against the wall or 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.690
 be and eat it but full is that it is 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.880
 awesome we entered the back to 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.380
 the guys we go there already I have to 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.090
 ask how the jumps really are 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.640
 they are the key or that someone takes badly 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.160
 a jump and I went ahead to see it and go 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.860
 let's quickly fall down and 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.840
 there it is, do not jump boy if you call me 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.970
 they are so and point and my mother the time 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.620
 that I had left but good today is 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.970
 the moment of riding something was going fifth already 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.440
 I'm going third is jumping around here it's worth 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.900
 besides in fact I have the second one here 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.360
 with me that is the minimum error there 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.610
 I'm going to be 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.170
 and I say around here we get inside 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.590
 everything you can to trim everything 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.769
 the possible time 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.360
 and this one I'm going to go out a lot 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.670
 ok with the words mother of mine you take 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.599
 time cuts yes sir and we call it 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.910
 and now here we will see little 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.910
 happens has started the whole point just wrong 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.720
 I almost missed the damn point, my mother 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.769
 OK 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.400
 to see if ccoo put it right to the first 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.129
 so since they are narrow, it seems that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.120
 no but but you have to catch it and high 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.890
 speed in three clear 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.959
 it has been worth it veered left off 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.000
 out there is mine, it did not go out like that 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.849

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.530

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.870
 is the first one is or is this is the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.709
 First 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.000
 let's go down damn it and it's worth 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.519
 worth it because these guys and they 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.549
 I have here I go with the first one we go 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.019
 I have to put myself first like me 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.420
 good kid at least today has 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.610
 cut a post and I have to the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.750
 first, if I'm not wrong before, it was 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.640
 the one who went first the one who left 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.000
 out because this is the one that had everything 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.269
 hang out with me all that is 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.709
 Wait, wait, wait for a kid and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.630
 I almost fall again in the same place 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.610
 which is impressive but good to see 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.669
 for the time guys I show myself third 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.900
 and we are going to finish the second round 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.510
