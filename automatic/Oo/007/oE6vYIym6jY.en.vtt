00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 all today I will introduce you 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.569
 the various modifications made 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 new strict psp then for all 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.340
 first turn off and we will show you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 where is the button al but it is 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.369
 found below now instead 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.080
 on the side on the sky after wearing 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.740
 to put the helmet always stands 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.160
 below as before here and there after the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 memory stick 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 it's safer here, but here at 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 above the device 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.250
 there is more there is more than one 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.739
 the slaps and otherwise you can get 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.629
 ask why a listen that 99 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.760
 euros instead of 100 9 compared to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.390
 the old is simply because 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.150
 that there is no internet 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 there is no local network where there is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.740
 we can not play we can play 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 some games 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 we can not play in a network 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.130
 with the game sharks after if not after 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.460
 there is everything so there are extra parameters 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.540
 for videos for comics to put 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.520
 the photos and to install a device 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.990
 photo for music for movies 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 and for the game of course after if not the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 there here then there is the touch 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.890
 chain pestis so when we're in a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.979
 game and click on it makes us 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.009
 leave game yes or no it's my dad 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.710
 but in front of their label rest of battery 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.460
 and 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.619
 then the next there are the buttons 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:10.899
 + and - volume so we'll see it 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:12.940
 so wait after there is no longer the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.840
 big screen button that there was before 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.510
 here and the touch with the little music 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.390
 I saw that it is not and there is always 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.540
 the select and start key and there it was 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.000
 buttons on the old lala is there 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.790
 and now we think it's a bit 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.470
 a touchpad spell and no it takes 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.940
 press in and it works 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.209
 that's after it looks like a bit of a 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:49.600
 behind while bp that only one 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:53.380
 case instead of the case is 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.680
 together instead of all that two all 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.640
 the back of the psp and opens to 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.670
 places before it's always a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.160
 100 volt battery 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.190
 the loader is on the other hand twice 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.180
 smaller and we will be ready the usb port 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.440
 is in ruins the port to put there 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.070
 the camera is still there the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.920
 touch r1 and r2 land to his country to his 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.810
 offers more transparent and well I hope 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.730

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.360
