00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone celte would have 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.519
 new presentation of two modes on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.089
 is found for the presentation of the mode 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 a hood and no items this game the 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.680
 present once in a way in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.510
 my top 5 minecraft modes that I 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.189
 invite you to go see who is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.779
 available on the channel simply 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.660
 I talked about it so it's a mode that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 lets you see all the kraft while 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 like the kraft mode guide I did 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.420
 the presentation but this one is when 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.809
 even much better because he did not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.680
 need to have little books for 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.680
 present the cra 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.500
 let's just go back two short seconds 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 kraft guide who is precisely the other 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.140
 graph mode 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.000
 you can also see the kraft 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.730
 without the book using kraft lead 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 but the basis of the mode is very small 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.050
 book for bad cracks and this one 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.680
 just lets you see the kraft 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:08.760
 directly with your interface with 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.390
 your interface as with too many 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 times 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 so for example I want to see the craft 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250
 of the TNI I press it it will put 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.180
 the craf of the tnt simply 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.180
 after if for example I have a kraft 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.609
 just expected me that I spend 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.009
 will show you right after that 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:36.060
 it's so for example I have the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.429
 distributor here if I do I press 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.119
 on air with the mouse on the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.950
 distributor 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.479
 it will put the craft of the distributor 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.679
 after I can press to see the craf 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 of the bow et cetera and so on 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.500
 so you have the 'utility' mode that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 lets you see the kraft 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.380
 directly by pressing on and without 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.099
 cheat 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.599
 like I have you without cheating so like 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.009
 I showed it a few seconds ago 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.530
 and you also have the mode 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.509
 the schip mode that allows you to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.000
 your fears of giving you all that 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.819
 you want and after you can 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.630
 use etc etc 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.640
 you also have the trick for 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.860
 delete at the end of finding the cubes more 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 early when you're in fashion chic this is 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.049
 like too many theme this simply 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 after you have the luthier who rides the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.319
 risk mode saas and I do not know how 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 can I explain it to you 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.730
 but you can see the kraft but 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.190
 how can i help you 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 explain that like that I 'm not 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:47.050
 had a cheat here if I put it all 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.770
 on the ground I have more on one for the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:56.470
 for the other thing so now I'm going 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:58.120
 in russia mode the reef mode i do not know 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.830
 more what it is my mouse just from me 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.980
 let go in full video is there more than 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.980
 Battery 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.550
 she is dry my game playing with the pad 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.510
 it is not very serious 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.960
 so that's just the way it's 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.390
 so you have utilities mode and the 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.030
 ipsos match and useful elements 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.850
 little russia I have never used at 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.800
 your hairdresser but the most interesting 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.480
 it's still the 'utility' mode for 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.710
 to be able to see the graphs of everything and 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 whatever 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.930
 it's also possible with them with 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.110
 the notes you install know where 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.820
 put the kraft also ba ba voila 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.520
 it's the presentation is already finished 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.010
 it's the note and nape mode items it's 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.410
 this simply generates 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.410
 I have a superb English pronunciation 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.870

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.380

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.140
