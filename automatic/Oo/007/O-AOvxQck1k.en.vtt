then put the nail into the frame so when

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.490 
then put the nail into the frame so when
you're<00:02:21.060> doing<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.480> other<00:02:21.630> side<00:02:21.930> make<00:02:22.290> sure

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you do it this way so put the chain over

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.770 
you do it this way so put the chain over
the<00:02:25.280> marking<00:02:26.280> first<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.880> then<00:02:27.120> put<00:02:27.390> your<00:02:27.630> nail
