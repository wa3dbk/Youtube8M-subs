00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.720
 Hello 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.420
 Today I will explain to you how I did it. 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.310
 this pool for dolls using 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.560
 many materials I already had at home 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.400
 children who wish to perform these 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.249
 home 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.109
 I recommend that you ask for help from parents or 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:25.949
 of a responsible adult in the use of 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.949
 of dangerous objects ok then let's go 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.440
 I used a box of plastic fruit 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.770
 What did you have at home? 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 I cut the lid I painted this box 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.170
 fruit inside only in the part of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.170
 inside with blue acrylic paint 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:59.050
 After painting the box it was so I 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.559
 I put a sheet of sulphite paper in the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.649
 bottom of the box and I was putting layers 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:11.880
 of cellophane paper on top of the paper 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.880
 sulfite to give an air of water in the pool 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.810
 the last two layers of cellophane paper 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.680
 I glued on the edge of the plastic box with 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.350
 hot glue so it stays tight 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.140
 I glued a layer from one side to the other 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.130
 layer of the other is that it is easy to 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.520
 open the layers of paper 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.790
 cellophane to put the dolls have only 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.400
 a little glue of hot glue so that the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 two are fixed to one another more than 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000
 stay an opening 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.290
 and that's when you fit your dolls 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.560
 I reuse some chords from 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.229
 old toys of all my daughter 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.950
 the pt to play the role of the buoy 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.659
 pool 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.019
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.769
 this idea and until the next video a 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.769
 big kiss
