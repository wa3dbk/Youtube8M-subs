front foot up the board properly like

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.509 
front foot up the board properly like
right<00:00:42.019> here<00:00:42.440> your<00:00:42.769> knees<00:00:43.010> should<00:00:43.039> be<00:00:43.250> going

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
right here your knees should be going

forward dragging up the board and then

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.910 
forward dragging up the board and then
your<00:00:46.850> back<00:00:47.030> foot<00:00:47.359> should<00:00:47.390> be<00:00:47.690> coming<00:00:48.019> up<00:00:48.140> so

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
front foot and also the timing between

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.579 
front foot and also the timing between
your<00:00:53.390> front<00:00:53.660> foot<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:53.870> your<00:00:54.079> back<00:00:54.289> foot

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
because you see if you don't drag your

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.169 
because you see if you don't drag your
front<00:00:57.440> foot<00:00:57.589> up<00:00:57.739> properly<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.820> board<00:00:59.059> will

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
front foot up properly the board will

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.049 
front foot up properly the board will
never<00:00:59.390> go<00:00:59.629> into<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.050> air<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.649> if<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.760> don't

back<00:01:06.860> foot<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.250> actually<00:01:07.579> going<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.759> hold<00:01:08.090> your

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
back foot is actually going to hold your

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.080 
back foot is actually going to hold your
board<00:01:08.720> down<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.650> ground<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.790> some<00:01:11.060> of

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
board down to the ground so some of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.240 
board down to the ground so some of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
those your your back foot was actually

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.550 
those your your back foot was actually
stopping<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:13.939> from<00:01:14.180> getting<00:01:14.509> ollie<00:01:14.960> up<00:01:15.140> into

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
stopping you from getting ollie up into

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.740 
stopping you from getting ollie up into
the<00:01:15.680> air<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:16.939> just<00:01:17.149> a<00:01:17.270> point<00:01:17.540> of

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
the air and it's just a point of

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.289 
the air and it's just a point of
practice<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.680> point<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.100> timing<00:01:19.520> now

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
practice and just a point of timing now

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.030 
practice and just a point of timing now
the<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:21.020> way<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.409> set<00:01:21.680> up<00:01:21.710> skateboarding

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
the the way that I set up skateboarding

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.179 
the the way that I set up skateboarding
made<00:01:22.430> simple<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.060> you're<00:01:23.360> never<00:01:23.540> stuck<00:01:24.290> some

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
made simple so you're never stuck some

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.399 
made simple so you're never stuck some
people<00:01:25.549> get<00:01:25.729> this<00:01:25.880> idea<00:01:26.329> of<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.689> oh<00:01:26.899> it's<00:01:27.350> a

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
people get this idea of like oh it's a

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.929 
people get this idea of like oh it's a
trick<00:01:27.619> tip<00:01:27.799> video<00:01:28.100> or<00:01:28.369> they<00:01:28.490> give<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.759> like

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
trick tip video or they give you like

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.359 
trick tip video or they give you like
some<00:01:29.210> steps<00:01:29.869> they<00:01:30.229> break<00:01:30.469> down<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.860> steps<00:01:31.130> of

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
some steps they break down the steps of

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.679 
some steps they break down the steps of
the<00:01:31.969> trick<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:34.130> not<00:01:34.640> exactly<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.329> I

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
the trick and it is not exactly like I

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.330 
the trick and it is not exactly like I
don't<00:01:35.750> want<00:01:36.140> people<00:01:36.469> to<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.100> I'm<00:01:37.310> just

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
don't want people to think that I'm just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.450 
don't want people to think that I'm just
doing<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.119> different<00:01:38.420> parts<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.079> show<00:01:39.350> you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
doing the different parts to show you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.310 
doing the different parts to show you
how<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.520> ollie<00:01:40.939> works<00:01:41.450> because<00:01:41.930> that's<00:01:42.140> not

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
how the ollie works because that's not

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.859 
how the ollie works because that's not
it<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:42.740> all<00:01:42.890> I'm<00:01:43.549> actually<00:01:43.729> break<00:01:44.299> down<00:01:44.539> each

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
it at all I'm actually break down each

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.630 
it at all I'm actually break down each
step<00:01:45.289> into<00:01:45.649> something<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.130> you're<00:01:46.340> going<00:01:46.610> to

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
step into something that you're going to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.569 
step into something that you're going to
practice<00:01:47.119> on<00:01:47.630> its<00:01:47.810> own<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.829> for<00:01:49.039> example<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
practice on its own so for example the

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:50.889 
practice on its own so for example the
first<00:01:49.789> step<00:01:49.939> you're<00:01:50.210> just<00:01:50.479> going<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.750> practice

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
first step you're just going to practice

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.230 
first step you're just going to practice
tapping<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.649> tail<00:01:51.860> on<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.130> ground<00:01:52.240> that's

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
tapping your tail on the ground that's
