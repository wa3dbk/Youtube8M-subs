house you don't see the doors you can

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.310 
house you don't see the doors you can
double<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> line<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.079> know

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
double that line up and so you know

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
double that line up and so you know
