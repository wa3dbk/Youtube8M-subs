lacquer<00:01:16.040> mine's<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.220> exactly<00:01:17.640> called<00:01:17.970> lack

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
lacquer mine's not exactly called lack

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
lacquer mine's not exactly called lack
of<00:01:18.360> mine<00:01:18.570> called<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> bells<00:01:19.170> far<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.619> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of mine called the bells far but it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
of mine called the bells far but it's
the<00:01:19.860> same<00:01:20.100> concept<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.759> lacquer<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.780> it's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the same concept as lacquer so it's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.660 
the same concept as lacquer so it's
clear<00:01:22.140> glass<00:01:22.409> increases<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.130> ability

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
clear glass increases their ability

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
clear glass increases their ability
skills<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.240> text<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.439> basically<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
skills into text so it's basically the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.390 
skills into text so it's basically the
same<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.369> locker<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.130> also

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
same thing this locker and your go also

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.030 
same thing this locker and your go also
going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:29.820> some<00:01:30.210> clamps<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:32.009> i

binding things to these i use two of
these<00:01:48.270> big<00:01:48.899> paper<00:01:49.290> binding<00:01:49.770> homes<00:01:53.390> are<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
these big paper binding homes are you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.330 
these big paper binding homes are you
and<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.939> could<00:01:57.149> use<00:01:57.710> four<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.860> these<00:01:59.009> mini

clamps or you could just use two of them
and<00:02:02.009> you'll<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.180> how<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> clamp<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.140> why

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
and you'll see how to clamp it and why

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
and you'll see how to clamp it and why
so<00:02:05.850> yeah<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.509> clamps<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.619> everyday

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
they basically just come open those are

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.479 
they basically just come open those are
a<00:02:21.090> lot<00:02:21.300> stronger<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.260> these<00:02:23.130> ones

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
a lot stronger but these these ones

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.970 
a lot stronger but these these ones
these<00:02:24.150> paper<00:02:24.360> binding<00:02:24.810> clubs<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
these paper binding clubs get in the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.400 
these paper binding clubs get in the
concave<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.599> kicks<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.050> really

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
concave and like the kicks like really

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.380 
concave and like the kicks like really
good<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:30.620> last<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:32.069> least<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:33.120> going

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
good and last but not least you're going

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.339 
good and last but not least you're going
to<00:02:33.480> need<00:02:33.690> some<00:02:33.860> glue<00:02:35.569> right<00:02:36.569> here<00:02:36.780> i<00:02:36.810> use<00:02:37.050> weld

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
to need some glue right here i use weld

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.729 
to need some glue right here i use weld
weld<00:02:37.830> bond<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.140> um<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:43.110> mostly

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
weld bond as you can see um it's mostly

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.330 
weld bond as you can see um it's mostly
like<00:02:44.100> an<00:02:45.090> all-purpose<00:02:45.930> glue<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.130> works

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
like an all-purpose glue but it works

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.039 
like an all-purpose glue but it works
really<00:02:47.580> well<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:48.000> wood<00:02:48.750> um<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.540> at<00:02:51.540> first<00:02:51.780> it's

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
really well for wood um it at first it's

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.800 
really well for wood um it at first it's
like<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.350> milky<00:02:52.890> normal<00:02:53.280> glue<00:02:53.610> substance<00:02:54.330> and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
like a milky normal glue substance and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.360 
like a milky normal glue substance and
then<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.260> turns<00:02:55.500> into<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.849> turns<00:02:57.090> clear<00:02:58.370> so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
then it turns into a it turns clear so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.880 
then it turns into a it turns clear so
yeah<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.060> oh<00:03:00.330> one<00:03:01.200> last<00:03:01.410> thing<00:03:01.560> you're

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
yeah that's oh one last thing you're

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.680 
yeah that's oh one last thing you're
going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.069> need<00:03:02.190> something<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.790> spread<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
going to need something to spread the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.130 
going to need something to spread the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
glue it I just cut up some veneers that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.589 
glue it I just cut up some veneers that
I<00:03:07.170> had<00:03:07.349> left<00:03:07.620> over<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:09.000> use<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.299> or<00:03:09.480> you

I had left over and just use it or you

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.020 
I had left over and just use it or you
use<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:09.989> fingers<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> do
