your standard television whether it is a
widescreen<00:00:33.570> standard<00:00:34.320> definition<00:00:34.770> TV<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.550> one

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
widescreen standard definition TV or one

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.190 
widescreen standard definition TV or one
of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> square<00:00:36.180> TVs<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.630> we've<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:36.899> had<00:00:37.079> in

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of the square TVs that we've all had in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.950 
of the square TVs that we've all had in
the<00:00:37.290> past<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> basics<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.629> for

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the past this is the basics we have for

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.430 
the past this is the basics we have for
a<00:00:40.230> TI<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.520> now<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.440> 480

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
a TI all right now what that is is 480

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
a TI all right now what that is is 480
lines<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> resolution<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.719> stands<00:00:46.140> for

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
lines of resolution now the I stands for

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290 
lines of resolution now the I stands for
interlace<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> what<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> see

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
interlace and what it is if you can see

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
interlace and what it is if you can see
these<00:00:48.420> blue<00:00:48.660> lines<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.050> i<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.350> it's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
these blue lines that i have here it's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
these blue lines that i have here it's
every<00:00:50.670> other<00:00:50.850> line<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.750> interlace<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.559> like

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
every other line so interlace is like

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.020 
every other line so interlace is like
this<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.530> 13<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> five<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.579> then

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this you have your 13 and five and then

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
this you have your 13 and five and then
the<00:00:57.149> color<00:00:57.390> bars<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.710> four

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the color bars would be your two four

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520 
the color bars would be your two four
and<00:00:59.070> six<00:00:59.420> now<00:01:00.420> how<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> signal<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.350> there's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and six now how the signal is is there's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.319 
and six now how the signal is is there's
30<00:01:01.770> frames<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> second<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.820> they're<00:01:02.940> split<00:01:03.210> up

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
30 frames a second but they're split up

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
30 frames a second but they're split up
in<00:01:03.449> 60<00:01:03.960> cycles<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.339> actually<00:01:05.489> flickering

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in 60 cycles so it's actually flickering

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.640 
in 60 cycles so it's actually flickering
just<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.869> flicker<00:01:07.140> flicker<00:01:07.380> flicker

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
just like this flicker flicker flicker

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
just like this flicker flicker flicker
so<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> stands<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
so that's what the I stands for the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
so that's what the I stands for the
interlace<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.900> flickering<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.799> that's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
interlace will be flickering so that's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800 
interlace will be flickering so that's
why<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> camera<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> TV

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
why if you put a camera up to a TV

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.940 
why if you put a camera up to a TV
you'll<00:01:13.080> start<00:01:13.350> getting<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:13.770> weird

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you'll start getting all those weird

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950 
you'll start getting all those weird
lines<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> good

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
lines like that so this is a good

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
lines like that so this is a good
depiction<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> stands<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
depiction of what the I stands for and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
depiction of what the I stands for and
for<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> TI<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.110> any<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.619> eyes<00:01:19.770> which

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
for a TI or any of the other eyes which

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
for a TI or any of the other eyes which
we'll<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:21.299> p<00:01:21.600> now<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> your

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
we'll get to now p now this is your

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.200 
we'll get to now p now this is your
standard<00:01:23.040> DVD<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> DVD<00:01:24.119> player

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
standard DVD if you have a DVD player

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
standard DVD if you have a DVD player
that<00:01:24.570> used<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.960> progressive<00:01:25.409> all<00:01:25.530> over

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that used to have progressive all over

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
that used to have progressive all over
the<00:01:25.770> place<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.610> P<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.850> progressive<00:01:27.420> or

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the place the P is progressive or

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
the place the P is progressive or
picture<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.200> photo<00:01:28.229> however<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
picture or photo however you want to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.039 
picture or photo however you want to
call<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> P<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.900> like

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
call it so the P is actually just like

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.359 
call it so the P is actually just like
you're<00:01:31.200> seeing<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.130> actual

entire<00:01:35.220> picture<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.869> would<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
entire picture so how this would be is

entire picture so how this would be is
almost<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> movie

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
480p on a standard definition TV now

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
480p on a standard definition TV now
when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.619> HD<00:01:46.619> resolution<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
when you go into HD resolution there is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.810 
when you go into HD resolution there is
no<00:01:48.030> more<00:01:48.149> 720<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> there's<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.229> 720p<00:01:50.100> again

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
no more 720 I there's just 720p again

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960 
no more 720 I there's just 720p again
this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.329> exact<00:01:51.930> size<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.920> 720p<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
this is the exact size of a 720p on a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
this is the exact size of a 720p on a
1080<00:01:54.479> TV<00:01:54.810> which<00:01:55.020> we'll<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> second<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
1080 TV which we'll get to in second so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
1080 TV which we'll get to in second so
we<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.939> seven<00:01:57.270> hundred<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.600> twenty<00:01:57.810> lines<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
we have seven hundred and twenty lines a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
we have seven hundred and twenty lines a
resolution<00:01:58.799> progressive<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.299> actual

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
resolution progressive and the actual

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.319 
resolution progressive and the actual
resolution<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.140> 1280<00:02:01.619> by<00:02:01.799> 720<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.170> 720<00:02:04.799> TV

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
resolution is 1280 by 720 so on a 720 TV

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
resolution is 1280 by 720 so on a 720 TV
you'll<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> resolution<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.200> 720<00:02:07.890> lines

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you'll get the resolution of 720 lines

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070 
you'll get the resolution of 720 lines

described with the for ABI is its

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.690 
described with the for ABI is its
interlace<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> lines<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.670> little

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
interlace you can see the lines a little

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.730 
interlace you can see the lines a little
bit<00:02:25.940> better<00:02:26.060> now<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.840> course<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.170> 135

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
bit better now but of course it's 135

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.070 
bit better now but of course it's 135
and<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.940> then<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.360> black<00:02:29.510> lines<00:02:29.780> here

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and so on and then the black lines here

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.580 
and so on and then the black lines here
are<00:02:30.110> two<00:02:30.470> four<00:02:30.890> six<00:02:31.220> eight<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.350> this

it is you're interlaced is actually
doing<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> P<00:02:42.470> as<00:02:42.620> well<00:02:43.210> but

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
doing this you can do a P as well but

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.430 
doing this you can do a P as well but
they're<00:02:44.420> really<00:02:44.540> not<00:02:44.660> broadcasting<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.350> that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
out signal wise at 1080p and of course I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.120 
out signal wise at 1080p and of course I
can<00:02:53.960> mention<00:02:54.050> before<00:02:54.320> it's<00:02:54.710> progressive

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
can mention before it's progressive

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.040 
can mention before it's progressive
Progressive<00:02:55.460> progressive<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.900> best

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
quality you want the P on there the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.580 
quality you want the P on there the
progressive<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.990> want<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.230> highest

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
progressive and you want the highest

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.450 
progressive and you want the highest
number<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.700> here<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.000> at<00:03:02.210> 1080p
