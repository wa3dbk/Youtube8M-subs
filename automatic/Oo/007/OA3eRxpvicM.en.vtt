00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.510
 just a moment 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.980
 good afternoon, I welcome you to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.980
 olivÃ¡n girls 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.530
 bravo well 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.030
 curious very curious remember 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.910
 it is the wand that chooses the magician I believe 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.040
 that we can expect great things from you 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.870
 leaving apart the dance games and 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.519
 some other social game has not been 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.379
 no game for kinect that 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.750
 We would recommend even our worst 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.129
 enemy there has been no proposal 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
 that gave the right approach 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.930
 as to catch with your proposal to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.670
 great public and there that when 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.369
 we tried in addition to harry potter we 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.770
 let's get caught when we see that finally 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.340
 some study would break this curse 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.190
 we liked the demo and we love more the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.210
 game this product is developed 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.820
 by eurocom the same as curiously 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.310
 They now have layoffs for their next 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.740
 007 legends 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.689
 taking the movies as a base we will be 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.310
 harry potter having to solve 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.680
 many of the situations more 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.229
 characteristics of the films using only 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.119
 our body will have to perform 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.430
 the different actions catch objects 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.679
 move your hands to shake or throw 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.390
 spells put your arms in a way 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.060
 or another to indicate which spell we want 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.299
 use or say it out loud will ask for help 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.880
 to rum and hermione dodge attacks etc 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.920
 there are a lot of situations well 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.740
 Inspired by the different movies 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.179
 the orders apply well only in 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.860
 some moments are not captured 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.350
 correctly the signal that we produce 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 but in general the level of response is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.550
 optimum 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.830
 each mission has a good duration 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.420
 although there is some like the party of 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.570
 quidditch almost at the beginning of the game 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.490
 that the excessively long 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.010
 gameplay catches quite a bit from the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.140
 first instants the graphic section 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.850
 it's very good better than we 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.160
 we expected in a product of these 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.230
 characteristics in the sound has not been 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 told with the same voices of the film what 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 that introduces us better in this 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.080
 experience 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.170
 we like harry potter movies 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.430
 but the right thing and when playing it is evident 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.350
 that we are facing one of the best 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.010
 proposals that we have found for 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.010
 full and well done kinect 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 time
