00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.440
 and how very good I am packard and 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.930
 we are in a new video guys a 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.150
 advanced and good tutorial in this video 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 Well, I 'm bringing you this we're going to see here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.199
 an open passageway for our house 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.150
 and it's quite simple the truth is that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.470
 it comes out pretty fast and a 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.789
 tutorial on how to make this mechanism a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.880
 little resemblance I leave it here in the 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.590
 description is good and good 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.620
 the mechanism that I will teach to do 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.180
 Today is similar to that but a little more 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.699
 simple for people who still do not 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.610
 controls a lot of reston and those things and 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.300
 it is very easy you give here this lever and 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.720
 here you would be in yours in your 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.019
 lair is worth it so it's very simple 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.019
 true 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.230
 It is very simple and good 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.060
 to do this what we need is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.580
 the following things if you want to do 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.240
 a house then you make with wood I go to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.520
 do this time with wool is worth 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.930
 wool 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.320
 from Lima 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.170
 a type of block you catch on pistons 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.270
 sticky repeater 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 reston a lever 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.820
 and well I think it's already good and this 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.040
 block for forgiveness to cover what is 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 soil 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.900
 so once we have these little things 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.900
 We are going to a 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.470
 esplanade 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.290
 If I can find some 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.909
 I am in the middle of the forest 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.400
 good to move the country for snow 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.750
 but worth it 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.750
 let's remove the coal 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.340
 Well the truth is that it is very simple 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.750
 ok I'm going to do it up here and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.720
 you have to pass the same 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.920
 mechanism and put it under the ground 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.849
 as I said there we started putting 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.849
 they are doing 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.530
 a square of 2 x 2 and you do it the most 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.630
 deep that you can or good as you 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.150
 you want when we have this we put 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.700
 one side two sticky pistons worth 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.460
 good on each side means and when 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 you have these posts you put one watching 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.050
 for this block here is worth and here and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.170
 the same on the other side 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.600
 a oriented for here and a oriented 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.660
 for here when we have this like this 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.170
 we have to put two pistons here 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.870
 above oriented for there is also worth 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.340
 of this way I leave it here to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.850
 that you see 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.500
 once we have this done 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.450
 we put the block on top here here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.080
 above the slats is worth two in each 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.830
 two on this side here and two on this 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.830
 side of here is worth when we have these 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.450
 when we have the wool blocks 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.350
 posts here we have to put behind 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.680
 each decade piston these here 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.159
 down 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.819
 4 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:31.330
 so it looks better 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.730
 ok now we go with the repeaters 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.860
 when we have the repeaters we do 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.700
 we put two here 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.060
 2 here with 4 ticks each these 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.580
 We work with stand is worth but those of 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.130
 pistons 4 do them tips ie 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.720
 behind the whole 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.710
 and here others when we have everything done 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.580
 we take from the side and make a point 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.710
 uniting everything as if it were a 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.140
 square to which we become a 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.220
 square 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.750
 but as if it were 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.920
 so that you stay better 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.920
 you are not charging 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.340
 Robert I hope you fall down 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.709
 good and as you see is the mechanism remains 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.920
 the truth is that it is not difficult at all 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.590
 pretty simple and good when 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.340
 let's have this 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.520
 let's catch 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.870
 and I know 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.870
 let's make the floor 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.960
 that the soil would go 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.960
 here on top of the pistons 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.100
 next to add a little 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.100
 far this if we want to climb it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.699
 it's worth here 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.720
 well and here too 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.410
 when we have the soil, imagine that 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.270
 the lever is here and as you can see the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.270
 lever has to be here or here in 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.460
 these two sites here or in these two 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.710
 here because because when you activate 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.380
 the lever as you see gives strength here 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.450
 down and then you go the pistons 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.980
 do not worry about this because I eat 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.510
 you see here no force comes but with 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.620
 putting a re here 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.300
 you know what 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.220
 all this is done I have put 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.900
 the blocks over is now coming out here 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.909
 with wool because I have put the na 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.840
 but if I had put the material with 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.510
 the one that I told you that you could do it 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.050
 imagine it would all perfect 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.050
 I remove this 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.830
 soil 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.779
 I take away from these two and I'm left with only 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:55.569
 this would give us strength we go the lever to 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:58.000
 the current and it would stay open but 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.920
 if I give it 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.300
 good now because it's on this side of 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.520
 here it's worth 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.060
 if you notice but now I would have to 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.050
 put the re peter here there the repeats 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.320
 I'm 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.910
 if he repeats he goes there 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.910
 and it's worth 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.260
 where is the dark current more 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.650
 black is where we have to put the re 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.600
 peter and good as I tell you it would be all 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.680
 covered as if it were land and soil 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.419
 normal and if we close it it would be 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.430
 without doing any action as it is 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.860
 we would have built for you to give 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.900
 a 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.849
 an idea of ​​what I've done with this from 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.920
 the wool is worth 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.300
 well this change now the fix 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.770
 of the pistons here 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.770
 it's okay these 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.249
 A) Yes 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.589
 I'll give you 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:56.379
 and the ground so good now because it comes out 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:59.129
 well but logically it will remain normal 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.759
 with the descent of earth and 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:04.830
 normal the truth is that I do not want 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:08.719
 complicate life with making it wool 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:11.909
 and that almost I do all of land and 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:13.949
 remember those who are on this side of 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:16.949
 here it's worth not on the side of the pistons 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.739
 being / piston and piston then in one of 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.119
 these sides here or on the other side the 

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.399
 repeaters do not have to have any 

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:26.369
 guy has to be like that in the form 

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:30.149
 initial when we put them in those that 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:31.649
 They are above the targeted na for 

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:34.019
 pistons have to have four each 

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:36.330
 one on this side and on this and this then 

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:39.719
 well the pistons as we put them 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:42.360
 we unite everything with reston it is worth remaining 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:43.860
 all together and we put the lever on top 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.749
 of the arrest may be on this side of 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.149
 here or on this side of here but that 

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:49.169
 always be over the arrest and 

00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:51.119
 good kids I hope that I have 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.649
