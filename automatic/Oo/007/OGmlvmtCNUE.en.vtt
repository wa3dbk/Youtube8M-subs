the car on the way home they tend to get

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.580 
the car on the way home they tend to get
smudged<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.329> pretty<00:01:33.600> easily<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.409> nice<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
smudged up pretty easily so it's nice to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
smudged up pretty easily so it's nice to
have<00:01:34.860> something<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> wipe<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.640> off<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
have something to wipe it off when you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.819 
have something to wipe it off when you
need<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.409> but<00:01:37.409> yeah<00:01:37.759> um<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
need it but yeah um and here we have a

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.830

old<00:01:55.049> ipod<00:01:55.649> USB<00:01:56.070> cables<00:01:56.579> i<00:01:56.640> wonder<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:56.909> they'll

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
old ipod USB cables i wonder if they'll

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.440 
old ipod USB cables i wonder if they'll
still<00:01:57.180> fit<00:01:57.950> should<00:01:58.950> try<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.189> they're<00:01:59.729> small

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
still fit should try that they're small

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.670 
still fit should try that they're small
and<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> buttons<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> used

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and they don't have the buttons you used

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.330 
and they don't have the buttons you used
to<00:02:01.740> press<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> side<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> pull<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.310> i

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to press on the side to pull it out so i

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
to press on the side to pull it out so i
guess<00:02:05.850> when<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.630> stick<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:10.069> use<00:02:11.069> hold<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
guess when you stick in use hold it

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.750 
guess when you stick in use hold it
pull<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.830> okay<00:02:14.720> basically<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> same<00:02:16.760> all
