00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
Heavyweight Championship

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.930 
Heavyweight Championship
I<00:02:11.390> guess<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.989> one<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.489> tag<00:02:14.700> team

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I guess that that one or the tag team

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.440 
I guess that that one or the tag team
match<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:16.290> best<00:02:16.530> two<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
match are the best two of the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.300 
match are the best two of the
pay-per-view<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.830> champ<00:02:20.099> is

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
pay-per-view because the champ is

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.759 
pay-per-view because the champ is
championship<00:02:20.909> matches<00:02:21.269> but<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> tag<00:02:22.530> team

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
championship matches but the tag team

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.610 
championship matches but the tag team
match<00:02:23.090> for<00:02:24.090> me<00:02:24.239> was<00:02:24.450> probably<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.110> best<00:02:25.290> one<00:02:25.409> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
match for me was probably the best one I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.750 
match for me was probably the best one I
