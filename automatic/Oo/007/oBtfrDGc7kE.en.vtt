00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
so we'll just take a little bit right

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
so we'll just take a little bit right
here<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> form<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.320> normal

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619

hamburger<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:30.000> goes<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
hamburger and that goes right on to the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
hamburger and that goes right on to the
stove<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.710> these<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.820> been<00:01:32.939> cooking<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
stove so these have been cooking for a
few<00:01:33.630> minutes<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.560> we'll<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
few minutes and now we'll just take a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.910 
few minutes and now we'll just take a
spatula<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.180> flip<00:01:36.240> those<00:01:36.659> over<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.770> we'll

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
spatula and flip those over and we'll

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
spatula and flip those over and we'll
let<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.280> cook<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.240> few<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
let these cook for just a few more

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.390 
let these cook for just a few more
minutes<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.229> here's<00:01:40.799> what<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.040> look<00:01:41.070> like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
minutes and here's what they look like

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.069 
minutes and here's what they look like
after<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.850> finish<00:01:42.240> cooking<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.689> now

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
