00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.959
 look how he greets you blinking and that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.959
 I get with this is not a task you do not know 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.539
 a very very important thing first you 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.920
 you make a good amount of tear 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.680
 the tear 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:28.230
 cleaning and we are lubricating everything 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:30.090
 that you really have to have all at hand 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 Well, if we need them, we 're going to go 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.920
 kitchen is worth it because we are talking about 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 how food with those works 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.850
 we have to do to keep them well 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 that do not spoil us for later 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.229
 go back to cooking them and there are 20 reals and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.499
 we just saw that we have the table 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.690
 divided in two the countertop in the kitchen 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.699
 divided the red line cje that there is not 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 that clear transfer is generating 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.310
 very curious why 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.290
 it's a dramatization I do not think anyone 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.320
 has / unless it is a divorce 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.320
 friendly 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.830
 but good 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.100
 direct contact utensils table 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 knife our hands ours and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 our utensils that are our 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.410
 hands the good tools touch 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 many things and can really 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.030
 to contaminate, well, we were talking well 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.070
 I have done I moved my hands while 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.880
 we attend in maria angels or we have 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.590
 trust double double game thanks 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.660
 well let's see good mariangeles 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.910
 days from where he calls us hello good 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.860
 days from madrid from madrid as is 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.470
 happening the holidays because very 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.180
 practically tranquilita good but 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 sure you have some doubt now with 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.110
 this from meals the foods well 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.000
 that here although you wait a little bit in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.440
 subject given with which these and would play 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.830
 another food that is already prepared 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.009
 could contaminate what could I think that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 I take the tail if we do not cut the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.740
 a delicate food is altered 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.210
 fast then well we will not let it 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.520
 a lot of time we go to the fridge 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.140
 if any important that we said that 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.360
 had to freeze it worth before 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.690
 consume it good if we are going to consume it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.780
 in raw that the anisakis the heat a 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.450
 frying a normal oven deactivates it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.220
 Kills him then it's not necessary if we go 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.320
 to consume raw this wonderful 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.690
 bream if you have to freeze it 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.220
 18 or 20 degrees below zero at least 34 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.020
 days there are people that even that a 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.640
 week nothing frozen enough 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.320
 good to be raw material we are going to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.840
 put up look here we have prawns already 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.290
 that sergio beautifully put the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.020
 science if with paper with paper firewood the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.240
 not always with final filters 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.560
 we add to avoid a drip of such 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.030
 way that then if we have dishes 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.800
 prepared we are going to put the part 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.140
 superior also protected good but 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.910
 to avoid that possible drip of these 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.370
 raw foods and they are up there is not 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.140
 they are going to contaminate 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.239
 ok we are seeing everything with film 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.989
 transparent we have it here the role of 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.739
 the good in principle its mission would be 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.049
 similar are not they are materials that ais 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.049
 the raw twigs I can put them 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.579
 over even if now we have it 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.069
 completely isolated from flown 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.260
 the ideal would be to introduce it good here 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.879
 in really also what made them 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.620
 They are worth low for vegetables good 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.860
 we see as also parental pencil and so 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.860
 we see it 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.860
 and so we have everything perfectly 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.470
 isolated well we perfectly left there 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.360
 and we put a text that showed when 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.760
 we make the purchase what comes from outside 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.220
 you know another medicine 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 we have of buying each food and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.160
 especially the ones reflected and the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.650
 frozen very important and still 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.200
 we arrived arriving at the two flown that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.420
 it's going to the freezer, let's go here with 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.680
 the works that we carry all morning 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.240
 saying that we are going to take advantage of them 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.540
 value you have to know first 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.730
 save them well yes as I told you in 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.890
 this Christmas that multiplies the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.690
 works and leftovers of both raw materials 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.160
 as processed products is not very 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.800
 important to plan at the time of 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.390
 Thank you so much, I'm going to go 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.500
 leaving this in the fridge now I see you 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.500
 the two gray 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.080
 this I leave here organized in the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.700
 fridge that I'm going to susana is worth because 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.590
 We were taking care of ourselves a lot with the subject 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.060
 of food but you have to take care 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.200
 our body that we are saying that 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.690
 we do not stop this 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.740
 it's true we're really going to stretch 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.570
 a little 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.710
 let's start also we're going to 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.210
 organize as he was saying the 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.340
 doctor, let's organize the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.200
 stretch we start from above and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.940
 let's go down so that we 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.940
