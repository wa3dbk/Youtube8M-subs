maybe<00:04:59.150> it's<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.390> 20<00:04:59.780> and<00:04:59.960> then<00:05:00.200> this<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.470> like<00:05:00.590> a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
maybe it's a 20 and then this is like a

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.450 
maybe it's a 20 and then this is like a
20<00:05:01.130> or<00:05:01.540> select<00:05:02.540> here<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.770> can<00:05:03.950> see<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.310> I

20 or select here and you can see it I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.190 
20 or select here and you can see it I
mean<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.729> can<00:05:04.760> easily<00:05:05.240> cut<00:05:05.450> it<00:05:05.570> yourself<00:05:05.930> and

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
mean you can easily cut it yourself and

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.750 
mean you can easily cut it yourself and
you<00:05:06.229> just<00:05:06.620> get<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:06.919> some<00:05:07.100> little<00:05:07.250> curl<00:05:07.460> rise

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
you just get you some little curl rise

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.550 
you just get you some little curl rise
like<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.150> talked<00:05:08.479> about<00:05:08.780> then<00:05:09.050> just<00:05:09.229> curl<00:05:09.440> the

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
like I talked about then just curl the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.800 
like I talked about then just curl the
end<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.919> can<00:05:10.070> fix<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.400> yourself<00:05:10.570> but<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.630> feel

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
end you can fix it yourself but I feel

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.330 
end you can fix it yourself but I feel
like<00:05:11.870> they<00:05:11.990> will<00:05:12.140> be<00:05:12.169> saving<00:05:12.620> hair<00:05:12.830> they<00:05:13.100> just

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
fine and far spread apart so let's say

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.380 
fine and far spread apart so let's say
in<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:21.979> middle<00:05:22.040> of<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.490> hair<00:05:22.700> I<00:05:23.000> feel<00:05:23.270> like

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
in the middle of the hair I feel like

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.760 
in the middle of the hair I feel like
there's<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:23.600> gap<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:23.930> shouldn't<00:05:24.410> be<00:05:24.530> there

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
there's a gap that shouldn't be there

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.560 
there's a gap that shouldn't be there
you<00:05:25.280> can<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.640> would<00:05:25.880> be<00:05:26.030> able<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.240> see<00:05:26.360> through

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
you can you would be able to see through

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.969 
you can you would be able to see through
it<00:05:26.660> if<00:05:26.780> you<00:05:26.870> didn't<00:05:27.050> have<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.200> black<00:05:27.440> cap<00:05:27.800> I
