00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
I'm going to take these these sides down

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.800 
I'm going to take these these sides down
to<00:03:46.349> match<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.769> did<00:03:46.950> with<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.160> snap-on

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.860 

flip<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.959> air<00:03:52.170> back<00:03:56.420> because<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.690> also

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
flip that air back because this is also

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.300 
flip that air back because this is also
an<00:03:58.140> area<00:03:58.440> that's<00:03:58.560> going<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.860> tend<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.160> get<00:03:59.250> very

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
an area that's going to tend to get very

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.089 
an area that's going to tend to get very
matted<00:03:59.760> honor<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.420> we<00:04:01.019> don't<00:04:01.200> want<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.950> to

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
matted honor so we don't want to have to

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.850 
matted honor so we don't want to have to
leave<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> lot<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.640> excess<00:04:03.349> bulk<00:04:04.349> here<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
sides of her face and again you know

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.550 
sides of her face and again you know
like<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.130> said<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:08.549> kind<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:09.049> it's<00:04:10.049> knowing
