00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.550
 for you and for tonight I solved 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.050
 teach you a background of couscous 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.420
 artichoke w 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.609
 to start the speech already has a pan 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 that great pre-heated why not 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.879
 do a little big to bring several 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.100
 people 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:41.670
 I'll start answering oil 2 teeth 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 garlic is not interesting. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 people who feel chewed and their 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 big area 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.260
 so it's good to be very little or 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.899
 not accept what I already put 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.719
 crying I do not want them to stay 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.309
 future I 'm already with that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 daily perfume 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.350
 At that moment we will put three 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.810
 banana nanica and eight curly puppies 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.550
 the interesting band that she is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.940
 dead 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.400
 but his wife the band account 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.120
 she does not faint 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.000
 That's the point I already refused. 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.000
 now I'm going to add three males 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:40.789
 it is a granting cactus just to give too 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 A refugee I 'm dating even the 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.959
 scent of banana attentive and if we 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.390
 plant combines very well with food 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.369
 edition 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.079
 he is already here will increase one 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.939
 the fire was 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.310
 low heat and a flour money here 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.280
 I have the flaked cornmeal 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.849
 thick can see can leave the way 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:13.519
 that I'm going to put five cups too 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:19.370
 of flour people who are going to be a contest 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:21.349
 with this cornmeal I like it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:28.760
 because it has a special flavor it already 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:32.660
 has original blends well with a good 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.980
 I tried to get hot and I want to 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.630
 start adding the tomato sauce 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.329
 make sauce if you buy gravy 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.639
 Tomato is ready to be fermented in it. 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.220
 puts a pinch of salt a pinch of 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.260
 sugar and it is already at the point 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.750
 if you want to make your sauce 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.319
 Tomatoes and that the taste gets better 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.819
 still if you want to learn you have 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.819

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.120
 Why is he going to give us a call? 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.020
 at this point that is already well 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.410
 I think it's cool, who looks good. 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.920
 I'll show you a wet 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.280
 little pepper but it's a preparation 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.720
 of pepper is still all about 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.090
 we will add our 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.750
 red pepper, I picked it up at the time of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.190
 So you put it anytime you want. 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.190
 thing also combines well 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.780
 I'll add a little bit of cuzco 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.120
 It's already on the point. 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.530
 now just put this was mounted and 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.530

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.479
 the forms are already fulfilled and 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.270
 now you pass evenly here 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.840
 to stay low on the surface 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.090
