00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.639
 hello today in hotline video with 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.500
 You Yuri Sidorenko 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.969
 and the second version of the budget 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.410
 top representatives 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.140
 x-series fujifilm x20 external cameras 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 at least there are three changes inside 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 matrix cpu and viewfinder in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.910
 As a result, the x20 was head and shoulders taller. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.399
 its predecessor 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.649
 and on autofocus speed and on 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.269
 usability version 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.719
 silver metal parts 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.480
 top and bottom looks fantastic yes 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.789
 This is a retro design but the implementation is higher 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.070
 all praise the status of the product 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.769
 top grade confirm and materials and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 Excellent build quality on top 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.089
 panels are positioned and rising 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.429
 flash hot shoe to connect 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.069
 external blitz or radio synchronizer 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.710
 wheels to switch shooting modes and 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.830
 entering the expo amendment the shutter button and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.240
 user- definable button 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.760
 2 and 8 inch functionality 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.790
 LCD screen built-in boom panel but 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.920
 viewing angles are really large on the right 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.600
 there is a five-way joystick with 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.000
 additional control ring 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 parameters and 3 hardware buttons 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 on the left four more of the more expensive 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.880
 models in x20 migrated button ok chu 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.670
 calling screen with basic settings 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.500
 one more parameter control wheel 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 supports and presses above the screen 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 optical viewfinder eye with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.120
 diopter correction and sensor 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.260
 approximations 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.260
 photographer faces 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.570
 for the first time in the industry fujifilm has equipped 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.670
 compact optical camera 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.060
 overlay viewfinder 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 as is customary in mirror devices 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 focus area is displayed 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.580
 metering mode and exposure parameters 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.280
 also service information 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 for example a long warning for 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.580
 handheld shooting 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.979
 exposure when changing sensitivity 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.420
 the value is displayed as well as at 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.360
 entering expo amendment 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.239
 but a place for permanent withdrawal of all 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.940
 data missing viewfinder repeats 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.090
 changing the focal length of the camera but 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.970
 It shows 85 per cent of the future frame and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 in the wide-angle position also a piece 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.630
 lens near the viewfinder 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.760
 front-panel flash lever 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.489
 autofocus vapor lamp 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.530
 microphones and mode switch 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.420
 focusing 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.910
 battery and memory cards are closed total 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.049
 cover on the bottom of the case when 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.930
 tripod mount 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.700
 bay access is maintained 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.750
 metallic socket it is offset 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.190
 relative to the optical axis of the lens and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.709
 so the optical viewfinder became 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 a complete tool for choosing 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.609
 compositions and changes of basic settings 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 but the main innovation is use 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.320
 12 megapixel x-trans sims 2 matrix 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.530
 with a diagonal of 2 3 inches 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.109
 integrated phase sensors and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.510
 processor and xr2 as a result 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.690
 autofocus became accurate and fast and a 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.250
 the amount of noise has decreased 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.079
 fujinon high-aperture lens covers 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.069
 most requested range 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.410
 focal lengths from 28 to 100 12 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.370
 millimeters aperture of two 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.889
 wide angle up to 2 and 8 in body positions 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.230
 The main thing they are step-by-step though 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.250
 there is no ring on the lens for manual 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.010
 focusing 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.980
 this can be done very precisely thanks 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.099
 feature highlighting clear boundaries of objects 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.269
 and if the focus turns 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.879
 smooth texture is enough 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:54.090
 switch to normal zoom 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:56.430
 fragment confidence speed 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.640
 autofocus impressive 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.980
 the area can be selected from 49 available 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.980
 and its size is also adjustable 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.799
 last acceptable value a and salt 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.049
 for dzipeg 800 above the details disappear and 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.870
 1600 even with a strong decrease not 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.109
 impressive but from the raw file you can 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.410
 extract much even iso 3200 while 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.550
 some reservations can be set 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.970
 the device is able to shoot full hd video 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.639
 up to 60 frames per second 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.530
 autofocus works confidently but 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.900
 to achieve a smooth zoom 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.830
 will have to try as instead 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.880
 motor has to act hands 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.100
 a fly in the ointment 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.530
 no neutral filter in the chamber 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.830
 with such a color strong lens clear 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.960
 minus 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.450
 especially considering the need to buy 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.479
 adapter to use standard 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.919
 50 two millimeter filters and yet 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.139
 this is a wonderful machine 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.289
 he is lovingly designed with quality 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.720
 made and pleased with the results of filming with 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.900
 You flatline video were Yuri Sidorenko 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.710
 and compact retro camera fujifilm x20 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.710
 I wish you success
