00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
setting I was hoping that I'd be able to

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.399 
setting I was hoping that I'd be able to
do<00:03:03.980> any<00:03:04.209> length<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.389> shutter<00:03:05.900> speed<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.200> I

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
do any length of shutter speed that I

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.740 
do any length of shutter speed that I
wanted<00:03:06.799> but<00:03:07.670> on<00:03:07.819> bulb<00:03:08.060> setting<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.480> app<00:03:08.569> only

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
wanted but on bulb setting the app only

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.599 
wanted but on bulb setting the app only
lets<00:03:09.019> me<00:03:09.109> up<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.469> 30<00:03:09.680> seconds<00:03:10.189> so<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.340> was<00:03:10.579> a

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
lets me up to 30 seconds so that was a

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.259 
lets me up to 30 seconds so that was a
bit<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:10.909> letdown

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
bit of a letdown

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.629 
bit of a letdown
and<00:03:11.989> hopefully<00:03:12.349> once<00:03:12.769> again<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.069> an<00:03:13.159> app<00:03:13.400> and

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
and hopefully once again it's an app and

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.089 
and hopefully once again it's an app and
it's<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.359> software<00:03:15.109> driven<00:03:15.379> I<00:03:15.560> suppose<00:03:15.829> so

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
it's all software driven I suppose so

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.679 
it's all software driven I suppose so
it's<00:03:16.220> easy<00:03:16.459> for<00:03:16.669> them<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.849> update<00:03:17.030> stuff<00:03:17.450> like

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
it's easy for them to update stuff like

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.990 
it's easy for them to update stuff like
that<00:03:18.069> but<00:03:19.069> in<00:03:19.189> that<00:03:19.280> particular<00:03:19.549> instance

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
that but in that particular instance

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.479 
that but in that particular instance
yeah<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.180> little<00:03:20.419> bit<00:03:20.510> annoying<00:03:20.750> gotta<00:03:21.049> say<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
yeah a little bit annoying gotta say the

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.789 
yeah a little bit annoying gotta say the
other<00:03:22.609> thing<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.810> learnt<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.379> week<00:03:24.620> was

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
other thing that I learnt this week was

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.089 
other thing that I learnt this week was
the<00:03:24.919> panoramic<00:03:25.489> function<00:03:25.909> sucks<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.950> want

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
the panoramic function sucks if you want

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.530 
the panoramic function sucks if you want
to<00:03:28.159> take<00:03:28.310> Panos<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.879> suggest<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.359> try

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
to take Panos I suggest you try

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.789 
to take Panos I suggest you try
something<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.900> little<00:03:29.930> bit<00:03:30.109> differently<00:03:30.500> to

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
something a little bit differently to

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.459 
something a little bit differently to
the<00:03:31.430> pano<00:03:31.669> function<00:03:32.180> take<00:03:32.689> several<00:03:32.930> shots<00:03:33.079> and

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:33.469 
the pano function take several shots and

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:34.629 
the pano function take several shots and
stitch<00:03:33.620> them<00:03:33.650> together<00:03:33.829> in<00:03:34.129> software<00:03:34.489> later

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
stitch them together in software later

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.640 
stitch them together in software later
because<00:03:34.939> it<00:03:35.419> just<00:03:35.750> first<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.319> took<00:03:36.530> me

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
because it just first of all took me

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.110 
because it just first of all took me
five<00:03:36.859> or<00:03:37.010> six<00:03:37.189> guys<00:03:37.340> for<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.669> to<00:03:37.730> actually<00:03:37.879> let

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
five or six guys for it to actually let

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.220 
five or six guys for it to actually let
me<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:38.599> kept<00:03:38.750> coming<00:03:38.930> up<00:03:39.049> with<00:03:39.169> a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
me do it just kept coming up with a

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.020 
me do it just kept coming up with a
message<00:03:39.530> saying<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.459> had<00:03:40.639> to<00:03:40.730> hold<00:03:40.909> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
message saying that I had to hold the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.539 
message saying that I had to hold the
camera<00:03:41.209> steady<00:03:41.510> afford<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.019> do<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.549> panoramic

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
camera steady afford to do the panoramic

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.670 
camera steady afford to do the panoramic
photo<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.090> then<00:03:44.629> when<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.870> did<00:03:45.079> hold<00:03:45.229> it<00:03:45.349> steady

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
photo and then when I did hold it steady

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.559 
photo and then when I did hold it steady
and<00:03:45.979> it<00:03:46.400> finished<00:03:46.729> the<00:03:46.849> shopman<00:03:47.239> stitch<00:03:47.449> it

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
and it finished the shopman stitch it

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.030 
and it finished the shopman stitch it
all<00:03:47.690> together<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.409> maybe<00:03:48.650> it's<00:03:48.799> because<00:03:48.889> the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
all together and maybe it's because the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.619 
all together and maybe it's because the
horizon<00:03:49.459> had<00:03:49.579> he's<00:03:49.760> fairly<00:03:50.030> flat<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.419> there's

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
horizon had he's fairly flat and there's

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.740 
horizon had he's fairly flat and there's
not<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> lot<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:50.989> features<00:03:51.199> I<00:03:51.470> don't<00:03:51.680> know<00:03:51.739> but

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
not a lot of features I don't know but

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.210 
not a lot of features I don't know but
you<00:03:53.750> know<00:03:53.870> I've<00:03:54.199> never<00:03:54.319> seen<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> camera<00:03:54.889> put<00:03:55.189> a

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
you know I've never seen a camera put a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280 
you know I've never seen a camera put a
set<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.459> stairs<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.269> ocean<00:03:56.569> before<00:03:56.659> but

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
set of stairs in the ocean before but

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.280 
set of stairs in the ocean before but
the<00:03:57.500> Fuji<00:03:58.010> XT<00:03:58.549> one<00:03:58.729> managed<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.209> do<00:03:59.329> it<00:03:59.479> so<00:03:59.930> I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
the Fuji XT one managed to do it so I

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.619 
the Fuji XT one managed to do it so I
would<00:04:00.739> steer<00:04:00.979> clear<00:04:01.159> of<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.459> besides<00:04:02.449> that

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
would steer clear of that besides that

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.780 
would steer clear of that besides that
the<00:04:02.870> camera<00:04:03.199> itself<00:04:03.470> is<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.489> know<00:04:04.669> it

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
the camera itself is just you know it

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.129 
the camera itself is just you know it
excites<00:04:05.120> me<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:05.510> need<00:04:05.659> to<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> few<00:04:06.019> more

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
excites me I just need to get a few more

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.599 
excites me I just need to get a few more
lenses<00:04:06.500> for<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.799> I've<00:04:06.889> only<00:04:06.919> got<00:04:07.159> a<00:04:07.189> few<00:04:07.400> and

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
lenses for it I've only got a few and

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.119 
lenses for it I've only got a few and
they're<00:04:08.180> all<00:04:08.299> prime<00:04:08.569> lenses<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.259> everything

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
they're all prime lenses but everything

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.679 
they're all prime lenses but everything
was<00:04:10.340> quick<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.609> get<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:11.030> quick<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.449> change

one of the biggest setbacks of any

one of the biggest setbacks of any

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
camera that's not designed for video is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.060 
camera that's not designed for video is
the<00:04:46.759> audio<00:04:46.789> quality<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.840> here<00:04:48.529> I'm<00:04:48.650> using<00:04:48.860> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
the audio quality so here I'm using the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.680 
the audio quality so here I'm using the
GoPro<00:04:49.430> but<00:04:49.580> I've<00:04:49.700> gotta<00:04:49.849> know<00:04:50.060> if<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.419> can<00:04:50.539> see

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
GoPro but I've gotta know if you can see

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.020 
GoPro but I've gotta know if you can see
that<00:04:50.840> they're<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.200> little<00:04:52.130> external<00:04:52.430> mic

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
that they're a little external mic

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.270 
that they're a little external mic
into<00:04:53.330> zoom<00:04:53.570> h2n<00:04:54.170> and<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.740> gives<00:04:54.950> me<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.100> much

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
into zoom h2n and that gives me a much

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.770 
into zoom h2n and that gives me a much
better<00:04:55.310> audio<00:04:55.970> quality<00:04:56.030> than<00:04:56.540> if<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:56.690> was

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
better audio quality than if I was

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.750 
better audio quality than if I was
relying<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.350> mic<00:04:57.530> input<00:04:57.920> of<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.310> GoPro<00:04:58.670> or

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
relying on the mic input of the GoPro or

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.820 
relying on the mic input of the GoPro or
any<00:04:59.060> camera<00:04:59.420> for<00:04:59.600> that<00:04:59.630> effect<00:04:59.930> so<00:05:00.200> you<00:05:00.470> know

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
any camera for that effect so you know

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.830 
any camera for that effect so you know
if<00:05:00.920> you're<00:05:01.040> looking<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.400> record<00:05:01.760> video<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
if you're looking to record video the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.120 
if you're looking to record video the
best<00:05:03.110> thing<00:05:03.290> to<00:05:03.320> do<00:05:03.500> is<00:05:03.620> make<00:05:03.800> sure<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:04.040> get

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
best thing to do is make sure you get

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.520 
best thing to do is make sure you get
yourself<00:05:04.400> an<00:05:04.490> external<00:05:04.910> mic<00:05:05.260> don't<00:05:06.260> rely<00:05:06.500> on

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
yourself an external mic don't rely on

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.860 
yourself an external mic don't rely on
the<00:05:07.070> pre<00:05:07.610> ants<00:05:07.880> inside<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.360> cameras<00:05:08.690> they're

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
the pre ants inside the cameras they're

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.480 
the pre ants inside the cameras they're
just<00:05:09.020> not<00:05:09.170> meant<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:09.710> recording<00:05:10.250> video

them in there to help sell units they're
not<00:05:14.900> doing<00:05:15.230> it<00:05:15.350> so<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.590> can<00:05:15.770> become<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.190> cinema

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580

it<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.230> think<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:24.980> did<00:05:25.130> say<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.550> first<00:05:25.760> video

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
it I think I did say in the first video

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.540 
it I think I did say in the first video
that<00:05:26.270> when<00:05:26.540> you<00:05:26.660> take<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:27.020> raw<00:05:27.290> photo<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:28.280> can't

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
that when you take a raw photo it can't

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.090 
that when you take a raw photo it can't
transfer<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.270> app<00:05:29.420> but<00:05:29.710> somehow<00:05:30.710> it

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
transfer it to the app but somehow it

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.520 
transfer it to the app but somehow it
converted<00:05:31.460> into<00:05:31.640> a<00:05:31.790> JPEG<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:33.050> sucked

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
converted into a JPEG and and and sucked

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.490 
converted into a JPEG and and and sucked
it<00:05:33.650> across<00:05:33.920> to<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.280> app<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.330> you<00:05:36.260> know<00:05:36.350> if<00:05:36.440> you
