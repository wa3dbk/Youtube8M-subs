00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
the ball they do not come apart let's
imagine<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.290> Brian<00:01:46.649> were<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.310> we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
imagine if Brian were to do what we

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
imagine if Brian were to do what we
would<00:01:47.610> call<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.020> separation<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.530> move<00:01:49.860> his

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
would call a separation it move his

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.880 
would call a separation it move his
hands<00:01:50.250> back<00:01:50.670> away<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.180> his<00:01:51.509> body<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.680> he

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
hands back away from his body and as he

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.270 
hands back away from his body and as he
does<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.579> he<00:01:54.030> loses<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.930> power<00:01:55.439> position<00:01:55.770> of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
does and he loses the power position of

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
does and he loses the power position of
the<00:01:56.369> front<00:01:56.610> side<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the front side so let's go back to the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.640 
the front side so let's go back to the
regular<00:01:58.469> stance

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
regular stance

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.680 
regular stance
and<00:01:59.800> if<00:02:00.250> they<00:02:00.370> an<00:02:00.520> assignment<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.360> front

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
and if they an assignment to the front

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.780 
and if they an assignment to the front
side<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.710> front<00:02:03.160> side<00:02:03.550> is<00:02:04.350> responsible<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
side the front side is responsible to

side the front side is responsible to
take<00:02:06.790> us<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.180> ball<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.780> keep<00:02:08.320> us<00:02:08.470> in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
take us to the ball and keep us in

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.030 
take us to the ball and keep us in
alignment<00:02:08.920> that's<00:02:09.790> its<00:02:10.119> major<00:02:10.509> role<00:02:10.869> in

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
alignment that's its major role in

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.490 
alignment that's its major role in
setting<00:02:12.040> up<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.610> stroke<00:02:13.080> let's<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> the

that's<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.640> power<00:02:42.880> side<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.870> as<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.080> go<00:02:44.230> up

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that's the power side so as we go up

that's the power side so as we go up
that<00:02:44.620> side<00:02:44.950> there<00:02:45.280> one<00:02:45.730> more<00:02:45.910> time<00:02:46.209> if<00:02:46.420> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
that side there one more time if you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.630 
that side there one more time if you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
your way to the ball we go back again to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560 
your way to the ball we go back again to
that<00:02:56.680> equation<00:02:57.070> where<00:02:57.940> are<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.240> going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.540> be

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
that equation where are you going to be

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.960 
that equation where are you going to be
when<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:58.990> bad<00:02:59.500> stroke<00:02:59.950> or<00:03:00.190> you're<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.910> to

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
when you bad stroke or you're going to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.750 
when you bad stroke or you're going to
be<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.420> state<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.930> power<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.400> going<00:03:03.670> to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
be in a state of power are you going to

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.150 
be in a state of power are you going to
get<00:03:03.880> weak<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.540> your<00:03:04.750> way<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.230> balls<00:03:05.440> let's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
get weak on your way to the balls let's

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.570 
get weak on your way to the balls let's
also<00:03:06.820> look<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:07.630> cinemas<00:03:08.260> if<00:03:09.100> you're<00:03:09.280> looking

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
also look at cinemas if you're looking

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.699 
also look at cinemas if you're looking
at<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:09.850> got<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> yellow<00:03:10.300> cup<00:03:10.630> on<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.930> center<00:03:11.680> of

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
at we got a yellow cup on the center of

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.850 
at we got a yellow cup on the center of
home<00:03:12.010> plate<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.300> in<00:03:13.450> between<00:03:13.860> exactly

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
home plate so that is in between exactly

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.890 
home plate so that is in between exactly
in<00:03:14.950> between<00:03:15.310> both<00:03:15.550> feet<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.660> where

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
in between both feet and that's where

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.110 
in between both feet and that's where
the<00:03:17.019> belly<00:03:17.200> button<00:03:17.410> lives<00:03:17.800> as<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.610> come<00:03:18.820> up<00:03:18.850> to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
the belly button lives as we come up to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.850 
the belly button lives as we come up to
the<00:03:19.209> belly<00:03:19.390> button<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.019> that's<00:03:20.440> where<00:03:20.709> the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
the belly button and that's where the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.160 
the belly button and that's where the
head<00:03:21.040> lives<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.239> it's<00:03:22.420> almost<00:03:22.600> like<00:03:22.870> being

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
head lives and so it's almost like being

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.610 
head lives and so it's almost like being
on<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> pole<00:03:23.860> where<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:25.030> body<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.930> not<00:03:25.959> going

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
on a pole where that body is not going

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.070 
on a pole where that body is not going
to<00:03:26.709> go<00:03:26.890> linea<00:03:27.730> but<00:03:28.300> just<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.660> little<00:03:28.810> bit

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
to go linea but just a little bit

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.080 
to go linea but just a little bit
through<00:03:29.320> described<00:03:29.739> most<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.640> its<00:03:30.820> going<00:03:31.030> to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
through described most of its going to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.449 
through described most of its going to
rotate<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:31.750> he's<00:03:32.140> pretty<00:03:32.470> much<00:03:32.680> going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.070> stay

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
rotate so he's pretty much going to stay
