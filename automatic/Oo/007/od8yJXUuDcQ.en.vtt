00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
that then shooting like them all for

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.439 
that then shooting like them all for
their<00:05:10.289> 89<00:05:11.280> is<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.520> lowest<00:05:11.849> one<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.030> have<00:05:12.180> fought

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
their 89 is the lowest one I have fought

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.350 
their 89 is the lowest one I have fought
for<00:05:12.900> his<00:05:13.110> stats<00:05:13.349> which<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.740> ridiculous<00:05:14.120> so<00:05:15.120> my

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
for his stats which is ridiculous so my

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.089 
for his stats which is ridiculous so my

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
opinion he seems like a good player and

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.830 
opinion he seems like a good player and
