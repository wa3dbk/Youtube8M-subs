00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.930
 Hey, people, it 's not Tiago Amorim. 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.780
 I'm here to show you 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:21.199
 cleaning of my keyboard is a keyboard 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.980
 yamaha tse 403 is sometimes its key 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.750
 it is not working and it is usually 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.680
 this occurs when you have dirt on the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.020
 sensor is so let's go 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.790
 first you take all the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.670
 Bottom screws on bottom 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 turn him he puts him in the normal position 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.780
 You're so far away, it's not going to go here. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.890
 the screws on their keys appear. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.739
 his key is very easy to take out. 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.590
 The screw is usually in these 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.230
 so here you take a screw and 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.550
 and here you can see here in the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.729
 keyboard of these little holes here and you 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.709
 He only needs a zone and he comes back in London. 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.380
 AIDS is you can see here that part O 

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:20.990
 I already cleaned and that part that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.270
 continued the Puritan event and now 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.260
 I'm showing you what happens. 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.950
 there is usually dirt on you 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.160
 the sus is that on these sensors why 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 the keys are failing they are giving 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.510
 defend 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.910
 but it is these rubbers that the action does not 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.150
 I know if the roriz 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.490
 usually she is damaged as 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.090
 completed and why it does not reach 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.020
 more of the sensors so that not handle 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.590
 Aztecs 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.720
 so what happens on the website that comes with these 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.560
 rubber but if you want to do 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.600
 required gambiarra but thanks to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 God, mine still has not damaged 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.979
 and I said I'm cleaning the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.190
 because it has some keys that 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.680
 already starting to fail and I am 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.780
 cleaning will provide the sensors if 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.709
 If I'm going to have to change rubber 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.830
 buy let's take the technician I just go 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.830
 show you the amount of dirt 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:35.489
 It's not every day that you speak to 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.489
 you here how easy you get here O 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.300
 so what I advise you 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.450
 grab the keys you just took 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:54.459
 wash it with soap and water 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 dry them enough so that they do not come 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.070
 no liquid falls into these 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.239
 sensors and mainly it is 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.209
 highly corrosive and 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.070
 over time it will damage the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.519
 sensors and will not work anymore is 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.970
 so no rain on kicking your hands 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:21.280
 dry each button use a dryer on the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.170
 if I 'm here, I 've just washed my feet and 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.250
 that I let win 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.700
 I did not come to take any books on the sensors. 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:38.200
 and then you guys just do not 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:40.660
 confuse and only return in the place that 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.980
 you will be giving more life to the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:50.620
 your keyboard is not 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:53.220
 yesterday the channel hug and that's it 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.220
 thanks
