00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the fifth fret and the eighth fret and I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
the fifth fret and the eighth fret and I
would<00:01:44.759> use<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:44.939> pinky<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> eighth<00:01:45.810> fret

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
would use my pinky for the eighth fret

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.050 
would use my pinky for the eighth fret
so<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> looks<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.310> nice<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.579> slow

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.770 

so<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.119> see<00:01:53.240> how<00:01:53.299> it's<00:01:53.420> kind<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.659> just

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
so you see how it's kind of just

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.719 
so you see how it's kind of just
building<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.320> pattern<00:01:54.710> from<00:01:54.890> five<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.429> six

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
building this pattern from five to six

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.510 
building this pattern from five to six
to<00:01:56.090> five<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.539> seven<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.049> five<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.500> eight<00:01:57.679> so

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
to five to seven to five to eight so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.730 
to five to seven to five to eight so
visually<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.000> very<00:01:59.060> easy<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.630> see<00:02:02.649> then<00:02:03.649> I'm

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
visually it's very easy to see then I'm

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.709 
visually it's very easy to see then I'm
gonna<00:02:03.859> turn<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:04.490> lick<00:02:04.700> around<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.179> I<00:02:05.240> can<00:02:05.450> end

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
gonna turn this lick around so I can end

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.749 
gonna turn this lick around so I can end
it<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.409> after<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.799> do<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.069> eighth<00:02:07.219> fret<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it so after I do the eighth fret of the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.820 
it so after I do the eighth fret of the
first<00:02:08.060> string<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.690> gonna<00:02:08.899> head<00:02:09.110> back<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
first string I'm gonna head back to the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.220 
first string I'm gonna head back to the
second<00:02:10.220> string<00:02:10.519> seventh<00:02:11.450> fret<00:02:11.510> with<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:11.989> ring

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
second string seventh fret with my ring

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.280 
second string seventh fret with my ring
finger<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> I'm<00:02:14.569> going<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.959> note<00:02:15.110> right

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
finger so I'm going to that note right

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.860 
finger so I'm going to that note right
there<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.160> then<00:02:17.060> I'm<00:02:17.150> gonna<00:02:17.239> head<00:02:17.540> back<00:02:17.569> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
there and then I'm gonna head back to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.680 
there and then I'm gonna head back to
the<00:02:18.110> first<00:02:18.560> string<00:02:19.160> fifth<00:02:20.090> fret<00:02:20.180> with<00:02:20.390> my

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690

the first string fifth fret with my
index<00:02:20.989> finger<00:02:22.090> kind<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.209> cool<00:02:23.420> little<00:02:23.569> turn

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
index finger kind of a cool little turn

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.140 
index finger kind of a cool little turn
of<00:02:24.049> major<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.440> minor<00:02:24.500> blues<00:02:25.069> together<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:29.030> now

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
of major and minor blues together so now

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.420 
of major and minor blues together so now
it<00:02:29.239> looks<00:02:29.269> like<00:02:29.480> this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.429 

and<00:02:34.879> then<00:02:35.180> I'm<00:02:35.269> going<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> end<00:02:35.629> with<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.870> bend<00:02:36.290> on

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
and then I'm going to end with a bend on

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.600 
and then I'm going to end with a bend on
the<00:02:36.560> eighth<00:02:36.739> fret<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.189> second<00:02:37.579> string

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the eighth fret of the second string

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.309 
the eighth fret of the second string
going<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:37.970> bend<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.420> whole-step<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
going to bend that up a whole-step and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.720 
going to bend that up a whole-step and
then<00:02:42.319> maybe<00:02:42.470> add<00:02:42.709> some<00:02:42.920> vibrato<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.579> end

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
then maybe add some vibrato at the end

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:54.010 
then maybe add some vibrato at the end
so<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.120> sounds<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.420> this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.330 

okay<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.770> what<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.100> do<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
okay so see what you can do with that

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.520 
okay so see what you can do with that
