00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I've got a small fire set up here just

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.149 
I've got a small fire set up here just
for<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> demonstration<00:01:28.560> purposes<00:01:29.009> I'm

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
for kind of demonstration purposes I'm

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.350

gonna show you what this repel will do I

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.069 
gonna show you what this repel will do I
think<00:01:33.360> most<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.509> stuff<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.540> I've<00:01:36.780> used

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think most all the stuff that I've used

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.100 
think most all the stuff that I've used
the<00:01:38.240> insect<00:01:39.240> repellent<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.759> I

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
the insect repellent will do this so I

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.060 
the insect repellent will do this so I
gotta<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.470> careful

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
gotta be really careful

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370 
gotta be really careful
by<00:01:44.220> using<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.210> only<00:01:45.780> recommend<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
by using this I would only recommend it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
by using this I would only recommend it
an<00:01:46.590> emergency<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> I'd<00:01:47.820> only<00:01:47.939> recommend<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.469 
an emergency and I'd only recommend it
in<00:01:48.630> case<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.790> need<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> try<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> get

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you can see how that's kind of an

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
you can see how that's kind of an
accelerant<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.460> use<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> help
