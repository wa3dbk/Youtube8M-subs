00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.870
 this May 26, 8 months of the 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.840
 forced disappearance of the 43 students 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.099
 of the rural normal of ayotzinapa 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.019
 family companions of the students 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.240
 they have maintained mobilizations inside and 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.759
 outside of Mexico to demand the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.090
 live presentation of these young people 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.090
 let's see 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
 ah 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.189
 this scream sounds in the conscience this 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.340
 demand for justice expires eight months 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.300
 since last September 26 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.040
 relatives and survivors of the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.379
 tragedy have focused their struggle on the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.140
 claim that the disappeared are 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.910
 presented with life for felipe de la 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.739
 parent spokesperson 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.560
 students are still alive and the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.740
 responsible for the crime is the state 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.750
 we have always said they are alive 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.330
 because logically and analyzing the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.740
 situation with all of them we say that if 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.560
 they were dead they would not have 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.080
 delivered because the easiest but as 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.510
 they are alive is complicated for them 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.130
 present them suddenly and we can not 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.580
 doubt that the state has got the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.580
 hands there 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.590

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.369
 survivors of that fateful night 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.760
 but the third bus surrounded them 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.130

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.350

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.480
