rock this is rather complicated I'll put
some<00:02:56.329> shading<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.690> back<00:03:00.190> which<00:03:01.190> will

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
some shading in in the back which will

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.039 
some shading in in the back which will
bring<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.760> kind<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.569> bits<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.840> are

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
bring the kind of that the bits that are

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.970 
bring the kind of that the bits that are
to<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> fore<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> full<00:03:05.450> hmm<00:03:06.140> which<00:03:06.860> is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
to the fore to the full hmm which is

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.580 
to the fore to the full hmm which is
what<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.310> want<00:03:07.489> really<00:03:07.819> isn't<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:09.410> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
what you want really isn't it if that

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
makes sense and then this is not

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.039 
makes sense and then this is not
anatomically<00:03:13.280> correct<00:03:13.489> okay<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:14.299> don't<00:03:14.720> do

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
anatomically correct okay so don't do

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.220 
anatomically correct okay so don't do
