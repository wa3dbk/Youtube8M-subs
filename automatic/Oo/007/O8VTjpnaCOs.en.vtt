00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.070
 these gifts today I am going to 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.799
 teach how to download paper camera this 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.079
 application is an application for the 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.460
 effects camera that the truth is very 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:17.630
 good and it's paid on the google play 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.509
 so many people do not know her but 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.220
 is a long time is very well known and they 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.830
 I bring the latest version of google play 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 for you to download it for free 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.700
 I leave you close in the description that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.739
 he also aimed at rap download it and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.210
 self-leveling a pain in the bar with the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.230
 edge with the other file filter 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.559

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.559

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.520
 we have several settings 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.380
 the idea of ​​the application 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.260
 is to do 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.430
 a drawing of the photos that you are going to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.340
 take out and at the same time that you 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.880
 they are recording they are showing you how 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.009
 it would be good now 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.100
 playstation sorry for the light but good 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.220
 it would be a 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 not what bands 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.930
 as it would be a result although by the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 camera you will not be able to 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.619
 contrast shine line are you lines or 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.920

 to drawing they do not have more adjustments yet 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.540
 they are understood by the cartoons but 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.879

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.319
