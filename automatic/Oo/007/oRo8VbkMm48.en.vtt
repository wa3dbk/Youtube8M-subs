00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.820

 seen so if you want to know follow 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.450
 watching this video first I'm going to 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.369
 show the lit 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.670
 then the makeup the hairstyle and the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.410
 outfit the full look so remember 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.699
 the opener gio and subscribe if not what 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.699
 have done see you 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.370
 and I have my soil applied and now I 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.780
 I'm going to put the big cream all over the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.699
 face is always a very good angle 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.649
 As I had enough ojera I'm 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.789
 applying this one of nars that has a lot 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.789
 more coverage than others 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.890
 and the higuain fact of maybelline I'm going 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.140
 to put in all the high places to 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 that illuminated sidad with luminosity 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.730
 who knows and as always we blur 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.340
 very well the product and how did a 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.610
 clarita shade I'm going to apply this jumbo 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.130
 nik milk and I really like what 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.720
 we blend very well and how I'm going to use 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.430
 a shadow that has enough timer 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.530
 I find that the brushes that are 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.450
 foam adhere much better 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.760
 product so that's why apply with 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.550
 this and apply it all over the eyelid 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.190
 mobile is the shadow with top is the most 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.480
 blanquita from the romantic palette of to 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.940
 face 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.830
 and with the angular brush I'm going to 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.170
 moisten a little bit and with it 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.150
 tophane palette I will occupy the color 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.200
 dark purple and I'm going to start delineating 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.939
 all my eye 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.570
 I even find that it is much easier 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.549
 delineate it with damp shadows that with 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.360
 any other eyeliner so I 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.360
 I really like this option 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.130
 and also on the edge of the eyes but 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.479
 only half so that our mine will 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.110
 see a little more blush 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.330
 and we will also contain a little bit of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.070
 age that is not so dramatic 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 he also applied this concealer to 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.370
 eyebrows because I have them quite dark 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.260
 As I had told you I had a problem 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 with the paint so I prefer to put it 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.460
 over bone scope when people get 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.350
 it's based the series looks awful good 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.290
 that effect is the one that worried me that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.790
 wants that's why it blends very well and then 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.220
 that I like because I feel that the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.710
 leaves much more defined 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.700
 delineate my lips with this eyeliner 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.700
 from jordan to a very lilac color lilac 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.200
 and above, I'm going to apply this 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.650
 color of line crime that is beautiful 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.650
 beautiful 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.370
 as always at the end in Chinese my 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.370
 eyelashes and I apply you mascara 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.560
 to see that women are 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.090
 multifaceted 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.709
 putting on makeup and talking on the phone and 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 to spend is this mascara so 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.470
 very bad I am applying it in the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.470
 lower lashes 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.280
 and we are ready with the makeup 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.890
 and for the hairstyle the only thing we're going to 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.390
 to do is take it as a bun as you see 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.380
 leave hair like a ribbon 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.680
 and we will open it as a fan 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.010
 and it 's super easy if they want the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.000
 fan not so much as whip can 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.000
 put less hair 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.290
 and if they want me to be more controlled 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.050
 always totally the ends by the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.540
 same cole and then I open it again 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.170
 a little more thing that remains as a 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.170
 conchita 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.190
 and we go to the outfit 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.080
