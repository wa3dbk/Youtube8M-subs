00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello friends that welcome to another 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 video of poker karts mexico in this 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.360
 once we are in class number 15 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.120
 of blackjack and good what I'm going to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 teaching right now is an example of how 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.470
 we go when counting cards 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.020
 we are already in the casino 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.960
 right now they will not need tokens 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.779
 here the chips are just for decoration and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
 Well, I'm going to show you how they should be 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.789
 count the letters for this imagine yourself 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.669
 that you go to the casino find a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 Blackjack table how it is and what they are going 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.469
 to do is as follows from 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.230
 instant in which they feel they are going to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.230
 start with your card counting 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 imagine yourself 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.690
 maybe these letters already came out in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.019
 these letters are here in the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.809
 then discard basket 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.510
 you arrive to do this let's say 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 that you are this player here is going to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.649
 have another and here is going to have another 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 then remember when you arrive 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.470
 first the account starts at zero so 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 they have to go counting less 10 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.400
 - one 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.000
 0 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.020
 one 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.259
 but 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.890
 the account goes on 0 they want to do 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.960
 let's say they ask for 0 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.590
 an account is still at zero here 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 nine against nine ask the account goes on 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.570
 zero is already at least one here there is 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 are left then you already have at least 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.369
 one the dealer turns his letter goes on 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.369
 zero 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.130
 and the account is still in 0 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.310
 up there after this obvious the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 croupier deals but you must be 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.560
 attentive to the account the account was going at 0 to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.560
 from there we continue counting 0 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.909
 - 1 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.330
 - two 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.010
 - 2 the account goes at least 2 ok stays 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.569
 he stays and asks 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.700
 the account is still at least 2 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.530
 flip that one they have to get one the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.940
 account goes in minus three because it came out 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.239
 Y 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.280
 well here the group already pays or takes away 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.230
 chips of those who lost the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.840
 mind if I do not remember it well the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.580
 account goes in minus 3 comes out maybe me 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.459
 I got to be wrong at some point but 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.560
 is that I'm sometimes attentive to video in 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:00.870
 place of the game then suppose the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.980
 account was in - 3 - 4 - 5 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.980
 - 6 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:16.170
 they do not answer -6 is already in -7 nobody asks 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.840
 -8 the account goes on -8 from that 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:25.370
 you should continue to count less 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:30.069
 eight minus seven minus 6 - 7 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.069
 - 8 minus 9 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:41.560
 -8 you here ask for less 89 stay 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.410
 and they stay minus 9 in the account still 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.770
 being less 9 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.000
 and that's where the account goes 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.220
 -9 I still hope that they will understand 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.319
 this is how you should get to the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.019
 casino and they should be counting 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.599
 At no time should you lose the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.860
 account then now when you are 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:11.520
 letters from here come back 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.109
 to the shoe that's where you should 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:19.200
 retell from scratch ok 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.310
 here again how are all the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.070
 letters in the shoe the account is going 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.090
 again starts the -0 then we go - 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.080
 1 - 2 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.080
 - 3 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.870
 - two 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.620
 stays stays and asks for less two less 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.580
 three 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.580
 - two 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.710
 and there we stayed the account goes in less 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.500
 two in the other hand the account is going to 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.650
 continue at least two now how difficult 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.380
 is how much to bet let's say if the account 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.510
 goes in more 10 how much should I bet if 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.550
 the account goes in more 1 how much should I 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.860
 bet that is another issue that 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.920
 I will teach another class but first we must 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.630
 to know the real account the real account 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.390
 it's also another class is going to be the 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.620
 next I hope you see it and see you 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.620
 in the next video
