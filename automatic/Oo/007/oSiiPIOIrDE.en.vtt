00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
and stuff because I don't have a

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.250 
and stuff because I don't have a
consistent<00:04:05.909> schedule<00:04:06.239> even<00:04:06.840> though<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.959> want

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
consistent schedule even though I want

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.780 
consistent schedule even though I want
to<00:04:07.409> eventually<00:04:07.650> get<00:04:07.979> a<00:04:08.040> consistent<00:04:08.609> schedule

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
to eventually get a consistent schedule

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.439 
to eventually get a consistent schedule
down

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
down

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.509 
down
I<00:04:09.479> think<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.229> consistent<00:04:10.889> schedule<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.400> going

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
I think the consistent schedule is going

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.099 
I think the consistent schedule is going
to<00:04:11.579> be<00:04:11.699> more<00:04:11.879> of<00:04:12.030> something<00:04:12.269> I<00:04:12.510> shoot<00:04:12.780> for<00:04:12.989> in

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
to be more of something I shoot for in

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.390 
to be more of something I shoot for in
the<00:04:13.229> summer<00:04:13.440> seeing<00:04:13.859> that<00:04:14.010> people<00:04:14.280> aren't

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.710 
maybe even still in middle school and
they<00:04:25.889> can't<00:04:26.130> really<00:04:26.340> watch<00:04:26.669> if<00:04:27.060> they're<00:04:27.569> at

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
school obviously I always I hope they're

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.870 
school obviously I always I hope they're
not<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.770> when<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:31.979> stream<00:04:32.310> at<00:04:32.430> 2<00:04:32.639> p.m.

not so you know when I stream at 2 p.m.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.760 
not so you know when I stream at 2 p.m.
that's<00:04:33.270> that's<00:04:33.690> basically<00:04:33.900> pushing<00:04:34.620> it

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
that's that's basically pushing it

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.469 
that's that's basically pushing it
because<00:04:35.069> you<00:04:35.310> know<00:04:35.400> most<00:04:35.639> people<00:04:35.789> get<00:04:36.180> out<00:04:36.300> of

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
because you know most people get out of

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.689 
because you know most people get out of
school<00:04:36.660> around<00:04:36.990> 2<00:04:37.289> p.m.<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:38.160> what<00:04:38.340> if<00:04:38.460> they're

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
school around 2 p.m. but what if they're
