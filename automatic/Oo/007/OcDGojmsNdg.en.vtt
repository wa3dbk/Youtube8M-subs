passengers corresponding to the numbers

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.360 
passengers corresponding to the numbers
the<00:00:57.970> object<00:00:58.630> is<00:00:58.750> now<00:00:59.020> to<00:00:59.079> save<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.739> passengers

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
the object is now to save the passengers

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.310 
the object is now to save the passengers
now<00:01:00.760> what<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.090> can<00:01:01.239> do<00:01:01.360> with<00:01:01.510> each<00:01:01.750> boat<00:01:02.110> is

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
now what you can do with each boat is

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.069 
now what you can do with each boat is
you<00:01:02.710> can<00:01:02.890> go<00:01:03.130> forward<00:01:03.910> you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.329> see<00:01:04.479> this<00:01:04.600> boat

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
you can go forward you can see this boat

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.130 
you can go forward you can see this boat
going<00:01:05.409> forward<00:01:05.950> or<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.820> can<00:01:06.850> go<00:01:07.149> sideways<00:01:07.540> or

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
going forward or you can go sideways or

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.219 
going forward or you can go sideways or
you<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:08.799> go<00:01:08.950> backwards<00:01:09.280> but<00:01:10.240> once<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.990> boat

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
you can go backwards but once the boat

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.560 
you can go backwards but once the boat
is<00:01:11.470> full<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.190> can<00:01:12.220> no<00:01:12.490> longer<00:01:12.520> move<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.300> boat

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
is full you can no longer move that boat

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.840 
is full you can no longer move that boat
so<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.170> realize<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.740> have<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.250> get<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:15.550> green

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
so I realize I have to get this green

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.160 
so I realize I have to get this green
guy<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.330> so<00:01:17.320> I'll<00:01:17.560> move<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:17.950> boat<00:01:18.280> back<00:01:18.550> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
guy and so I'll move this boat back and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.200 
guy and so I'll move this boat back and
there<00:01:20.170> he<00:01:20.650> can<00:01:20.830> enter<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.159> boat<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.670> can<00:01:21.850> only

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
there he can enter the boat you can only

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.780 
there he can enter the boat you can only
enter<00:01:22.690> from<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.860> sides<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.460> see<00:01:24.490> little

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
enter from the sides you see little

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.000 
enter from the sides you see little
white<00:01:25.060> pieces<00:01:25.690> right<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.650> like<00:01:26.830> the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
white pieces right here it's like the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.190 
white pieces right here it's like the
life<00:01:27.190> rope<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.729> they<00:01:28.090> can<00:01:28.299> just<00:01:28.570> grab<00:01:28.840> I'll

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
life rope that they can just grab I'll

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.380 
life rope that they can just grab I'll
pull<00:01:29.560> themselves<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.790> would<00:01:30.970> move<00:01:31.150> this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
pull themselves on so I would move this

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.410 
pull themselves on so I would move this
one<00:01:31.659> forward<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.380> then<00:01:32.650> go<00:01:32.890> here<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.520> grab

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
one forward and then go here and grab

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.649 
one forward and then go here and grab
that<00:01:34.869> one<00:01:35.140> now<00:01:35.799> if<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.250> did<00:01:36.490> gret<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.180> could<00:01:37.510> also

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
that one now if I did gret I could also

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.560 
that one now if I did gret I could also
grab<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.170> red<00:01:38.350> one<00:01:38.590> here<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.220> then<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.450> could

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
grab the red one here and then I could

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.620 
grab the red one here and then I could
grab<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.140> green<00:01:41.380> one<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:43.119> would<00:01:43.420> go

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
grab the green one and then I would go

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.490 
grab the green one and then I would go
forward<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.729> grab<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.390> pink<00:01:46.659> passenger<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:47.350> I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
forward and grab the pink passenger so I

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.100 
forward and grab the pink passenger so I
was<00:01:47.650> able<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.979> save<00:01:48.250> all<00:01:48.549> five<00:01:48.970> passengers<00:01:49.659> now

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
was able to save all five passengers now

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.230 
was able to save all five passengers now
this<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.409> an<00:01:50.560> easier<00:01:50.920> level<00:01:51.430> there<00:01:51.850> are<00:01:51.939> cards

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
this is an easier level there are cards

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.789 
this is an easier level there are cards
that<00:01:52.479> are<00:01:52.630> harder<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.110> harder<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.619> for

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
that are harder and harder and for

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.140 
that are harder and harder and for
