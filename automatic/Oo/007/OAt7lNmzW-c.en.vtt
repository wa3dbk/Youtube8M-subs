00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
whole entire game this is the part that

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.010 
whole entire game this is the part that
bugs<00:04:30.690> me<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:32.180> don't<00:04:33.180> think<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.810> fee

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
bugs me and I don't think it's the fee

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.310 
bugs me and I don't think it's the fee
dopo<00:04:34.320> actually<00:04:34.860> because<00:04:35.780> for<00:04:36.780> me<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.139> son

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
dopo actually because for me and son

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.189 
dopo actually because for me and son
defeat<00:04:37.680> is<00:04:37.860> not<00:04:37.889> defeatable<00:04:38.840> because<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.020> I

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
defeat is not defeatable because that I

00:04:40.199 --> 00:05:07.150 
defeat is not defeatable because that I
can't<00:04:40.530> do<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.820> let's<00:04:45.030> give<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.240> try

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.130 

and<00:05:07.730> if<00:05:07.820> any<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.420> are<00:05:08.600> thinking<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:09.020> have

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
and if any of you are thinking you have

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.020 
and if any of you are thinking you have
to<00:05:09.290> conserve<00:05:09.710> fuel<00:05:10.040> cuz<00:05:10.760> I'm<00:05:11.030> morning<00:05:11.390> out

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
to conserve fuel cuz I'm morning out

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:23.160 
to conserve fuel cuz I'm morning out
like<00:05:14.030> it's<00:05:14.450> still<00:05:14.930> pretty<00:05:15.260> much<00:05:15.530> impossible

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.320 

then<00:05:24.170> you<00:05:24.350> just<00:05:24.560> flow<00:05:24.890> that<00:05:25.730> won't<00:05:25.970> get<00:05:26.180> you

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
then you just flow that won't get you

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.470 
then you just flow that won't get you
any<00:05:26.480> one<00:05:30.250> then<00:05:31.250> you<00:05:31.370> just<00:05:31.580> die<00:05:31.760> even<00:05:32.090> if<00:05:32.330> you

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
any one then you just die even if you

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.680 
any one then you just die even if you
save<00:05:32.780> fuel<00:05:33.140> for<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.670> last<00:05:34.670> like<00:05:35.030> shot<00:05:35.450> or

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
save fuel for the last like shot or

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:42.280 
save fuel for the last like shot or
whatever<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.440> still<00:05:37.340> impossible<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:41.510> let<00:05:42.170> me

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
whatever is still impossible and let me

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.810 
whatever is still impossible and let me
check<00:05:42.440> if<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.740> didn't<00:05:43.070> show<00:05:43.250> you<00:05:43.280> guys<00:05:43.520> anything

the reach like some random thing in the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.140 
the reach like some random thing in the
sky<00:06:00.170> sometimes<00:06:00.680> it's<00:06:01.130> like<00:06:01.250> a<00:06:01.310> satellite<00:06:01.790> and

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
sky sometimes it's like a satellite and

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.590 
sky sometimes it's like a satellite and
sometimes<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:02.870> like<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.110> Viking<00:06:03.710> ship<00:06:04.600> so

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
lasting impressions are this game is

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.650 
lasting impressions are this game is
pretty<00:06:12.200> good<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.800> it's<00:06:13.790> pretty<00:06:14.120> well<00:06:14.390> thought

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
pretty good and it's pretty well thought

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.410 
pretty good and it's pretty well thought
out<00:06:14.720> but<00:06:15.440> it's<00:06:16.190> not<00:06:16.400> unique<00:06:16.610> it's<00:06:17.030> kind<00:06:17.270> of

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.420 
out but it's not unique it's kind of

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.270 
out but it's not unique it's kind of
like<00:06:17.600> some<00:06:18.050> other<00:06:18.260> games<00:06:18.530> I've<00:06:18.710> played<00:06:18.830> before

and I guess it's actually pretty fun by
already<00:06:25.520> a<00:06:25.610> 4<00:06:25.910> out<00:06:26.060> of<00:06:26.150> 5<00:06:26.390> I<00:06:26.720> didn't<00:06:27.290> really
