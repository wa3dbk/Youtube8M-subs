00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.389
 tanker quite ready yes 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 I turn 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.530
 Hello everyone, Rage, we are today. 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.230
 talk about how to change from 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.920
 places to place a helicopter in particular 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.120
 tell you how to do it about 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.519
 the intricacies of us 28 on will get out just 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.890
 we need to tilt the helicopter 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.620
 a little bit back so we started 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.550
 and as if back but not very much 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.290
 and tilt it a little bit right this 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.070
 my moment contrary to maser to let a 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.370
 and sit back actually best 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.680
 use this procedure and make 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.130
 without not at speed that is, we let's 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.979
 once again on the plan and the helicopter back and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.159
 a little aside then jump out 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.520
 sit down again all elementary actually 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:25.010
 your garnish at this moment just presses 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.710
 the f1 key and is replaced in place by 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.090
 pilot's seat and we sit down accordingly 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.520
 in place of homer jump out 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.009
 as i show now one you again 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.320
 sit down on the pilot's seat in the case of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.090
 mate you naturally gulls on 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.710
 empty slot that is to place 2 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.049
 let's look again like this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.679
 done on midu ac pulse we cant 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.659
 a little bit back to the side we will pass and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.659
 everything just sat down 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.700
 what's the point on a big bite 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.490
 change it rings already on such 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.410
 height 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 as the menu you fly on to flies that time 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.240
 250 meters for the above 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.270
 what is the meaning of their transplant from this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.270
 let me take it up 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.939
 either the strangler leaves are knocked down 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.109
 get distracted well when he's on 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.230
 the place stands then it turns out you will 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:05.030
 fly forward for something stopping 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:09.590
 stop and time takes a very long time 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.220
 and yes no I do not agree often and 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.500
 grief you are where there is simply no well 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.540
 no way to reach the shore 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.540
 for example or just turovskoy before ears 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.780
 or let your mouth to release a 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.780
 grasp at disrupting let 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.480
 come on, Vladyka will work there 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.140
 if he comes he just falls traps well 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.090
 now maria 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.569
 and trap peresyadu you're just a man 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.569
 right away 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:58.489
 well, fun runs and that's the reason 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:01.340
 why it needs to be able to want and 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.019
 wrong morning she swims here we are 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.310
 now how many times ten repeated 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.129
 successively already very good result on 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.629
 bag we recorded let's show come on 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:20.239
 before that it's all very simple done 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:23.150
 On the viper in general, I just want to think 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.770
 at speed work like that but actually 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.060
 show is done on foot 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.720
 change one by one 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.410
 traps 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.050
 I think it is clear why it may be necessary 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:40.010
 actually but here come the traps 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.979
 transplants let's eat went and under the people 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.840
 went right away 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:55.180
 addresses and here they are transmitted from now 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:58.430
 went traps transplant once they way 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.500
 long time you can fly as much as you want 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.820
 enemy territory you he will not 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.229
 get in there with him heroes and very bullshit 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.630
 actually everything is elementary no avail with 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:13.070
 it becomes still easier nowhere 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.440
 nothing flush let's transplant on in 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.710
 nobody overwhelmed we are just passive 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.650
 on site and transplant spouse shkop 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:28.060
