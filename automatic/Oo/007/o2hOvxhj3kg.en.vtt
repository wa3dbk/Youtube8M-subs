00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 story number 3 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.360
 humanity begins 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 what's different in this sheet 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.310
 if the people you see 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.259
 they are the first man and the first woman 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.820
 who made them god 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.620
 you know his name 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.469
 is jehovah 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.039
 and the man and the woman were reached 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.390
 to call 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.700
 Adam and Eve' 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.000
 jehovah god did adam like that 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.590
 he took dust from the ground and with it he formed a 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 perfect body of man 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.490
 then I blow into the man's nose and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 Adam started to live 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.550
 God had a job to give he said 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.810
 that gave name to all the different 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.540
 kinds of animals 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.329
 Adam maybe study the animals by 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.800
 a lot of time to give the best name to 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.280
 everyone 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:23.260
 while adam did this he began to have 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.710
 One thing you know what those things were 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.860
 the animals were in pairs had 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 elephants and elephants that there were lions and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.170
 lions 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.659
 but Adam did not have a partner of his 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.050
 that's why jehovah made adam stay 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.710
 well asleep and I take a bone aside 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.500
 of rib using this rib jehovÃ¡ 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.670
 did to give a woman who came to be 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.730
 his wife 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.730
 how happy I was now 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.480
 and happy you must have felt eba 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.110
 for being in such a beautiful garden to live 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.470
 now they could have children and live together 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.470
 in happiness 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.140
 Jehovah wanted Adam and Eve to live 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.540
 forever 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.780
 I wanted them to make the whole earth 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 it was as pretty as the garden of ed 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.340
 when adam should be glad and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.830
 eva 'when thinking about doing this 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.730

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.440
 from the earth a nice garden 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.280
 but the happiness of Adam and Eve 'did not last 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280
