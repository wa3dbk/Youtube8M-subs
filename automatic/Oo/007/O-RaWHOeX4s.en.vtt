 "The simple prayer of the Rosary indicates the rhythm of human life" by John Paul II 

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:14.966
 Tell us about the Second Vatican Council: 

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:23.288
 "In fact, the secret of man is only in the mystery of the incarnate Word (in Jesus) 

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:26.210
 truly clear ". 

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.417
 The Rosary helps to open up in the light. 

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:38.704
 [...] (The man) consider the birth of Jesus teaches the holiness of life, 

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:48.394
 looking for the house of Nazareth learn the original truth of the family according to God's plan 

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:57.328
 listen to the Master in the secrets of public life receiving light into the kingdom of God, 

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:04.307
 and behind him on the road to Calvary learns the soteriological meaning of suffering. 

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.900
 Seek the last to Christ and his mother in glory, 

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:21.467
 see the purpose that each of us is called, if it is left to heal and the transformation of the Holy Spirit. 

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:32.147
 One can therefore say that every secret of the Rosary and thought, illuminates the secret of man. 

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:42.557
 At the same time, it is naturally brought to this encounter with the holy humanity of the Savior 

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:51.558
 many problems, hardships, traps and projects that affect our lives. 

00:01:52.918 --> 00:02:03.274
 "Cast on your care to the Lord, and He will sustain you" (Ps. 55, 23). 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:16.264
 Meditating with the Rosary means giving care to our gracious hearts of Christ and his mother " 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:23.815
 (The Apostolic Letter: Rosarium Virginis Mariae paragraph 25)
