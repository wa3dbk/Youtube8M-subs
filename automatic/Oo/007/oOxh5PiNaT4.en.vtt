 Last stint but I do not know that much 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.349
 people who need it because really 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 very intuitive thing and the person 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.700
 Can really learn alone more 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.770
 comment below you want more tips 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 here as I think a lot of people want it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.399
 experienced in the game did not care about it. 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.640
 I'm still bringing what's what. 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 how to catch how to find players in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 way as it happens for example if I 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.399
 want to look for haka zetti that you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.750
 they saw there that I have him 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 I come here on the market searched for 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 acasiete and ends this year only the goal 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.579
 of the normal face of the acasiete with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.770
 We were mixed here so I wanted to. 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 know what the acasiete report is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.760
 Cheap that has but I do not have to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 to be looking through a lot of things 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.200
 what do we ask people around here? 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.000
 minimum price and end up finding and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.909
 but it has an easier way of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.460
 if you stay 15 you know it comes here and everything is set up 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.790
 your squash to the squash board 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.490
 so go here make a spread of concept 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.340
 which for example adds the lacazette 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.409
 so he plays in league one and he is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.409
 French and we are going to look here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.610
 preserve type ers we will find it here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.070
 I had it 81 kilos before 79 so if I 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 I just want normal acasiete I'm going to the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.740
 player here 79 does not take the version with 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 Upgrade here on the team as I already 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 I have him on my team already appeared 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.860
 normal letter in it but for example if I 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.159
 come back here messi fit and let's go 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:00.829
 to play here bbva promise here 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.829
 You have to swap here 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.869
 therefore keep the messi 93 to 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.410
 of course the normal letter is expensive it has form 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.709
 that the messi 94 we put is that squeezes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.200
 square on it this point a sir 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.360
 milestone of our people thought that the messi 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.790
 inform his three letters tava 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.430
 compare the price here is cheaper this 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.430
 here three million three hundred and thirty 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.069
 thousand is worth it there is enough then it is 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.030
 Of course I'll buy now inclusive 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.900
 clothes 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 what coin is missing that thing but anyway is it then 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.940
 this is basically how you look for a 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.760
 face fit a pretty cool way 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.239
 because we really complained about it 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.760
 on the 14th until the players have 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.680
 many other other versions too 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 when the player the card informs him 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.720
 change of position in which we have to 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.950
 example here the rodrigo to the Brazilian 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.760
 naturalized Spaniard who plays in a 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.519
 he is naturally an attacker who 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.069
 this theme it for him like rn here like 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.019
 right wing will find only the cards 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.299
 reports but that moment of the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.209
 nickel gets run off says is the most 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.190
 Easy easy even is easy as well 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.850
