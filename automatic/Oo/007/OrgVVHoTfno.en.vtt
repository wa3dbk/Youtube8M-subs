00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
down the hill to the reaches the end try

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.920 
down the hill to the reaches the end try
to<00:02:30.520> collect<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:30.850> many<00:02:30.940> points<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.630> getting<00:02:31.870> as

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
to collect as many points and getting as

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
accelerometer so let's tap the starch

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.180 
accelerometer so let's tap the starch
we're<00:02:37.570> going<00:02:37.660> on<00:02:37.810> tap<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.440> we're<00:02:38.920> gonna<00:02:39.010> go

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
we're going on tap it and we're gonna go

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.800 
we're going on tap it and we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.370> use<00:02:39.550> our<00:02:39.790> accelerometer<00:02:40.360> gonna

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
ahead and use our accelerometer gonna

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.840 
ahead and use our accelerometer gonna
zoom<00:02:41.140> out<00:02:41.260> we're<00:02:42.070> gonna<00:02:42.160> go<00:02:42.280> ahead<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.430> use<00:02:42.580> up

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
zoom out we're gonna go ahead and use up

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.790 
zoom out we're gonna go ahead and use up
dismiss<00:02:43.450> everything<00:02:43.630> we're<00:02:44.410> going<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.710> use
