 Hello dear friends today with us 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:16.320
 unpacking to do do do unto up 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:18.690
 dear experts in the black package on 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.900
 in fact this package brought courier and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:28.550
 handed it to me wearing gloves 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 strange gesture department of unified protection 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.099
 ds-1 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.090
 I pay here for an apartment then everything 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.649
 understandable but actually let's 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's try to determine by touch what 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.840
 the package I feel something plastic 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.469
 we can assume that this discipline 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 something made of thick cardboard is possible 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.840
 some kind of poster and something soft 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.079
 Similarly, everything in the packages is still in the package. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 three more packages 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.930
 1 2 3 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.970
 And here I will add breakfast friends 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.660
 just want to disappoint you a little 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.300
 the fact is that you are 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.000
 you can't usually get it 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 such things are sent to the press as we 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.509
 press we got it but you have 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.080
 a chance to get such a similar building 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.220
 somewhere on the Internet 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.090
 for example on ebay 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.390

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.899

 Well, in general, what we have here is essentially 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.940
 this is evidence that our main character 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.110

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.150
 appears before us 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:31.229
 but it shouldn't distract well 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:35.099
 from such a terrible ruby action 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.860
 games going on in the city and this is by the way in 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.660
 trailers sounded group nirvana not 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.360
 by chance because this group is just 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.520
 from Seattle, what else do we know about this 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.680

 fire and smoke by the way speaking your energy 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:01.039
 in order to control these forces he 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:04.919
 gotta get a breath for example 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:08.460
 exhaust pipe more precisely from the exhaust 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.449
 the pipes we revealed the mystery of the plot of this game 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.780
 in fact 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.610
 employees dz hunt for our main 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.930
 a hero not because he has a super 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.940
 abilities 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.960
 but because he does not pay for 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.810
 electricity and water are all like ours so 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.070
