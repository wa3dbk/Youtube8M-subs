headphone<00:00:06.299> splitter<00:00:06.960> I'd<00:00:07.529> recommend<00:00:07.830> it

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
headphone splitter I'd recommend it

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.200 
headphone splitter I'd recommend it
because<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.550> never<00:00:08.639> really<00:00:08.940> know<00:00:09.059> when

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
because you never really know when

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.160 
because you never really know when
you're<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.540> need<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.929> know<00:00:10.019> you've

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
you're going to need it you know you've

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.110 
you're going to need it you know you've
got<00:00:10.320> your<00:00:10.440> audio<00:00:10.679> device<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:11.190> an<00:00:11.400> ipod<00:00:11.880> and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
got your audio device like an ipod and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.940 
got your audio device like an ipod and
someone<00:00:12.840> wants<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.080> listen<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> don't

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
someone wants to listen in but you don't

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
someone wants to listen in but you don't
want<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> give<00:00:14.400> over<00:00:14.880> your<00:00:15.330> headset<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.990> want

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
want to give over your headset you want

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to be able to listen to the same thing

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.370 
to be able to listen to the same thing
at<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.029> same<00:00:18.090> time<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> these

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
at the same time so you get one of these

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.260 
at the same time so you get one of these
like<00:00:19.560> why<00:00:19.800> adapters<00:00:20.369> because<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.000> only<00:00:21.119> have

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
like why adapters because you only have

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.609 
like why adapters because you only have
one<00:00:21.449> headphone<00:00:21.630> jack<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.080> your<00:00:22.320> audio<00:00:22.560> device

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
one headphone jack and your audio device

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.740 
one headphone jack and your audio device
and<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.100> splits<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> signal<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.359> fine

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and this splits the signal that's fine

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.620 
and this splits the signal that's fine
for<00:00:24.779> audio<00:00:25.410> output<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.820> what<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:27.119> audio

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
for audio output but what about audio

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.609 
for audio output but what about audio
output<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> input<00:00:29.869> well<00:00:30.869> here's<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> device

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
output and input well here's a device

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.190 
output and input well here's a device
twenty<00:00:32.489> dollars<00:00:32.759> right<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.120> similar<00:00:33.809> talk

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
twenty dollars right now similar talk

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.580 
twenty dollars right now similar talk
will<00:00:34.829> allow<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.430> split<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.510> signal<00:00:37.260> not

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
will allow you to split that signal not

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.910 
will allow you to split that signal not
just<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> output<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> input<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
just the output but the input as well so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
just the output but the input as well so
you're<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> phone<00:00:42.510> you've<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.320> your

headset in someone else wants to join in

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.160 
headset in someone else wants to join in
but<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.360> don't<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> take<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.870> headset

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
out so you plug in simul they can talk

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 
out so you plug in simul they can talk
on<00:00:49.680> their<00:00:49.860> headset<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> talk<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> your

on their headset you can talk on your

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.279 
on their headset you can talk on your
headset<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:52.079> simul<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> splitter<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.289> well

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
headset with simul the splitter is well

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.360 
headset with simul the splitter is well
this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.680> looks<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.219> said

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
this is what it looks like like I said

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
this is what it looks like like I said
it's<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> why<00:00:56.910> adapter<00:00:57.539> each<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's like a why adapter each one of the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.020 
it's like a why adapter each one of the
I<00:00:59.730> guess<00:01:00.090> outputs<00:01:00.829> has<00:01:01.829> its<00:01:02.129> own<00:01:02.219> volume

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I guess outputs has its own volume

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
I guess outputs has its own volume
control<00:01:03.420> independent<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.909> barely

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
control independent so if you can barely

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.310 
control independent so if you can barely
hear<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.570> friend<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.869> hear<00:01:07.049> everything

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
hear and your friend can hear everything

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
hear and your friend can hear everything
including<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> drop<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.549> pin<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.270> adjust

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
including a drop of a pin you can adjust

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
including a drop of a pin you can adjust
the<00:01:09.750> volume<00:01:09.900> accordingly<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:11.369> comes

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the volume accordingly it also comes

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
the volume accordingly it also comes
with<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.180> handful<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.930> adapters<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.070> case

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
with a handful of adapters just in case

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.240 
with a handful of adapters just in case
the<00:01:15.270> jacks<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:16.560> using<00:01:16.799> are
