100 and the 110 is about $100 and these
things<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> manual<00:00:54.780> pull<00:00:55.079> start<00:00:55.440> as

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
things don't have a manual pull start as

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.209 
things don't have a manual pull start as
you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.809> battery<00:00:58.109> dies<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you can see so if your battery dies you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.160 
you can see so if your battery dies you
can't<00:00:59.460> manually<00:00:59.910> pull<00:01:00.120> start<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> there's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
can't manually pull start it there's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.299 
can't manually pull start it there's
your<00:01:01.289> battery<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.559> said<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
your battery right there so I said for a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
your battery right there so I said for a
hundred<00:01:05.549> dollars<00:01:05.820> Moree<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> better

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
hundred dollars Moree you know I better

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890 
hundred dollars Moree you know I better
just<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> bigger<00:01:08.070> battery<00:01:08.720> once<00:01:09.720> again

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
just get the bigger battery once again

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
just get the bigger battery once again
this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> 20<00:01:10.590> 28<00:01:11.100> inch<00:01:11.340> cut<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.880> dealt<00:01:12.299> with

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this is a 20 28 inch cut I dealt with

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.230 
this is a 20 28 inch cut I dealt with
snapper<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> few<00:01:13.290> years<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.369> almost<00:01:14.520> 12<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
snapper for a few years for almost 12 I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.140 
snapper for a few years for almost 12 I
had<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.750> rear<00:01:15.930> engine<00:01:16.110> rider<00:01:16.909> can't<00:01:17.909> forget

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
had the rear engine rider can't forget

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.490 
had the rear engine rider can't forget
the<00:01:18.270> model<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:18.960> change<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the model but they don't change that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.460 
the model but they don't change that
much<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> seems<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> build<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> lighter<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
much this seems to build a lighter it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
much this seems to build a lighter it
does<00:01:22.680> turn<00:01:22.890> much<00:01:23.130> better<00:01:23.400> than<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> older

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
does turn much better than the older

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.880 
does turn much better than the older
model<00:01:25.580> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> rear<00:01:26.909> engine<00:01:27.090> riders<00:01:27.890> turn

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
model on the rear engine riders turn

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
model on the rear engine riders turn
radius<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.490> much<00:01:29.520> better

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
radius is much better

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
radius is much better
the<00:01:30.990> only<00:01:31.110> difference<00:01:31.560> thing<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.130> only<00:01:32.220> thing

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the only difference thing the only thing

the only difference thing the only thing
different<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.590> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
different that I got on this one that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.350 
different that I got on this one that
you<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:35.610> buy<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.630> option<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.530> these<00:01:38.360> anti

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you could buy as an option is these anti

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.050 
you could buy as an option is these anti
scalping<00:01:39.990> wheels<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.759> protect

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
scalping wheels what they do to protect

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.010 
scalping wheels what they do to protect
your<00:01:42.360> blade<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:44.210> actually<00:01:45.210> hitting<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
your blade from actually hitting the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
your blade from actually hitting the
ground<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.649> concrete<00:01:49.610> blade<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> that's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
ground or concrete blade and that's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.920 
ground or concrete blade and that's
basically<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.350> difference<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.570> actual

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
basically the the difference the actual

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.980 
basically the the difference the actual
option<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> got<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.600> does<00:02:00.780> have

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
option that I got for this it does have

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.399 
option that I got for this it does have
