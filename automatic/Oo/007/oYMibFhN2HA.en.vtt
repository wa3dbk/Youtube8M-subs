00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.140
 wondered how I was going to do the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.820
 contest we thought about photos of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.800
 time is a little bit is a bit restricted - 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.729
 and so we will not be able to offer you 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.140
 what we wanted to do 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.140

 three questions then the first 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.490
 madam question without looking up she 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.040

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.080
 Nintendo that's the doctor on the other hand 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.550
 I speak 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.170
 so when was it founded 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.790

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.350
 line up would be times I have 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.170
 second thoughts 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.360
 second question which is the main 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.610
 good mario creator it's 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.160
 questions a little fashion tf1 pay attention to the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.690
 walk and all that is to say that you 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 shows a leg of lamb or speaks of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.720
 leg of lamb for 20 minutes after 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.190
 what are you talking about during 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.160
 the emission of a leg of lamb and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.480
 nuggets mcdo the church but no but 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.560
 it's a little bit the questions these 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 stories that everyone has section 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.959
 of course, and then it went away the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.989
 price and the third question 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.970
 That said ziÃ© the responses was the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:30.120
 main loser means magro magro 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.820
 mario remember answer a coach icon 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.540

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.620
 dia or black the third question that 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.030
 does not even show web to the point 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.379
 that she is a best-selling marion of 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.140
 all time and the best-selling marine 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.000
 all my time is included with the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.950
 console to say that we take 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.519
 also to the game in bundle with the console 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.519
 when that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.420
 so is this super mario bros 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.459
 the very first on nes famicom all this 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.049
 that you have to pay it and that the 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.639
 console not open them the flapper of the 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.889
 cartridge the go out blow in 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.030
 because his native country 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.950
 and then it was the brothel but that's 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.109
 memories is what it was great 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.220
 mario world super mario world released on 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.290
 super nintendo 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.820
 so it was also stupid the cartridge 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.380
 the artillery blow a little less than 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.449
 the nes worked but since it's 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.070
