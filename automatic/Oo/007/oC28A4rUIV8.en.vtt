00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
few people saw the video actually spent

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.809 
few people saw the video actually spent
the<00:02:44.950> time<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.849> build<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.180> Lego<00:02:46.420> ball<00:02:46.750> like<00:02:47.709> this

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
the time to build a Lego ball like this

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.880 
the time to build a Lego ball like this
and<00:02:48.819> now<00:02:49.120> they've<00:02:49.390> done<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.780> time<00:02:50.049> it's<00:02:50.650> time

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
and now they've done the time it's time

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.490 
and now they've done the time it's time
to<00:02:50.950> do<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.400> crime<00:02:52.109> all<00:02:53.109> right<00:02:53.230> well<00:02:53.379> that

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
to do the crime all right well that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.110 
to do the crime all right well that
means<00:02:53.709> rolling<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.099> ball<00:02:54.250> down<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.640> hill<00:02:54.819> we

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
means rolling the ball down the hill we

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.280 
means rolling the ball down the hill we
need<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.329> see<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.569> it's<00:02:55.689> going<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.870> do<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.079> same

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
need to see if it's going to do the same

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.680 
need to see if it's going to do the same
damage<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:57.010> any<00:02:57.310> when<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:57.909> smashes<00:02:58.000> into<00:02:58.450> that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
damage if any when it smashes into that

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.690 
damage if any when it smashes into that
car<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.230> can't<00:02:59.440> get<00:02:59.560> permission<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.010> roll<00:03:00.519> it

actually<00:03:04.389> have<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> back-up<00:03:05.079> plan<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.620> know

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
actually have a back-up plan you know

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.199 
actually have a back-up plan you know
the<00:03:05.859> paved<00:03:06.099> road<00:03:06.220> up<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.609> an<00:03:06.730> Alameda<00:03:07.180> bomb

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
the paved road up to an Alameda bomb

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.660 
the paved road up to an Alameda bomb
range<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.930> same<00:03:08.829> grade<00:03:09.099> is<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.250> one<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.579> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
range the same grade is the one in the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.809 
range the same grade is the one in the
video<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.599> is<00:03:10.780> plenty<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.170> room<00:03:11.819> perfect

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
video and this is plenty of room perfect

so<00:03:13.269> all<00:03:13.389> we<00:03:13.420> need<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.659> do<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.930> get<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.109> car<00:03:14.349> put<00:03:14.650> it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
so all we need to do is get a car put it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.220 
so all we need to do is get a car put it
at<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.859> bottom<00:03:14.980> roll<00:03:15.790> our<00:03:15.970> Lego<00:03:16.000> ball<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.870> see

at the bottom roll our Lego ball and see
what<00:03:17.379> happens<00:03:17.769> it's<00:03:18.250> smashing

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.530 

it's<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.739> delicate<00:03:27.310> operation<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:28.269> eventually

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it's a delicate operation but eventually
