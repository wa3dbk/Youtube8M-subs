a<00:00:49.200> premade<00:00:49.730> gluten-free<00:00:50.730> pizza<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> those

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
a premade gluten-free pizza one of those

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
a premade gluten-free pizza one of those
Amy's<00:00:52.110> once<00:00:52.410> those<00:00:53.340> costs<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:53.820> eight<00:00:54.030> bucks

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
Amy's once those costs by eight bucks

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.670 
Amy's once those costs by eight bucks
and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.680> these<00:00:56.219> were<00:00:57.199> six<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.379> seven

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and I think these were six or seven

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200 
and I think these were six or seven
dollars<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.250> four<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.850> they're<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
dollars for four so they're kind of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
dollars for four so they're kind of
pricey<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.719> they're<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.020> good<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.710> then

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
pricey but they're really good and then

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789 
pricey but they're really good and then
I<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.300> ate<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:03.960> pizza<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:04.650> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
I just ate two of these pizza so I'm not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.410 
I just ate two of these pizza so I'm not
going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> make<00:01:05.070> another<00:01:05.339> couple<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> pizzas

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
going to make another couple of pizzas

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.679 
going to make another couple of pizzas
but<00:01:07.220> what<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> take<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.540> of

but what you can do is to take a can of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.350 
but what you can do is to take a can of
this<00:01:10.100> well<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.189> could<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.430> any<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.060> tomato
