well but a very unique feature for this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
well but a very unique feature for this
unit<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> ability<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.260> do

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
unit is I have the ability to do

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
unit is I have the ability to do
simultaneous<00:01:02.219> effects<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.480> turn<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
simultaneous effects so I can turn the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.670 
simultaneous effects so I can turn the
flanger<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.710> filter<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.530> can

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
flanger and the filter on and then I can

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.480 
flanger and the filter on and then I can
actually<00:01:07.830> adjust<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.610> ratio<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:10.490> both

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
actually adjust the ratio of both

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
actually adjust the ratio of both
effects<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.600> could<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.260> effect<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
effects or I could use one effect at a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:25.429 
effects or I could use one effect at a
time<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> delay<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:24.439> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
time so I have a delay right now I can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.870 
time so I have a delay right now I can
bring<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.440 

I<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.920> use<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.159> Jaws<00:01:32.399> wheel<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> control<00:01:33.240> some

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I can use the Jaws wheel to control some

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
I can use the Jaws wheel to control some
of<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.600> effects<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
of these effects or I can just use the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
of these effects or I can just use the
buttons<00:01:35.969> themselves<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.659> use<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.899> X<00:01:37.079> Y

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
buttons themselves and use the X Y

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.789 
buttons themselves and use the X Y
parameters<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.720> very<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:39.990> nice<00:01:40.350> feature<00:01:40.649> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
parameters a very very nice feature of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.410

the<00:01:41.220> three<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.549> four<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> ability

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the three to four is I have the ability

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990 
the three to four is I have the ability
to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.259> cue<00:01:43.740> points<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.220> looping<00:01:44.789> or

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to do some cue points and looping or

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
to do some cue points and looping or
sampling<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:46.079> fly<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.799> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
sampling on the fly and that's that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:02:45.860 
sampling on the fly and that's that's
very<00:01:47.520> very<00:01:47.700> nice<00:02:43.609> so<00:02:44.609> now<00:02:44.790> then<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.239> save<00:02:45.660> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
very very nice so now then I save a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.309 
very very nice so now then I save a
bunch<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.170> Q<00:02:47.329> I'm<00:02:48.329> actually<00:02:48.480> going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.780> stop<00:02:49.049> it

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
bunch of Q I'm actually going to stop it

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.199 
bunch of Q I'm actually going to stop it
and<00:02:50.000> go<00:02:51.000> into<00:02:51.150> sample<00:02:51.660> mode<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.280> I'm<00:02:54.090> actually

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and go into sample mode and I'm actually

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.199 
and go into sample mode and I'm actually
going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> eject<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.989> disc<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:56.060> use<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
going to eject the disc and use the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.290 
going to eject the disc and use the
