 transform these images of objects by these products 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.360
 with the result really something interesting 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760
 helped frutal we are

 the medicine 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.640
 chaired by our elite 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.660
 edgy pgr 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.770

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.210
 and here for being medical songs 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.350
 we can add more features of our models the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.610
 breakable parent 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.700
 where the collision would cause the stone to attack the part 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.880

 since the colors punished by breaking the different of the image each coming 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 One of the characteristics of models made of parts is the possibility of 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.060
 same 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.070
