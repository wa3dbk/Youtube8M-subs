00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
I've always wondered how to repair these

I've always wondered how to repair these
radios

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
radios

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.850 
radios
I<00:00:05.960> have<00:00:06.960> several<00:00:07.230> like<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:09.620> most<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.769> them

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
I have several like this most of them

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.089 
I have several like this most of them
don't<00:00:11.010> work

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
don't work

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.890 
don't work
GM<00:00:14.099> put<00:00:14.880> these<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> lot<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.360> cars<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
GM put these in a lot of cars in the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.490 
GM put these in a lot of cars in the
very<00:00:16.109> early<00:00:16.500> 90s<00:00:18.080> they're<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.380> an

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
very early 90s they're really an

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
very early 90s they're really an
expensive<00:00:19.830> option<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.699> them<00:00:20.880> don't

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
expensive option so a lot of them don't

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
expensive option so a lot of them don't
exist<00:00:21.090> anymore<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.710> works

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
exist anymore this one works

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.540 
exist anymore this one works
this<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:23.970> works<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.480> little<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:26.039> glitchy

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this one works a little a little glitchy

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.330 
this one works a little a little glitchy
but<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> works<00:00:27.289> overall<00:00:30.140> setup<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.820> Trans<00:00:32.820> Am<00:00:33.030> I

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
but it works overall setup a Trans Am I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.470 
but it works overall setup a Trans Am I
got<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.550> way<00:00:35.730> from<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> junkyard<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
got it this way from the junkyard the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
got it this way from the junkyard the
car<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.840> wrecked<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> still<00:00:38.610> had<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
car was wrecked but it still had the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.690 
car was wrecked but it still had the
Senate<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> took<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.610> but<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.540> wonder<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
Senate so I took it but what I wonder is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.529 
Senate so I took it but what I wonder is
does<00:00:44.700> anybody<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
does anybody out there know how to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.279 
does anybody out there know how to
repair<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.379> CD<00:00:46.620> module<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.690> style<00:00:49.020> CD

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
repair the CD module this is a style CD

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
repair the CD module this is a style CD
module<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.309> believe<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.270> made<00:00:51.390> by

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
module it has I believe it's made by

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.439 
module it has I believe it's made by
technics<00:00:52.670> that's<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> original<00:00:54.270> ones

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
technics that's what the original ones

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.650 
technics that's what the original ones
looks<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.550> they<00:00:56.550> use<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.180> until<00:00:57.329> like

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
looks like they use these up until like

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
looks like they use these up until like
90s<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.859> some<00:00:59.010> later<00:00:59.219> radios<00:00:59.609> look<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
90s and some later radios look like that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.340 
90s and some later radios look like that
have<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.289> module<00:01:02.359> which<00:01:03.359> ended<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> lot

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
have this module which ended up in a lot

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
have this module which ended up in a lot
of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> theft<00:01:04.799> lock<00:01:05.040> radios<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.930> this

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
of the theft lock radios just like this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.320 
of the theft lock radios just like this
one

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.480 

these<00:01:12.170> are<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.350> bit<00:01:12.500> more<00:01:12.530> reliable<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.340> can

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
these are a bit more reliable you can

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.270 
these are a bit more reliable you can
generally<00:01:13.850> find<00:01:13.880> these<00:01:14.680> fixable<00:01:15.680> or<00:01:15.980> still

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
generally find these fixable or still

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.010 
generally find these fixable or still
working<00:01:16.700> much<00:01:16.970> like<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.270> one<00:01:17.420> in<00:01:17.570> my<00:01:17.660> 95

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
working much like the one in my 95

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.470 
working much like the one in my 95
century<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:19.220> has<00:01:19.400> this<00:01:19.970> style<00:01:20.300> module<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.360> it

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
century it has this style module and it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.180 
century it has this style module and it
works<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:23.780> fine<00:01:24.460> now<00:01:25.460> these<00:01:26.210> old<00:01:26.270> ones

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
works just fine now these old ones

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.900 
works just fine now these old ones
usually<00:01:28.190> what<00:01:28.490> I've<00:01:28.580> seen<00:01:28.790> them<00:01:29.000> do<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:30.910> when

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
usually what I've seen them do is when

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.010 
usually what I've seen them do is when
you<00:01:32.000> first<00:01:32.030> turn<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.570> radio<00:01:32.810> on

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
you first turn the radio on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.080 
you first turn the radio on
it'll<00:01:33.620> take<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.920> CD<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.310> it'll<00:01:34.520> try<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.730> spin

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
it'll take the CD and it'll try to spin

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.690 
it'll take the CD and it'll try to spin
it<00:01:35.210> up<00:01:35.300> but<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.630> won't<00:01:35.810> do<00:01:35.930> anything<00:01:36.260> with<00:01:36.440> it

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
it up but it won't do anything with it

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.770 
it up but it won't do anything with it
then<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.790> won't<00:01:37.850> subject<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.360> until<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:38.630> turn

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
then it won't subject it until you turn

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.500 
then it won't subject it until you turn
the<00:01:38.900> radio<00:01:39.140> off<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.530> then<00:01:39.620> turn<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.890> back<00:01:40.040> on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
the radio off and then turn it back on

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.730 
the radio off and then turn it back on
if<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.630> radio<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.900> on<00:01:42.020> for<00:01:42.260> more<00:01:42.380> than<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.620> few

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
if the radio is on for more than a few

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.080 
if the radio is on for more than a few
seconds<00:01:43.130> it'll<00:01:43.310> just<00:01:43.520> click<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.760> click<00:01:44.060> click

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
seconds it'll just click a click click

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.050 
seconds it'll just click a click click
click<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.720> won't<00:01:44.870> do<00:01:44.990> anything<00:01:45.940> so<00:01:46.940> what

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
click and it won't do anything so what

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.500 
click and it won't do anything so what
I'm<00:01:47.150> asking<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:48.850> does<00:01:49.850> anybody<00:01:50.330> out<00:01:50.479> there

know how to repair these I mean most of
these<00:01:53.720> are<00:01:53.930> pushing<00:01:54.280> 20<00:01:55.280> years<00:01:55.460> old<00:01:55.700> now

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
these are pushing 20 years old now

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
little capacitors all over the board and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.600 
little capacitors all over the board and
stuff<00:02:01.940> those<00:02:02.119> could<00:02:02.330> go<00:02:02.450> bad<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:04.160> chips<00:02:04.430> could

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
do it possibly these transistors here I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.449 
do it possibly these transistors here I

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
have never been able to figure out how

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.740 
have never been able to figure out how
to<00:02:19.519> fix<00:02:19.760> these<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.570> how<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> fix<00:02:20.959> these<00:02:22.750> I've

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
to fix these and how to fix these I've

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.199 
to fix these and how to fix these I've
learned<00:02:23.989> how<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.110> fix<00:02:24.380> these<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.209> find

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
learned how to fix these I find

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.580 
learned how to fix these I find
information<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.840> these<00:02:26.989> before<00:02:27.140> when<00:02:27.500> these

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
information on these before when these

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.509 
information on these before when these
quit<00:02:27.950> working<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.540> got<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.140> working

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.650 

this<00:02:34.519> one<00:02:34.730> working

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.210 

more<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.680> their<00:02:41.680> more<00:02:42.680> down<00:02:42.830> there<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.190> you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
more of their more down there but you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.450 
more of their more down there but you
can't<00:02:43.550> really<00:02:43.670> see<00:02:44.000> him<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:45.560> way<00:02:45.770> way<00:02:46.430> over

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
can't really see him one way way over

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.050 
can't really see him one way way over
here<00:02:46.880> can't<00:02:47.390> see<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.600> too<00:02:47.870> dark<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:49.000> want<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
here can't see it too dark I want to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.480 
here can't see it too dark I want to
know<00:02:50.120> how<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.240> fix<00:02:50.420> these<00:02:51.250> there<00:02:52.250> aren't<00:02:52.430> many

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
know how to fix these there aren't many

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.990 
know how to fix these there aren't many
of<00:02:52.640> them<00:02:52.790> left<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:55.340> one<00:02:55.550> looks<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.790> that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
of them left this one looks like that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
of them left this one looks like that
what<00:02:56.330> suspect<00:02:57.140> that's<00:02:57.320> why<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.530> one<00:02:57.800> doesn't

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
what suspect that's why this one doesn't

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.750 
what suspect that's why this one doesn't
work<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.420> rest<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.840> is<00:02:59.990> right<00:03:00.950> here<00:03:01.130> it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
work the rest of it is right here it's

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.220 
work the rest of it is right here it's
just<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:02.030> part<00:03:02.240> right<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:02.510> cuz<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:02.780> trying<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
just a part right now cuz I'm trying to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.140 
just a part right now cuz I'm trying to
figure<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:06.250> not<00:03:07.250> as<00:03:07.640> going<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.000> take

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
figure it out it's not as going to take

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.310 
figure it out it's not as going to take
this<00:03:08.330> this<00:03:08.810> one<00:03:09.050> this<00:03:09.680> came<00:03:09.920> out<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:11.320> what

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
this this one this came out of a what

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.980 
this this one this came out of a what
did<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.500> get<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.740> out<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:15.100> tire<00:03:16.100> transport

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
did I get this out of the tire transport

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.330 
did I get this out of the tire transport
yeah<00:03:17.990> because<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.590> think<00:03:18.650> that's<00:03:18.890> what<00:03:19.010> Putnam

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
yeah because I think that's what Putnam

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.190 
yeah because I think that's what Putnam
called<00:03:19.610> those<00:03:19.820> not<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.840> as<00:03:20.930> good<00:03:20.960> of<00:03:21.110> shape

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
called those not in as good of shape

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.160 
called those not in as good of shape
like<00:03:22.030> move<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.210> knob<00:03:23.450> on<00:03:23.480> everything<00:03:24.050> this

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
like move on a knob on everything this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.680 
like move on a knob on everything this
one<00:03:24.350> works<00:03:24.880> well<00:03:25.880> I'm<00:03:26.000> not<00:03:26.120> doesn't<00:03:26.450> work<00:03:26.540> on

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
one works well I'm not doesn't work on

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.860 
one works well I'm not doesn't work on
this<00:03:26.810> one<00:03:27.020> anymore<00:03:27.380> but<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:28.630> found<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.750> way<00:03:29.840> to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
this one anymore but I found a way to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.690 
this one anymore but I found a way to
modify<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.880> nobody<00:03:31.880> uses<00:03:32.390> balance<00:03:32.900> so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
modify it that nobody uses balance so

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.460 
modify it that nobody uses balance so
the<00:03:34.700> balance<00:03:35.060> now<00:03:35.360> back<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.870> forth<00:03:36.080> exactly

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the balance now back and forth exactly

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.340 
the balance now back and forth exactly
the<00:03:36.590> volume<00:03:36.980> knob<00:03:37.130> on<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.400> base<00:03:37.640> plate<00:03:38.350> this

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
the volume knob on this base plate this

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.190 
the volume knob on this base plate this
one's<00:03:39.590> completely<00:03:39.740> originally<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.910> works<00:03:41.200> but

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
one's completely originally it works but

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.360 
one's completely originally it works but
it's<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.410> little<00:03:42.650> glitchy<00:03:42.890> once<00:03:43.130> in<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> while

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
it's a little glitchy once in a while

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.740 
it's a little glitchy once in a while
sometimes<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.850> doesn't<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.270> take<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.540> CD

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
sometimes it doesn't like to take the CD

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
sometimes it doesn't like to take the CD
in<00:03:44.930> all<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.170> way<00:03:45.260> but<00:03:45.440> that's<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.680> only

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
in all the way but that's the only

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.620 
in all the way but that's the only
problem<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.250> really<00:03:46.460> has<00:03:52.210> but<00:03:53.210> if<00:03:53.270> anybody<00:03:53.570> out

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
problem it really has but if anybody out

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.030 
problem it really has but if anybody out
there<00:03:53.750> knows<00:03:54.020> how<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:55.390> fix<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:57.080> module<00:03:57.560> or

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
there knows how to fix this module or

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.240 
there knows how to fix this module or
has<00:03:58.310> advice<00:03:58.610> on<00:03:58.790> fixing<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.330> module<00:04:00.250> that

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
has advice on fixing this module that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.830 
has advice on fixing this module that
would<00:04:01.400> be<00:04:01.520> fantastic<00:04:01.730> I'd<00:04:02.330> love<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.660> know<00:04:02.750> how
