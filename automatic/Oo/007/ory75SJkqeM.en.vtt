00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
that I was just supposed to produce it

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.040 
that I was just supposed to produce it
and<00:04:15.350> Steve<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.010> essentially<00:04:16.520> here<00:04:17.050> well

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050

and Steve is essentially here well
there's<00:04:18.260> more<00:04:18.440> blues<00:04:19.070> based<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.610> more

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
there's more blues based and more

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.260 
there's more blues based and more
traditional<00:04:21.890> in<00:04:22.040> terms<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.580> blues<00:04:23.060> and

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
traditional in terms of blues and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.150 
traditional in terms of blues and
country<00:04:23.300> music<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:24.020> was<00:04:24.320> gonna<00:04:24.560> be<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:24.800> way

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
country music it was gonna be that way

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.210 
country music it was gonna be that way
and<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.330> come<00:04:26.510> out<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.840> way

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
and so it's come out that way

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.980 
and so it's come out that way
but<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.250> think<00:04:28.580> if<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:29.000> made<00:04:29.420> records<00:04:29.870> and

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
but I think if we made records and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.020 
but I think if we made records and
future<00:04:30.350> then<00:04:30.530> would<00:04:30.710> just<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.640> would<00:04:31.700> just<00:04:31.910> be

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
future then would just it would just be

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.510 
future then would just it would just be
anything<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.660> would<00:04:32.780> just<00:04:32.960> be<00:04:33.190> probably<00:04:34.190> even

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
anything it would just be probably even

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.950 
anything it would just be probably even
more<00:04:34.760> stuff<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.120> we<00:04:35.390> written

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.560
