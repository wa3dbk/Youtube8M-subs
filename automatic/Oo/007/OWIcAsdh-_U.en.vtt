00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
have a an LED display on the back of an

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.010 
have a an LED display on the back of an
LED<00:00:21.160> backlit<00:00:21.580> display<00:00:21.640> on<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.300> notebook<00:00:22.600> right

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
LED backlit display on a notebook right

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.590 
LED backlit display on a notebook right
so<00:00:23.890> is<00:00:24.190> it<00:00:24.280> a<00:00:24.430> full<00:00:24.700> display<00:00:25.090> or<00:00:25.360> is<00:00:25.450> there

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
so is it a full display or is there

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.080 
so is it a full display or is there
something<00:00:25.780> engraved<00:00:26.020> in<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.590> in<00:00:26.950> the<00:00:27.090> class

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
something engraved in the in the class

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.380 
something engraved in the in the class
and<00:00:28.420> then<00:00:28.539> it<00:00:28.660> just<00:00:28.840> slides<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.350> or<00:00:30.390> actually

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
and then it just slides on or actually

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.590 
and then it just slides on or actually
we<00:00:31.600> are<00:00:31.750> using<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.410> LED<00:00:33.250> backlight<00:00:33.699> with<00:00:34.390> the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
we are using the LED backlight with the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.040 
we are using the LED backlight with the
IM<00:00:35.050> injection<00:00:35.949> film<00:00:36.190> so<00:00:37.059> we<00:00:37.210> can<00:00:37.420> create<00:00:37.659> all

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
IM injection film so we can create all

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.540 
IM injection film so we can create all
the<00:00:38.350> graphic<00:00:39.280> you<00:00:39.550> want<00:00:39.819> with<00:00:40.659> the<00:00:40.989> RGB<00:00:41.739> LED

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the graphic you want with the RGB LED

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.110 
the graphic you want with the RGB LED
then<00:00:43.120> you<00:00:43.420> can<00:00:43.659> quit<00:00:43.899> any<00:00:44.229> color<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:44.800> want

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
then you can quit any color you want

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.479 
then you can quit any color you want
alright<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.359> this<00:00:46.749> is<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:46.929> one<00:00:47.289> thing<00:00:47.710> your

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
alright so this is a one thing your

numbers ultimately we are demonstrating
the<00:01:45.860> display<00:01:46.600> for<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:49.390> smallest<00:01:50.390> led<00:01:51.040> in<00:01:52.040> the

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
the display for a smallest led in the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.090 
the display for a smallest led in the
market<00:01:52.490> right<00:01:52.670> now<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:54.110> that's<00:01:54.320> an<00:01:54.410> SMD<00:01:54.710> part

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
market right now so that's an SMD part

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.930 
market right now so that's an SMD part
or<00:01:56.050> SMD<00:01:57.050> part<00:01:57.290> alright<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.040> it's<00:01:58.400> very<00:01:58.580> thin

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
or SMD part alright so it's very thin

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.910 
or SMD part alright so it's very thin
how<00:01:59.240> fun<00:01:59.480> is<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.660> can<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.050> tell<00:02:00.410> us<00:02:00.440> more<00:02:00.560> or

how fun is it can you tell us more or

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.719 
how fun is it can you tell us more or
less<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.280> one<00:02:01.640> millimeter<00:02:02.060> or<00:02:02.980> 0.4<00:02:04.150> times<00:02:05.650> 0.2

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
less is one millimeter or 0.4 times 0.2

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.640 
less is one millimeter or 0.4 times 0.2
millimeter<00:02:07.899> okay<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:08.960> how<00:02:09.260> high<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.740> is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
millimeter okay so how high is it is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.550 
millimeter okay so how high is it is
101.3<00:02:12.650> millimeter<00:02:13.420> 0<00:02:14.420> 1<00:02:14.630> point<00:02:14.870> 3<00:02:14.959> millimeter

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
101.3 millimeter 0 1 point 3 millimeter

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.500 
101.3 millimeter 0 1 point 3 millimeter
is<00:02:15.860> very<00:02:16.160> thing<00:02:16.430> Wow<00:02:16.900> okay<00:02:17.900> all<00:02:18.320> right
