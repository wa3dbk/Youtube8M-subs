and this one I think is really pretty
because<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.360> colorful<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.359 
happens to be too short to use as a
dress<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.350> always<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.190> as<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
dress you can always use it as a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.770 
dress you can always use it as a
cover-up

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.480 

now<00:01:45.780> let's<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.469> black<00:01:46.710> t-shirt<00:01:47.159> dress

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
now let's do the black t-shirt dress

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
now let's do the black t-shirt dress
this<00:01:48.179> one<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.810> bit<00:01:49.049> different

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
this one was a little bit different

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
this one was a little bit different
because<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> used<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.310> t-shirt<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> logo<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
because I used a t-shirt with a logo on

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
because I used a t-shirt with a logo on
it<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> had<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.289> flip<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.770> inside<00:01:53.130> out<00:01:53.429> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it so I had to flip it inside out in

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
it so I had to flip it inside out in
order<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.969> use<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.630> once<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.229> crossed<00:01:55.560> both

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
order to use it and once I crossed both

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.490 
order to use it and once I crossed both
sides<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> dress<00:01:56.880> over<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.990> logo<00:01:58.319> became

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
sides of the dress over the logo became

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
sides of the dress over the logo became
less<00:01:58.920> visible<00:01:59.429> but<00:01:59.609> you<00:01:59.670> could<00:01:59.819> still<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
less visible but you could still see it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
less visible but you could still see it
a<00:02:00.600> little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> definitely<00:02:01.829> would

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a little bit so I definitely would

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.850 
a little bit so I definitely would
