00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello everyone in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.049
 make a request that you have asked me 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.180
 by facebook a photo which stood da 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.510
 some pretty red without decoration or 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.510
 nothing 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.900
 but someone asked me what color 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.419
 was and I said it was a gel four of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.420
 then you want me to make this video 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.370
 so you could see how I use it even though I've 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 answered haberes girls saying that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 normal use as if it were a gel 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 normal then good as you have 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.089
 asked for it here you have it and well I'm going to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 zoom in so you can see it more than 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:51.300
 close and we started good because with the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.790
 clean and filed nails and with the cuticle 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.100
 done backwards the first thing that I'm going to 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.479
 put is the dehydrator already 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.479
 next the 1st 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.440
 now the first step that I'm going to do 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.180
 before putting the color layer as 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.690
 I said in the first video that I went up to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.510
 channel I do I put prime in normally 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.220
 I do not use the base gels but in this 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 case as I will put a color in all 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 the nail in these cases when it is like that yes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.700
 I like to put the base capita 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.550
 so that the color is not directly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.560
 on the nail then good a capita 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.300
 very very basic base and I have in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.300
 the lamp for two minutes 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.340
 without cleaning the capital what we have left 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.500
 sticky from the base capital I'm going to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 use this color 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 What is the red that I mention disdain 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.170
 and good eye a little to be 4 d is very 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.270
 very exquisite so I take a little 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.599
 and I 'm going to expand it all over the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.599
 a 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.250
 well when I arrive I have so painted 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 with the orange stick I pass through the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.610
 edges to not pass me and ride over 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.349
 Cuticle and now would put the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.660
 lamp for two minutes but as 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.130
 this gel is exquisite and do not see me I'm going 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.270
 to do the same in the other four 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.080
 fingers of almada and I put the hand 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.360
 directly whole in the lamp a 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.900
 time out of the lamp without cleaning 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.170
 we return to give another capita the capitas 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.050
 they have to be very finite not 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.940
 they have to be a chubby cloak or nothing 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.640
 as if we were painting with a 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.920
 enamel and I with these gels as they are 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.090
 so thick 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.280
 I would recommend special care in the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.980
 cuticle because at 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.130
 when sweeping it seems like the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.420
 cuticle as the little color blurred 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.220
 so we put a little bit of attention 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.400
 there is so that you have it right so that 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.790
 look beautiful once we have the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.340
 two little hands given the same color as 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.660
 the previous hand I give the captain all the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.620
 hand puts back in the lamp 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.620
 for two minutes 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.480
 now with the transparent gel we are going to 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.180
 build the nail and in this case I have not 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.739
 cleaned but hey you could clean the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.739
 nail and nothing would happen 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.590
 when we are going to have I'm putting the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.349
 These lamp and I getting a 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.659
 in one or at most two by two but 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.550
 better so that we can not think of a 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:58.229
 in one and we alternate a little finger of 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.300
 one hand a little finger from the other when 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.110
 we take out of the lamp we clean with a 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.750
 gauze and alcohol 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.000
 and with a fine grain limit I'm going to 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.000
 file the sides and the surface 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.760
 another pretty animated polished and invites you 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:46.070
 we finally put our top coat 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.730
 and we put it back in the lamp during 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.730
 two minutes 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.500
 when we already take out the lamp and 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.789
 we have to put a little bit of 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.789
 cuticle oil 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.500
 and good this you when there is no 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.160
 that drying it does not leave a sticky cap 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.990
 and well then that would be the manicure 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.880
 now I will leave you a little photo I hope that you 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.710
 I liked it 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.480
 I hope that you have solved some doubt and we 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.480
 we see in the next video bye bye
