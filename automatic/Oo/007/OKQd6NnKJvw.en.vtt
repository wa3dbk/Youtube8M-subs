00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
this part is here a section that often -

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.539 
this part is here a section that often -
mmm<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.850> big<00:01:15.090> chunks<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> across<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
mmm for big chunks so across this way I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.840 
mmm for big chunks so across this way I
like<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> looks<00:01:18.509> better<00:01:18.810> parted

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
like the way it looks better parted

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.820 
like the way it looks better parted
diagonally<00:01:20.850> than<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.530> straight<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
diagonally than I do straight up and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
diagonally than I do straight up and
down<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.850> parted<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.479> big<00:01:24.720> chunks

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
down so I just parted for big chunks

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
down so I just parted for big chunks
diagonally<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> came<00:01:25.799> across<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.670> came

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
diagonally I came across this way came

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.670 
diagonally I came across this way came
across<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.049> way<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:30.530> started<00:01:31.530> taking

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
across this way and just started taking

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.050 
across this way and just started taking
out<00:01:31.950> sections<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.520> curly

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
out sections from there to get the curly

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.920 
out sections from there to get the curly
look<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> now<00:01:37.340> what<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> did<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.930> bad

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
look like it is now what I did was bad

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.569 
look like it is now what I did was bad
to<00:01:40.140> knot<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.130> haven't<00:01:41.400> seen<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to knot it and if you haven't seen a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.480 
to knot it and if you haven't seen a
bantu<00:01:42.000> knot<00:01:42.180> before<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.140> doing<00:01:43.619> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
bantu knot before all you're doing is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.999 
bantu knot before all you're doing is
twisting<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> hair<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:49.350> rolling<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> up

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
twisting the hair and just rolling it up

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.660 
twisting the hair and just rolling it up
that<00:01:50.250> way

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that way

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.179 
that way
they<00:01:50.909> weren't<00:01:51.180> quite<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.810> small<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.590> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
they weren't quite that small I think I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.160 
they weren't quite that small I think I
did<00:01:54.229> maybe<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.920> 8<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.490> 10<00:01:56.700> grand

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170
