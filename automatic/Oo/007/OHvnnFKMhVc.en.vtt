five<00:03:26.640> formulas<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.989> when<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.920> applied<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.430> did

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
five formulas so when I applied it I did

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.729 
five formulas so when I applied it I did
you<00:03:29.820> know<00:03:29.940> two<00:03:30.209> or<00:03:30.299> three<00:03:30.329> layers<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.440> quite

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
you know two or three layers it is quite

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.410 
you know two or three layers it is quite
a<00:03:31.769> flattering<00:03:32.220> formula<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.880> lips<00:03:33.090> because

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
a flattering formula on the lips because

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.940 
a flattering formula on the lips because
it<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> lot<00:03:33.870> more<00:03:33.900> silky<00:03:34.530> than<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.799> other

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
it is a lot more silky than the other

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.110 
it is a lot more silky than the other
five<00:03:35.250> formulas

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
five formulas

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.500 
five formulas
it<00:03:36.390> doesn't<00:03:36.930> emphasize<00:03:37.440> any<00:03:38.010> dry<00:03:38.489> bits<00:03:39.060> all

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
it doesn't emphasize any dry bits all

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.360 
it doesn't emphasize any dry bits all
the<00:03:39.780> fine<00:03:39.959> lines<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.470> my<00:03:40.620> lips<00:03:40.859> so<00:03:41.100> it's<00:03:41.280> a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
the fine lines and my lips so it's a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.550 
the fine lines and my lips so it's a
very<00:03:41.549> flattering<00:03:41.880> formula<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.320> very

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
very flattering formula but it is very

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.440 
very flattering formula but it is very
sheer<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.280> find<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.730> this<00:03:44.850> one<00:03:45.060> wears<00:03:45.269> off

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
sheer I find it this one wears off

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.390 
sheer I find it this one wears off
really<00:03:45.750> quickly<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.769> you're<00:03:46.950> eating<00:03:47.280> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
really quickly and if you're eating and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.370 
really quickly and if you're eating and

use<00:05:13.300> which<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:19.080> but<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.169> find<00:05:20.440> this<00:05:20.500> one<00:05:20.680> really

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
use which is but I find this one really

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.620 
use which is but I find this one really
lovely<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.430> wearable<00:05:21.940> it's<00:05:22.180> really

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
lovely and wearable it's really

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.540 
lovely and wearable it's really
flattering<00:05:22.930> on<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.650> lips<00:05:23.890> it<00:05:24.490> doesn't

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
flattering on the lips it doesn't

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.690 
flattering on the lips it doesn't
emphasize<00:05:25.000> dry<00:05:25.780> lines<00:05:26.020> or<00:05:26.410> flaky<00:05:26.919> skin<00:05:27.220> but<00:05:27.610> it

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
emphasize dry lines or flaky skin but it

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.330 
emphasize dry lines or flaky skin but it
has<00:05:27.880> got<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.120> sheer<00:05:28.570> formula<00:05:29.260> just<00:05:29.290> like<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:30.160> how

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
has got a sheer formula just like on how

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.070 
has got a sheer formula just like on how
to<00:05:30.400> pink<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:31.030> don't<00:05:31.330> mind<00:05:31.540> this<00:05:31.660> shear<00:05:31.870> formula

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
to pink I don't mind this shear formula

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.630 
to pink I don't mind this shear formula
for<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.620> color<00:05:32.860> because<00:05:33.040> it<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:33.310> such<00:05:33.610> a

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
for this color because it is such a

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.969 
for this color because it is such a
different<00:05:34.030> color<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.479> my<00:05:34.660> lips<00:05:34.690> that<00:05:35.229> it<00:05:35.710> shows

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
different color to my lips that it shows

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.550 
different color to my lips that it shows
up<00:05:36.190> anyway<00:05:36.580> but<00:05:37.330> just<00:05:37.660> like<00:05:37.810> on<00:05:37.960> Hertz<00:05:38.169> pink<00:05:38.440> as

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
up anyway but just like on Hertz pink as

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.230 
up anyway but just like on Hertz pink as
well<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.979> doesn't<00:05:39.250> last<00:05:39.400> very<00:05:39.550> long<00:05:39.910> through

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
well it doesn't last very long through

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.730 
well it doesn't last very long through
drinking<00:05:40.510> or<00:05:40.780> eating<00:05:40.900> so<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.350> do<00:05:41.470> need<00:05:41.620> to

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
drinking or eating so you do need to

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.950 
drinking or eating so you do need to
touch<00:05:41.919> up<00:05:41.950> otherwise<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:42.669> do<00:05:42.820> tend<00:05:43.060> to<00:05:43.150> get<00:05:43.360> at

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
touch up otherwise you do tend to get at

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.170 
touch up otherwise you do tend to get at
the<00:05:44.229> color<00:05:44.470> being<00:05:45.460> pushed<00:05:45.789> towards<00:05:46.090> the

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
the color being pushed towards the

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.610 
the color being pushed towards the
outside<00:05:46.539> of<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.720> lip<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:46.960> then<00:05:47.200> you<00:05:47.320> have<00:05:47.440> no

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
outside of the lip and then you have no

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.050 
outside of the lip and then you have no
color<00:05:47.890> in<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.160> center<00:05:48.520> of<00:05:48.550> your<00:05:48.700> lips<00:05:48.910> and

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
color in the center of your lips and

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.210 
color in the center of your lips and
since<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.360> is<00:05:49.450> a<00:05:49.479> purple<00:05:49.930> color<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:50.770> is<00:05:50.950> quite

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
since it is a purple color it is quite

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.029 
since it is a purple color it is quite
obvious<00:05:51.400> if<00:05:52.030> that<00:05:52.300> happens<00:05:52.690> I<00:05:53.080> do<00:05:53.590> have<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.860> say

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
obvious if that happens I do have to say

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.980 
obvious if that happens I do have to say
though<00:05:54.190> that<00:05:54.220> releve<00:05:54.789> purple<00:05:55.150> is<00:05:55.330> probably<00:05:55.810> my

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
though that releve purple is probably my

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.490 
though that releve purple is probably my
favorite<00:05:56.650> out<00:05:56.979> of<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.220> five<00:05:57.430> colors<00:05:58.030> I'm

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
favorite out of the five colors I'm

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.460 
favorite out of the five colors I'm
sickened<00:05:59.500> to<00:06:00.090> arabesque<00:06:01.090> rosy<00:06:01.810> which<00:06:02.200> I

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
sickened to arabesque rosy which I

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.900 
sickened to arabesque rosy which I
really<00:06:02.860> love<00:06:03.039> as<00:06:03.190> well<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.370> think<00:06:03.520> I'm<00:06:03.760> gonna

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
really love as well I think I'm gonna

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.820 
really love as well I think I'm gonna
get<00:06:04.090> so<00:06:04.330> much<00:06:04.450> wear<00:06:04.690> out<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.900> them<00:06:05.140> but<00:06:05.710> I<00:06:05.770> think

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
get so much wear out of them but I think

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.100 
get so much wear out of them but I think
all<00:06:06.190> five<00:06:06.520> colors<00:06:06.940> are<00:06:07.510> actually<00:06:07.930> really

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
all five colors are actually really

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.010 
all five colors are actually really
lovely<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:09.460> only<00:06:09.850> colors<00:06:10.570> that<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.780> probably

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
lovely the only colors that I probably

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.540 
lovely the only colors that I probably
wouldn't<00:06:11.320> purchase<00:06:11.620> again<00:06:12.100> if<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.400> had<00:06:12.520> the

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
wouldn't purchase again if I had the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.719 
wouldn't purchase again if I had the
choice<00:06:12.820> would<00:06:13.360> be<00:06:13.390> a<00:06:13.780> shirt<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.140> pink<00:06:14.440> and<00:06:14.740> point

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
choice would be a shirt a pink and point

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.180 
choice would be a shirt a pink and point
to<00:06:15.820> Carl<00:06:16.090> mostly<00:06:17.020> because<00:06:17.380> those<00:06:17.620> two<00:06:17.919> have

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
to Carl mostly because those two have

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.600 
to Carl mostly because those two have
the<00:06:18.729> most<00:06:19.539> unflattering<00:06:20.169> formula<00:06:20.919> for<00:06:21.310> lips

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
the most unflattering formula for lips

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.300 
the most unflattering formula for lips
that<00:06:21.850> are<00:06:22.000> not<00:06:22.240> perfect<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:23.169> I<00:06:23.860> know<00:06:23.919> there

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
that are not perfect and I know there

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.140 
that are not perfect and I know there
are<00:06:24.400> some<00:06:24.580> people<00:06:24.729> that<00:06:24.910> have<00:06:25.120> really

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
are some people that have really

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.460 
are some people that have really
gorgeous<00:06:25.630> lips<00:06:26.020> that

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
gorgeous lips that

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.520 
gorgeous lips that
need<00:06:26.710> any<00:06:26.980> care<00:06:27.850> at<00:06:27.880> all<00:06:28.180> but<00:06:29.110> mine<00:06:29.320> are<00:06:29.500> not

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
need any care at all but mine are not

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.520 
need any care at all but mine are not
like<00:06:29.800> that<00:06:30.070> so<00:06:30.490> those<00:06:31.480> two<00:06:31.840> colors<00:06:32.170> do

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
like that so those two colors do

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.810 
like that so those two colors do
emphasize<00:06:33.870> gross<00:06:34.870> lips<00:06:35.610> basically<00:06:36.610> and

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
emphasize gross lips basically and

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.700 
emphasize gross lips basically and
that's<00:06:36.940> why<00:06:37.210> I<00:06:37.270> don't<00:06:37.420> like<00:06:37.720> them<00:06:37.870> as<00:06:38.050> much<00:06:38.080> as

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
that's why I don't like them as much as

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.680 
that's why I don't like them as much as
the<00:06:38.830> other<00:06:38.980> three<00:06:39.190> colors<00:06:39.580> but<00:06:40.240> I<00:06:40.300> think<00:06:40.570> the

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
the other three colors but I think the

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.420 
the other three colors but I think the
colors<00:06:41.020> are<00:06:41.050> really<00:06:41.500> beautiful<00:06:41.980> they<00:06:42.310> go

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
colors are really beautiful they go

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.460 
colors are really beautiful they go
really<00:06:42.700> nicely<00:06:42.910> with<00:06:43.060> pale<00:06:43.390> skin<00:06:43.420> but<00:06:44.350> it

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
really nicely with pale skin but it

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.530 
really nicely with pale skin but it
depends<00:06:44.860> if<00:06:44.980> you<00:06:45.130> like<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.580> pestle<00:06:46.120> lip<00:06:46.360> you'll

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
depends if you like a pestle lip you'll
