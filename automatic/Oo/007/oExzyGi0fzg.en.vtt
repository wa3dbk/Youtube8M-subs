00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.140
 very first recipe that is applied in 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.370
 local and this I do because martita 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.370
 there would be more money 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.270
 today on Mars the truth is that we 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.760

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.710
 so you love this 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.870
 and today especially we are going to make a 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.000
 super healthy because we're going to do 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.460
 nothing that has dry onions 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.410
 chopped chive a little mushroom 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.570
 which is going to be the protein that has been 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.160
 ported already in filetito also a little 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.370
 of tomato that we cut the ice cube 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.500
 such that they are cut into cubes 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.770
 boiled and drained plus a little bit of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.410
 consume vegetables chilitos of these 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.570
 some chilitos retinues those that you 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.460
 want because I know that she cry 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.350
 he put a stalk hours because he wants 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.729
 your Havanans true emirates and a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.010
 little salt and pepper parsley and with 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.140
 this we already have to make a delicious 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.290
 I find it lovely, wonderful mind 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 and also what you're going to do to me 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.750
 I imagined what happens 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.960
 for this recipe there is no need because 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.880
 there is no need for oil normally 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 if you would need to put oil on it but 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.710
 as we need as those who are 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.930
 common the initials of nothing processes 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.690
 well then but here we do not have 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 spare parts no no then let's put 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.990
 here a little onion I'm going to leave 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.190
 brown 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.550
 like me the one that I come from very golden not 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.940
 good yellow we are going to put to brown 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.060
 and this one 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.710
 sorry and we are going to add the shopping 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.480
 mushroom that can be any type 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.660
 of fungus because in Mexico we have 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.620
 very many can be a line from a 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.100
 crimini up to and through these this 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.300
 claritos concept could be an abortion 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.300
 fast 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.220
 because it is not no 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.220
 quiet and things like that 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:19.960
 and then I put a little salt Martin 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:23.380
 so this is so 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.020
 and how is it that nothing else has to see it 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
 do not stick anything look, look, look, look 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.380
 Behold 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.550
 without having to put the spatula 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.050
 in order to have 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.660
 well I will add tomato 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.340
 and the nopalitos 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.370
 what is it about now is good at the time 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.090
 boil the nopales do 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.090
 with the letter of the green tomato for 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.430
 that provide life and also 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.760
 can do with the phoenix with a little 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.110
 of copper then it is difficult to find 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.800
 you know copper things then then 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.340
 the Phoenix have copper and with that and if 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.080
 you can not get Elvira weeping, not that 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.080
 how he gets the copper out the truth 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.840
 they are smelling him but he comes back from vision or 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.650
 clear and I'll put a little bit of 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.220
 be and pepper 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.699
 here also so little and I'm going to 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.710
 put the chilies this is with final end 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.940
 it is this and through that he caught a 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.150
 little time to take it and we're going 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.449
 to put the consommé and you gave me pita 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.509
 true truth account and all of us 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.720
 they are seeing in little house they know they know 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.729
 who believes this has no equal because 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.710
 martita, look what they are made 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.729
 precisely with the most advanced in 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.729
 technology and this is very important that 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.560
 emphasize it are facts of this edge 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.680
 non-stick parent no no no no 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.960
 non-stick sapphire and this means 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.660
 that they will be able to cook any type 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.389
 of saucer without using 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.670
 fats nothing any kind of fats and their 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.090
 so the food is not going to stick I do not know 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.220
 do not stick it is very easy to wash and the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.010
 truth is that it is very easy to change 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.290
 eating habits with the cane 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.300
 because of Boston it allows you to leave a 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.460
 side the fat and keep eating the 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.550
 saucers that you like martita and you know 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.860
 that rediscover the taste of food and 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.540
 that's also basic and then you have a 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.240
 capacity with ductor to have someone 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.920
 hot evenly very fast and 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.160
 big that they're going to save this is the 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.020
 word that has come to join they go to 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.180
 save time because cooking everything 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.950
 very fast they will save in effort by 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.960
 what we already said will save on water 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.290
 and in heat you clean up your profile 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.060
 war how much wave because there are many 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.030
 people need to say 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.910
 hijole this is like this or not when saying papyri 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.380
 be so intimate they highlighted seven 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.410
 adherent aspirants but they are not 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.910
 sapphire we're thinking you do not know that 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.700
 about all the wonders that the 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.030
 flavor stone is so for the price 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.169
 that is nothing and believe me is nothing 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.190
 The only thing they have to do is mark the 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.889
 number that appears on the screen called 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.630
 completely free and give this battery of 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.730
 kitchen concur in everything that 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.040
 we are saying savings saving a thousand 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.690
 percent because they are going to take it look 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.130
 they are going to take what is the pan to 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.840
 sauté the deep frying pan and cover 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.790
 tempered glass but if you mark inside 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.270
 the next half hour we are going to give you 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.310
 gift buying your pans there is a 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.919
 huge pan with which to fill us 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.570
 for the whole family and also a 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.190
 recipe book with recipes to suck the 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.380
 fingers the best is the thing is not left 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.780
 because we love it if we always 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.020
 give them more more more general I love 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.820
 what do you think about the 50 people 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.740
 in marking what they already have their flavor 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:09.350
 this takes away the gifts that I already said and 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.350
 they take five knives play see this 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.029
 but never those who are going to have knives 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.529
 for life better and they're also going to 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.990
 have sanctions for life because there are 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.240
 Lifetime guarantee I'm going to give you a 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.249
 advice call the hard ones that appear 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.129
 on the screen bring their flavor stone 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:31.800
 take the knives and run 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.800
 to the notary, he arranges his inheritance because 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:38.439
 inherited my island 

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:39.969
 my knives also because they know that 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.189
 they are stuck any food you are 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:44.949
 annoyed we returned their money or they 

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:49.650
 we give new ones that this offers us 

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.650
 they just are not sure of the quality 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.520
 and besides that it takes our sopita 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:59.270
 hear a little lemon like that in half 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.840
 parsley 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.840
 wants 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:10.510
 wait for me, we go back in what I 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.510
 love

 here
