the surrounding nations now first of all
we<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> remember<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> was

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
we need to remember that that was

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
we need to remember that that was
already<00:00:43.829> forbidden<00:00:44.460> by<00:00:44.640> God<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.539> were

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
surrounding nations so by taking wives

surrounding nations so by taking wives
they<00:00:51.180> were<00:00:51.210> already<00:00:51.809> rejecting<00:00:52.649> God's<00:00:52.890> way

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they were already rejecting God's way

and choosing to take life into their own

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.130 
and choosing to take life into their own
hands<00:00:55.980> secondly<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.449> need<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> remember<00:00:58.020> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hands secondly we need to remember that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.380 
hands secondly we need to remember that
God<00:00:58.199> does<00:00:58.680> indeed<00:00:59.010> hate<00:00:59.309> divorce<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.940> Malachi

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
2:16 we know that God says I hate

2:16 we know that God says I hate
divorce<00:01:03.120> he<00:01:03.809> doesn't<00:01:04.260> hate<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> divorce<00:01:05.189> II

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
divorce he doesn't hate the divorce II

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.270 
divorce he doesn't hate the divorce II
he<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.360> hates<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.960> divorce<00:01:07.260> causes<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
he just hates what divorce causes so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
he just hates what divorce causes so
it's<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.850> God<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.330> excited<00:01:10.170> about<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's not like God was excited about this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's not like God was excited about this
mass<00:01:11.450> divorce<00:01:12.450> opportunity<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> Jewish

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
mass divorce opportunity for the Jewish

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.170 
mass divorce opportunity for the Jewish
people<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.640> 3rd<00:01:15.530> 2nd<00:01:16.530> ayah<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
people here 3rd 2nd ayah you know in

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719 
people here 3rd 2nd ayah you know in
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> Ezra<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.710> could<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.100> been<00:01:20.400> wrong

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to Ezra he could have been wrong

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
going to Ezra he could have been wrong
maybe<00:01:21.150> Ezra<00:01:21.600> should<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.200> avoided<00:01:22.470> his

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
maybe Ezra should have avoided his

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.490 
maybe Ezra should have avoided his
advice<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> Bible<00:01:24.360> doesn't<00:01:24.509> say<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
advice now the Bible doesn't say that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.390 
advice now the Bible doesn't say that
but<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.189> plausible<00:01:26.900> fourth<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.130> look

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
but it's plausible fourth when we look

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.819 
but it's plausible fourth when we look
at<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.729> moment<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.600> divorce<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
at this moment of divorce where the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
at this moment of divorce where the
Jewish<00:01:32.159> men<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.610> indeed<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> divorce

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Jewish men do indeed go and divorce

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.350 
Jewish men do indeed go and divorce
their<00:01:34.170> women<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> realize<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
their women we need to realize that the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.920 
their women we need to realize that the
situation<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.350> perhaps<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.189> dire<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.240> had

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
situation was perhaps so dire that had

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
situation was perhaps so dire that had
this<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.439> taken<00:01:40.920> place<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.759> Jewish<00:01:42.150> nation

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this not taken place the Jewish nation

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
this not taken place the Jewish nation
would<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.780> lost<00:01:43.049> their<00:01:43.380> identity<00:01:43.500> all

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
would have lost their identity all

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.870 
would have lost their identity all
together<00:01:44.960> not<00:01:45.960> only<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.530> when<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> Jewish

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
together not only that when the Jewish

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
together not only that when the Jewish
men<00:01:48.119> would<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.420> went<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> their<00:01:48.930> wives<00:01:49.110> they

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
men would have went to their wives they

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.490 
men would have went to their wives they
could<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.979> adopted<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.420> Jewish<00:01:51.840> beliefs<00:01:52.290> as

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
could have adopted the Jewish beliefs as

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.700 
could have adopted the Jewish beliefs as
well<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:54.119> didn't<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> walk<00:01:55.140> away<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
well so they didn't have to walk away in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.730 
well so they didn't have to walk away in
this<00:01:55.860> kind<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:57.420> finally<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.350> would

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this kind of way then finally I would

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
this kind of way then finally I would
want<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> say<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.149> though<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.689> Bible

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
want to say that though the Bible

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.499 
want to say that though the Bible
doesn't<00:02:01.439> give<00:02:01.860> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> exit<00:02:02.969> plan<00:02:03.180> what

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
doesn't give kind of the exit plan what

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.889 
doesn't give kind of the exit plan what
happened<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> women<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.890> were<00:02:05.159> going

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
happened of the women that were going

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.520 
happened of the women that were going
away<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> children

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
away with the children

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.950 
away with the children
we<00:02:09.010> can<00:02:09.220> hopefully<00:02:09.550> assume<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.780> these

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
we can hopefully assume that these

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.830 
we can hopefully assume that these
Jewish<00:02:11.350> men<00:02:11.650> would<00:02:12.340> have<00:02:12.370> taken<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.450> care<00:02:13.510> of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
Jewish men would have taken good care of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.230 
Jewish men would have taken good care of
them<00:02:14.080> sending<00:02:14.500> them<00:02:14.560> off<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.340> provisions<00:02:16.030> if

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
them sending them off with provisions if

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.390 
them sending them off with provisions if
not<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.140> would<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.530> think<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.040> would<00:02:18.280> think

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
not I would have think I would think

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.790 
not I would have think I would think
that<00:02:18.520> they<00:02:18.700> failed<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.180> an<00:02:19.330> abysmal<00:02:19.630> way<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.740> it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
that they failed in an abysmal way so it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.120 
that they failed in an abysmal way so it
appears<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.520> was<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.820> one-time

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
appears that this was a one-time

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730 
appears that this was a one-time
leniency<00:02:24.130> act<00:02:24.370> whereby<00:02:25.030> God<00:02:25.500> permitted<00:02:26.500> for

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
leniency act whereby God permitted for

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.010 
leniency act whereby God permitted for
this<00:02:27.010> divorce<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.610> take<00:02:27.970> place<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.450> spare<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
this divorce to take place to spare the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.800 
this divorce to take place to spare the
Jewish<00:02:29.350> nation<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:30.820> keep<00:02:31.210> in<00:02:31.390> mind<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
Jewish nation but we keep in mind that

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.280 
Jewish nation but we keep in mind that
God<00:02:32.050> does<00:02:32.380> indeed<00:02:32.740> hate<00:02:33.340> divorce<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
God does indeed hate divorce not the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.010 
God does indeed hate divorce not the
divorcee<00:02:35.740> but<00:02:36.340> what<00:02:36.910> divorce<00:02:37.210> causes<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
divorcee but what divorce causes to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.390 
divorcee but what divorce causes to
those<00:02:38.230> who<00:02:38.410> experience<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.459
