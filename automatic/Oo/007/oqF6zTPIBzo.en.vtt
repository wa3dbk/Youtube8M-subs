00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.620
 Burning kokott tasting d 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.840
 to make this delicious coconut cake 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.960
 We are going to need a milk can 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.809
 condensed a coconut envelope of 125 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.299
 grams a tub of cream cheese 2 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.880
 eggs a little margarine to spread 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.800
 the container and chocolate syrup for 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.560
 I've done decorating ingredients 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.220
 light so it's not so heavy and have 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 Less fat 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.890
 we started with the cheese 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.890
 and we put it in a bowl 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.079
 and we add the condensed milk 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.210
 we stir a little until more or less 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.210
 that give a uniform mass 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.810
 we add the eggs and remove a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810
 a little more 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 now we will add the coconut 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:30.690
 I go back to remove everything a little until 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.690
 now like this until it's completely 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.759
 uniform 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.289
 It was a container 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.409
 we put the margarine so that we are not 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:48.130
 paste I used the silicone because 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.130
 I'm doing very well and nothing sticks 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.860
 now we add 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.860
 mix 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.620
 and we are preheating the oven 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.620
 at 180 degrees 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.939
 and we heat it up and over 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.939
 down about 25 minutes 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.819
 and now we only have to put it in the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.819
 plate 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.900
 Oh that I burn there that falls out 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.130

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.500
