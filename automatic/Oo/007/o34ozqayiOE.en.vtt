00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.740
 here we are one more day in the worst channel 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.690
 history until today don 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.480
 you take gamer they bring a story 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.629
 very anecdotal I had heard about 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.789
 of her but never so extended and never 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.090
 I had known the explanation and why 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.700
 and after reading this article and many 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.130
 thanks to pixel lux for leaving it to me 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.050
 today I decided to make this video myself 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.410
 I'm just going to read it now 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.970
 give my voice is not my opinion I'm going to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.030
 read in the first person as is 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.280
 written because he considered that a lot 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.130
 people would miss it and it seems very 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.080
 interesting just like I did not know that 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.450
 for sure what it was about 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.370
 other people may not know and 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.980
 surely the piece this video what 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.129
 you are going to know it is about the song of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.930
 tota ko tota cason and I do not want you 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.750
 entertain more let's go with reading 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.840
 I hope everyone likes it and that 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 I think it's as interesting as me 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.110
 all right 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 many know what is an interest or 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 better said easter egg in the world 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.729
 of video games but for those who do not 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.790
 know 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.070
 I facilitate what is an interest is a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.200
 message a hidden file that can 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.630
 be introduced a video game dvds 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 cds and computer programs are usually 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.619
 be left in the world video gameplay 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.420
 intentionally so that the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.119
 players find it while they play 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.830
 and they are not usually easy to find 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.690
 because I tell you this because this 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.939
 article goes about one of the interests 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.039
 of nintendo most famous even though 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.569
 there are many people who do not know did 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.700
 time I wanted to talk about it in 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.310
 an article but I knew it would have me 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.009
 to document thoroughly and that's done this 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 story begins with kazumi tot here one 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.810
 of the most important composers of 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.580
 the big n with permission from the great coach with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.039
 do since it is the culprit of the band 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.470
 soundtrack of super smash bros brawl mario 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.659
 paint and the saga with pre-complete 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.220
 animal crossing is also remarkable 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.289
 write down who is the dubbing actor 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.009
 original of the most charismatic dinosaur 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.170
 from nintendo 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.810
 josh and so his voice is more to us 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.940
 how familiar this Japanese made a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.580
 melody only 19 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.980
 what he called tot here are the song of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.200
 dot here in order to leave your mark your 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.319
 personal brand in each and every one of 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.120
 the games in which he had participated 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.650
 here we have this man kazuma to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.650
 taca or should we say yes 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 has been confirmed its appearance in a 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.510
 list of about 20 games where they are 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.150
 including luigi's mansion doctor mario 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.010
 paint coming 2 animal crossing la 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.340
 most of the saga the games 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.840
 legend of zelda link's awakening super 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.819
 mario 26 golden coins yossi story super 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.530
 smash bros brawl has not been confirmed 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.930
 but to this day it continues 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 looking for the melody and until recently in 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.069
 wii sports have any of these games 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.019
 and you have not heard the song did not excuse 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.670
 in some games it is difficult to 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.989
 find or have to do numerous 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.579
 combinations for you to come out though 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.920
 the trick in many games like me its 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.269
 history fled and mansion is in wait 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.430
 a lot of time on a screen in 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.590
 specific and the easter ex will come out as 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.970
 magically down I put a 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.190
 YouTube link so you can 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.470
 listen to this peculiar melody 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.329
 a curiosity to add is that here his death 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.519
 he is here he likes to leave his mark so much 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.079
 staff in his works that not happy 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.030
 with including his hidden song in many 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.739
 games in animal crossing there is a 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.629
 adorable puppy made to his image and 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.299
 similarity and also with a name 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.640
 suspiciously very similar to yours 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.430
 tota what 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.440
 the animal crossing statut attack that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.380
 approach him in animal crossing and 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.700
 listen tot here they are to me has always 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.069
 pleased to investigate the secrets that 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.240
 hide videogames that you do not scream and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.800
 I found this enough 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.990
 curious to share it with 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.520
 You, I, for my part, am going to 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.260
 dust off some games that I have of 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.030
 those cited to find that song to 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.160
 Although I have seen on youtube 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.270
 like to figure things out by myself and 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.730
 I'm sure that you too 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.350

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 compilation video I'll leave it to me 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.350
 I also tell you what I have described 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.910
 read in first person I'm not a 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.800
 woman as you can denote by my voice and 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.120
 those who know my channel you already know 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.760
 it's something very curious like a man and 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.680
 creator of such good melodies and the one that 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.810
 gives the voice the voice to God and 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.940
 has decided to leave its mark on so many 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.560
 video games so hiddenly I 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.350
 been watching some of some of the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.330
 videos and do truth you have to do 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.039
 true follies especially in the one of 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.229
 wii sports you have to lose at least 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.889
 half an hour to get to hear the 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:38.490
 19 notes of the song and of course 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.770
 it would not be normal if you had not 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.449
 listened to the song but the song that 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.969
 It was playing in the background for those who did not 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.620
 you knew it was tota cason so nothing 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.999

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.520
