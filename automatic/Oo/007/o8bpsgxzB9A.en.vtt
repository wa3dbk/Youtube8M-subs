the<00:00:31.000> most<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.540> palm<00:00:32.500> slider<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:34.120> can<00:00:34.180> see

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
the most the palm slider you can see

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.030 
the most the palm slider you can see
it's<00:00:34.540> got<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.750> bit<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.140> an<00:00:35.230> L<00:00:35.410> shape<00:00:35.770> here

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
it's got a bit of an L shape here

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's got a bit of an L shape here
essentially<00:00:36.850> what<00:00:37.120> we<00:00:37.210> have<00:00:37.240> is<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.630> plastic

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
essentially what we have is a plastic

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.960 
essentially what we have is a plastic
palm<00:00:38.740> slider<00:00:39.100> it's<00:00:39.340> got<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.490> little<00:00:39.790> bit<00:00:39.910> of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
palm slider it's got a little bit of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.730 
palm slider it's got a little bit of
flex<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.330> it<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.630> keep<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.930> glove<00:00:41.170> comfortable

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.850 
flex to it to keep the glove comfortable
the<00:00:42.700> thought<00:00:42.970> behind<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:43.720> really<00:00:44.200> simple

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
the thought behind this is really simple

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.550 
the thought behind this is really simple
most<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.730> us<00:00:45.850> only<00:00:46.060> fall<00:00:46.960> we're<00:00:47.170> going<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.350> put

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
most of us only fall we're going to put

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.130 
most of us only fall we're going to put
our<00:00:47.650> hands<00:00:48.070> out<00:00:48.220> to<00:00:48.460> brace<00:00:48.670> our<00:00:48.910> impact<00:00:49.330> with<00:00:50.110> a

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
our hands out to brace our impact with a

standard glove using a leather palm a
few<00:00:52.720> different<00:00:53.020> things<00:00:53.200> can<00:00:53.500> possibly<00:00:54.070> happen

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
few different things can possibly happen

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.180

the<00:00:55.120> leather<00:00:55.360> grab<00:00:55.840> pavement<00:00:56.530> right<00:00:56.710> because

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
the leather grab pavement right because

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.650 
the leather grab pavement right because
it<00:00:57.310> doesn't<00:00:57.579> slide<00:00:57.820> as<00:00:58.030> easily<00:00:58.210> as<00:00:58.540> the

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
it doesn't slide as easily as the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.319 
it doesn't slide as easily as the
plastic<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.980> can<00:01:00.160> transfer<00:01:00.670> energy<00:01:00.850> into<00:01:01.210> your

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
plastic it can transfer energy into your

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.170 
plastic it can transfer energy into your
wrist<00:01:01.570> elbow<00:01:02.079> shoulder<00:01:02.110> create<00:01:03.010> injury<00:01:03.430> it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
wrist elbow shoulder create injury it

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.880 
wrist elbow shoulder create injury it
can<00:01:04.360> grab<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.750> pavement<00:01:05.229> send<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.590> tumbling

can grab the pavement send you tumbling

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.149 
can grab the pavement send you tumbling
that's<00:01:06.490> not<00:01:06.700> fun<00:01:06.970> or<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:08.079> can<00:01:08.290> pull<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.890> seams

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
that's not fun or it can pull the seams

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.249 
that's not fun or it can pull the seams
on<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.429> glove<00:01:09.670> apart<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.299> then<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.869> have<00:01:11.049> your
