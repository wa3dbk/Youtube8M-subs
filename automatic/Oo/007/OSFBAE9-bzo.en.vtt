00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.259
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.420
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.640
 Nice to meet you Today's theme is 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 Here's a serve that can win in the game 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.559
 I will introduce to you how to assemble 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.000
 How do I put out videos of various serve now 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.869
 Assemble and serve in a game that suits you 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.980
 What can I win? 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.050
 Today I will introduce 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.370
 How to assemble a serve in the game Ironing is actually one 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.120
 What do you want everyone to remember today by all means 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.989
 There is a serve that my partner cut off 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.039
 When it works, please fight mainly with serving cut 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.350
 The other party does not work well 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.129
 If you do not work with your own cut 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.629
 Please fight with knuckle-based serve 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 One of the ways how this can be won in a serve match 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.770
 It becomes an important rule of iron I cut my serve like that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.479
 With lower rotation serve or cut-in roll serve 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.180
 When the other party misses or floats 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.079
 Because serving is working more and more 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.720
 It cuts with the servedon which cut it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.110
 We cut and cut off and serve 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.520
 You can advance the game in favor of Serve 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.729
 It is deployment that can go to win by serve 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.241
 It is easy for everyone to win when this has been working for a long time 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.000
 I think it will be deployed 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.759
 The opponent is stronger than you 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.210
 Or the serve will be used back in the second half 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.850
 In such cases, when serving is no longer effective 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.930
 What do you think about next? When you do so when serving doesn't work 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.909
 It is easy to hit the third ball next time 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.740
 It will be an important point so serve 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.549
 If it doesn't work, everyone's next is knuckle serve 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.880
 Emphasis was placed on the ease of hitting the third ball with a focus on serve that never cuts 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.390
 I will focus on how to assemble the serve 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.140
 When I say to serve a person who does not work for serving 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.950
 Because if you dare to say it is difficult to hit the third ball 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.950
 It gets harder and harder 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.500
 But I changed my mind right there 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.480
 If the serve doesn't work, all knuckles serve already 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.220
 A short serve with an uninterrupted serve 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.500
 If you do it mainly, you will get a ball that is easy to hit 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.390
 When it becomes ineffective to use the serving to cut first 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.530
 Focus on the third ball's easy to hit with knuckles 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.900
 If I get used to it, I will look for a while again 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.120
 Return the serve that cuts again at the important point to the subject 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.370
 Then your serving will work again 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.670
 At the same time, if I get used to it, I will do it mainly with knuckle serve 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 Round and round with a feeling of 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.650
 Even if your opponent doesn't work 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.370
 In a state where the server and the serve are working 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.510
 You can assemble it 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.840
 So by all means everyone today 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.810
 The iron rule of how to assemble this serve 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.980
 Thank you very much for remembering
