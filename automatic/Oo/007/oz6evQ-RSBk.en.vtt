and<00:03:08.590> I'm<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.540> divide<00:03:10.540> them<00:03:12.510> having<00:03:13.510> that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
and I'm going to divide them having that

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.850 
and I'm going to divide them having that
natural<00:03:13.780> split<00:03:14.380> aids<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.920> these<00:03:15.300> dividing

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.900 

there<00:03:20.860> we<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.190> them<00:03:21.340> nicely<00:03:21.580> divided<00:03:22.210> there

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
there we have them nicely divided there

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:33.750 
there we have them nicely divided there

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
give them just a figure eight just one

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.060 
give them just a figure eight just one
be<00:03:34.510> careful<00:03:34.540> because<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:35.560> mess<00:03:35.770> them<00:03:35.980> up

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
be careful because you can mess them up

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:46.040 
be careful because you can mess them up
very<00:03:36.370> easily
