think we should really be better than
what<00:04:29.530> we<00:04:29.680> are<00:04:29.770> right<00:04:30.070> now<00:04:30.250> because<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.450> Kevin

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.309 
well I thought we did a better job of
keeping<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.300> my<00:04:43.389> lame<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.900> second<00:04:44.139> half

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
keeping in my lame in the second half

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.080 
keeping in my lame in the second half
they've<00:04:44.770> got<00:04:44.979> a<00:04:45.009> lot<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.430> shots<00:04:45.669> in<00:04:45.819> the<00:04:45.880> lanes

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
they've got a lot of shots in the lanes

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.640 
they've got a lot of shots in the lanes
the<00:04:46.240> first<00:04:46.270> time<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.930> we<00:04:47.289> did<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.440> better<00:04:47.560> job

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
the first time that we did a better job

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.800 
the first time that we did a better job
keeping<00:04:47.979> up<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.340> lane<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.789> thought<00:04:49.539> we<00:04:49.630> did<00:04:49.750> a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
keeping up the lane I thought we did a

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.909 
keeping up the lane I thought we did a
better<00:04:49.960> job<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.229> rebounding<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.770> basketball

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
better job of rebounding the basketball

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.120 
better job of rebounding the basketball
then<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.910> thought<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:53.349> he's<00:04:53.620> indicated

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
then I thought we like he's indicated

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.589 
then I thought we like he's indicated
earlier<00:04:54.220> we<00:04:54.490> started<00:04:54.819> tracking<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.150> basket

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
earlier we started tracking the basket

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.809 
earlier we started tracking the basket
couldn't<00:04:56.349> always<00:04:56.470> get<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.860> get<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.639> rim

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
couldn't always get to get to the rim

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.339 
couldn't always get to get to the rim
completely<00:04:58.330> because<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.630> guys<00:04:58.780> were<00:04:59.020> kind<00:04:59.229> of

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
completely because the guys were kind of

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.650 
completely because the guys were kind of
big<00:04:59.830> and<00:04:59.860> know<00:05:00.729> a<00:05:00.759> lot<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.120> shot<00:05:01.300> blockers<00:05:01.630> in

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
big and know a lot of shot blockers in

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.659 
big and know a lot of shot blockers in
there<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.110> we<00:05:02.800> did<00:05:02.979> get<00:05:03.099> in<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.280> lane<00:05:03.400> got

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
there so we did get in the lane got

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.370 
there so we did get in the lane got
easier<00:05:03.940> shots<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.360> then<00:05:04.419> we<00:05:04.539> made<00:05:05.020> up<00:05:05.110> it<00:05:05.259> goes

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
easier shots and then we made up it goes

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.100 
easier shots and then we made up it goes
