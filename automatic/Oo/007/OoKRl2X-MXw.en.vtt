 in company f from x l750 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.560
 scourge with anti-vibrate function as you can see 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.640
 By sterilizing the box, you can understand that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.619
 this mouse is fully gaming on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.369
 front side we see an image 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 the protagonist of the splinter cell game i 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.679

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.100

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.020
 couples would sam phisher also written on inte 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.110
 chooses technology 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 and xl-750bk 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.340
 laser gaming mouse that is what mouse is 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.059
 come on, come on, we see 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 Little do you sit on the Oscar as you see in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.980
 such a golden hand needs a golden 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 mouse with the logo of the IC-7 as you see on 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.899
 most of the mouse is also the logo Dixie 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 but when we open the box now 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.720
 already in detail strictly speaking 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.430
 consider this mouse means sideways so 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.310
 Now with the rest, as you can see 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.509
 various characteristics too 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.450
 such a game style 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 here we have the mouse itself which 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.400
 diverse characteristics all 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.619
 completely in English 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:32.030
 let's open this box so 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:36.439
 branded nakleechka so but of course it 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.700
 such a hidden way was how strange 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.909
 box by the way as you can see 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 implemented very beautiful in principle but 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.250
 in fact it is quite budget 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.799
 mouse model as it is not natural 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.320
 any razer tomorrow thousands price 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.020
 given a daine mouse home is only 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.850
 850 rubles but naturally made in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.890
 China, in principle, we have everything absolutely 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.189
 rests in china even the stock 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 produced in china just more precisely 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.600
 California disclosure is going to 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 california all gather all in china 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.650
 just race 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.730
 somewhere so it's all bullshit now 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.730
 so want this by the way 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 elastic 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 so but everything seems 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.660
 I don't know if there will be any inside 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:39.110
 some kind of waste paper so not yet all the same 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:40.760
 need to hide a little bit hidden 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.970
 check here anyway anyway 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.400
 that is, until the end is not above opened here 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.100
 here since I did forget the hidden one 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.060
