and<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.270> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.230

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
broadheads fly like field point however

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.110 
broadheads fly like field point however
it's<00:00:55.560> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.160> difficult<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.820> do

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it's going to be a bit difficult to do

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.320 
it's going to be a bit difficult to do
because<00:00:58.080> I<00:00:58.470> don't<00:00:59.220> want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> ruin<00:00:59.610> my<00:00:59.880> arrows

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
because I don't want to ruin my arrows

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.750 
because I don't want to ruin my arrows
and<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> lot<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.990> with

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
and and also this is a lot to do with

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.219 
and and also this is a lot to do with
human<00:01:08.760> error<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.070> mess<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.400> up

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
human error as well so if I mess it up

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
human error as well so if I mess it up
it's<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.500> necessarily<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> broadheads<00:01:14.850> fold

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it's not necessarily the broadheads fold

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's not necessarily the broadheads fold
it<00:01:16.080> could<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.740> mindful<00:01:17.270> but<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it could just be mindful but this is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
it could just be mindful but this is
going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.350> continuous<00:01:19.590> shot<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.729> 30

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
going to be one continuous shot at 30

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.130 
going to be one continuous shot at 30
yards<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.440> camber<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.149> at<00:01:24.660> about

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
yards the camber right now is at about

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.520 
yards the camber right now is at about
10<00:01:25.710> yards<00:01:26.000> I'm<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.410> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
10 yards I'm going to do it so that you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.270 
10 yards I'm going to do it so that you
can<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> impact<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:31.009> just<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.190> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
can see the impact and just going to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.680 
can see the impact and just going to
have<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> take<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:33.030> word<00:01:33.060> time<00:01:33.630> 30<00:01:34.080> yards<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
have to take my word time 30 yards but

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.240 
have to take my word time 30 yards but
I'm<00:01:36.690> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> try<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.440> this<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.800> unbiased

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I'm going to try and do this as unbiased

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
like field points I'm just going to try

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.620 
like field points I'm just going to try
and<00:01:45.690> prove<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.080> on<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:50.369> first<00:01:50.670> shot<00:01:50.909> will<00:01:51.570> be

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and prove it on the first shot will be

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.859 
and prove it on the first shot will be
the<00:01:52.320> field<00:01:52.650> point<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.940> plane<00:01:54.240> orange<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
ok so my field point arrow is here my

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.520 
ok so my field point arrow is here my
broadhead<00:03:19.260> arrow<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.650> here<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:21.470> there<00:03:22.470> about

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
broadhead arrow is here and there about

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.740 
broadhead arrow is here and there about
a<00:03:23.370> good<00:03:24.209> two<00:03:24.480> inches<00:03:24.659> apart<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.689> said

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
a good two inches apart and like I said

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.030 
a good two inches apart and like I said
there's<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.230> lot<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.500> human<00:03:29.099> error<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.579> goal<00:03:31.040> in

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.899 
there's a lot of human error and goal in
this<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.349> this<00:03:34.349> time<00:03:34.680> I'm<00:03:35.159> going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> shoot<00:03:35.700> the

this so this time I'm going to shoot the
broadhead<00:03:36.420> first<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.230> then<00:03:38.220> I'm<00:03:38.400> going<00:03:38.519> to

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
broadhead first and then I'm going to

00:03:38.609 --> 00:04:54.910 
broadhead first and then I'm going to
shoot<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.849> feel<00:03:39.209> good

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920

now<00:04:55.920> this<00:04:56.040> has<00:04:56.220> been<00:04:56.340> one<00:04:56.550> continuous<00:04:57.180> shot

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
now this has been one continuous shot

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.670 
now this has been one continuous shot
and<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:59.460> has<00:04:59.910> been<00:05:00.270> with<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.690> same<00:05:00.930> bow<00:05:01.260> and

the same zero and you can clearly see

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.400 
the same zero and you can clearly see
that<00:05:14.150> this<00:05:15.150> time<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.870> shot<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:18.570> Magnus<00:05:19.140> head

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
that this time I shot the Magnus head

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.820 
that this time I shot the Magnus head
first<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:21.210> this<00:05:21.990> is<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.830> field<00:05:23.100> point<00:05:23.490> head

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
first and this is the field point head

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.170 
first and this is the field point head
I'm<00:05:25.830> going<00:05:25.890> to<00:05:26.310> be<00:05:26.430> honest<00:05:27.740> because<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:29.880> I

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
I'm going to be honest because this is I

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.420 
I'm going to be honest because this is I
would<00:05:30.390> say<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.600> decent<00:05:31.110> 30-yard<00:05:31.680> grouping<00:05:32.220> i

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
would say a decent 30-yard grouping i

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.090 
would say a decent 30-yard grouping i
could<00:05:33.420> probably<00:05:33.660> get<00:05:33.990> them<00:05:34.230> closer<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.740> 20

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
could probably get them closer to 20

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.630 
could probably get them closer to 20
yards<00:05:35.780> but<00:05:36.780> also<00:05:37.020> i<00:05:37.620> was<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.010> bit<00:05:38.250> reluctant

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
yards but also i was a bit reluctant

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.370 
yards but also i was a bit reluctant
when<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.090> was<00:05:39.330> shooting<00:05:39.540> the<00:05:39.750> broadhead<00:05:40.320> arrow

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
when I was shooting the broadhead arrow

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:49.060 
when I was shooting the broadhead arrow
second<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:43.340> slicing<00:05:44.340> off<00:05:44.520> my<00:05:44.790> veins<00:05:45.090> but<00:05:45.960> I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.500 

mean<00:05:50.070> you<00:05:50.700> saw<00:05:51.000> in<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:52.260> last<00:05:52.440> shot<00:05:53.060> this<00:05:54.060> arrow

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
mean you saw in the last shot this arrow

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.320 
mean you saw in the last shot this arrow
are<00:05:55.380> actually<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:55.950> arrow<00:05:56.310> hitting<00:05:57.060> this

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
are actually this arrow hitting this

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.140 
are actually this arrow hitting this
exact<00:05:57.780> same<00:05:58.050> spot<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.580> broadhead<00:06:00.090> arrow

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
exact same spot that the broadhead arrow

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.800 
exact same spot that the broadhead arrow
was<00:06:00.660> in<00:06:00.900> right<00:06:01.680> now<00:06:01.980> and<00:06:02.900> so<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:05.360> hope<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:06.420> this

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
was in right now and so I hope that this

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.740 
was in right now and so I hope that this
review<00:06:07.260> has<00:06:07.350> helped
