00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.230
 hello my name is ramón martín arévalo 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.040
 Y 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.820
 I'm 65 years old 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:34.980
 enough age to know and know what 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:39.320
 which is a log if that is your interest 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.280
 in such a way that as I have a blog and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.870
 I mean many tickets 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.370
 there is the question tab and there are many 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 the questions and it's a lot of interest 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.829
 and there are a lot of people with 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.000
 different questions 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:04.159
 I have decided to take care of the tutoring of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.060
 you for people that interest you and 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.369
 I have lived a tutorial course 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.250
 why then because that way 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 You can 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.600
 grow a law um without him dying and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.080
 that you have created it alone 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.080
 I will have enjoyed from the beginning until 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 You longest the gesture that we 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.320
 so it will be inheritance more to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.480
 your children express like a bonsai of 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.300
 fact they are used as gonzález 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.360
 so 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.240
 the course is for that so that you 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.510
 you will tell me mannequin and want not me with 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 this what you gain is an attention 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.240
 tutorial is to say a tutorial what 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.870
 difference between a book letter this 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.340
 I have here and what I can help you 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.730
 well, this book is phenomenal and that 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.140
 I recommend it 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.040
 but of course those books 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.220
 and I am a living person who is here 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.980
 you are the difference then to me 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.190
 you can ask the question you want and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.800
 what do you want and I keep saying step to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.730
 step apart from that the course consists of 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.940
 some modules are eleven modules can 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.660
 acquire a duration of two hours 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.060
 we are seeing it little by little and I 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.850
 I guarantee that you will go hand in hand 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.560
 where to buy the seeds and all the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.330
 sowing steps at any time of the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.450
 weather time winter entering is the same 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.100
 There are many topics there, well then 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.200
 that more than watering than temperature that 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.500
 fertilizers all everything you do not have to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.570
 worry just knowing that there is one thing 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.690
 that gives you the hand as if you were a 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.520
 little kid or a person who does not know and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.930
 He wants to learn 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.090
 Now I will introduce you to know I 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.170
 so you can see 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.430
 hamas what collection what I usually fear and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.640
 what 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.430
 It is true that there are many years 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.370
 I've been with them and that's why you'll see some 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.010
 that have a cable is important but 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.549
 do not despair because it is true 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.139
 also that low casualties you will have 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:46.420
 but there is always some problem 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.420
 hi the present I now 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.320

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.410

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.050

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.409
 freedom
