okay in this next hand of this out we're
taking<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> look<00:00:05.400> at<00:00:05.640> suited<00:00:06.330> connectors

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
taking a look at suited connectors

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.169 
taking a look at suited connectors
connectors<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:09.059> Gabor's<00:00:10.880> okay<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:11.940> we

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
connectors and one Gabor's okay so we

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.020 
connectors and one Gabor's okay so we
can<00:00:12.360> see<00:00:12.630> coxy<00:00:13.530> lburrows<00:00:13.950> got<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> 10-8<00:00:14.820> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
can see coxy lburrows got a 10-8 of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
can see coxy lburrows got a 10-8 of
diamonds<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.020> he's<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
diamonds I think he's going to be the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.250 
diamonds I think he's going to be the
focus<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.310> hand<00:00:17.580> which<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> 50<00:00:19.050> pence

ways<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.070> small<00:00:29.340> pairs<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.330> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
ways to small pairs in that you can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.620 
ways to small pairs in that you can
suddenly<00:00:31.470> break<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.340> crack<00:00:32.579> big<00:00:33.120> pairs<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
suddenly break and crack big pairs and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.959 
suddenly break and crack big pairs and
big<00:00:33.809> hands<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> hit<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.280> unexpected

big hands when you hit some unexpected
flops<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> flush<00:00:37.170> draw<00:00:37.200> straight<00:00:37.890> draw

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
flops like a flush draw straight draw

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.850 
flops like a flush draw straight draw
two<00:00:38.700> pairs<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.690> they're<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.739> valuable

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
two pairs and so they're really valuable

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
two pairs and so they're really valuable
hands<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.790> get<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> flops

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
hands if you can get in to see the flops

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.040 
hands if you can get in to see the flops
relatively<00:00:43.230> cheaply<00:00:44.450> yeah<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> think<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
relatively cheaply yeah and I think that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
relatively cheaply yeah and I think that
you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.890> seam<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.309> 200<00:00:47.640> big

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
you know you see the seam with 200 big

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
you know you see the seam with 200 big
blinds<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> couple<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> players<00:00:49.230> at

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
blinds here and a couple of players at

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
blinds here and a couple of players at
the<00:00:49.410> table<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> deep

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the table so you know I think the deep

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
the table so you know I think the deep
you<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.680> value<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.829> hands<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.730> suited

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you are value in hands like suited

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
you are value in hands like suited
connectors<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:55.020> goes<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
connectors really really goes up and you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.819 
connectors really really goes up and you
know<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.219> you'd<00:00:56.520> almost<00:00:56.640> rather<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.300> dealt<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
know it's you'd almost rather be dealt a

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.619 
know it's you'd almost rather be dealt a
suti<00:00:58.829> connector<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.670> small<00:00:59.940> pair<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.329> than

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
suti connector or a small pair than than

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.529 
suti connector or a small pair than than
maybe<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> big<00:01:01.410> pair<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.789> deep

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
maybe a big pair and when you get deep

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.770 
maybe a big pair and when you get deep
stacked<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.470> certainly<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
stacked as this it's certainly going to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
stacked as this it's certainly going to
the<00:01:06.780> deep<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.159> tough<00:01:08.340> EO

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the deep you get them the tough EO

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310 
the deep you get them the tough EO
decisions<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.060> could<00:01:09.360> potentially<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:10.110> with

big<00:01:10.530> pairs<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.159> hands<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.490> ace<00:01:11.700> king<00:01:12.229> post

you<00:01:22.259> arguably<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> the

you arguably want those more and the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
you arguably want those more and the
game<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.090> simpler<00:01:24.570> whereas<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.259> you're

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
game can be simpler whereas if you're

Ace King go way up in value simply

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
Ace King go way up in value simply
because<00:01:29.790> top<00:01:30.420> pair<00:01:30.659> becomes<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.380> lot<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
say 200 big blinds here and we're going

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
say 200 big blinds here and we're going
to<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> flop<00:01:37.259> we've<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.530> 10<00:01:37.770> 8<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
diamonds versus the 8 9 of cumber 110 so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
diamonds versus the 8 9 of cumber 110 so
pretty<00:01:42.119> good<00:01:42.299> flop<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.750> Copsey<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.320> he's

and<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:52.979> he's<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.610> cold

and as we can see he's going to get cold
but<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.479> was<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> million<00:01:55.560> turn

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
but I was going to be a million turn

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
but I was going to be a million turn
cards<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> he<00:01:56.610> should<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> could<00:01:57.780> barrel<00:01:58.259> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
cards that he should and could barrel on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
cards that he should and could barrel on
that<00:01:58.619> turn<00:01:58.829> including<00:01:59.369> any<00:01:59.579> diamond<00:02:00.329> of

that turn including any diamond of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810 
that turn including any diamond of
course<00:02:01.049> any<00:02:01.290> card<00:02:01.649> which<00:02:01.799> gives<00:02:02.100> him<00:02:02.219> us<00:02:02.399> which

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
course any card which gives him us which

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
course any card which gives him us which
gives<00:02:03.149> him<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> straight

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
gives him the straight

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.080 
gives him the straight
lots<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.560> over<00:02:04.860> cards<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.430> seeing<00:02:05.700> barrel

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
lots of over cards of like seeing barrel

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
lots of over cards of like seeing barrel
as<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.390> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
as well so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
as well so
I<00:02:07.799> mean<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> good<00:02:09.869> example<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
I mean it I think it's a good example of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
I mean it I think it's a good example of
how<00:02:10.259> hands<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.740> this<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.970> easier<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.120> play

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
how hands like this a easier to play

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.240 
how hands like this a easier to play

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
play interesting turn car we picked up a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
pair to go over straight draw and I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
pair to go over straight draw and I
think<00:02:31.410> two<00:02:31.830> options<00:02:32.220> are<00:02:32.370> both<00:02:32.520> fine<00:02:32.790> here<00:02:33.000> one

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
think two options are both fine here one

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.720 
think two options are both fine here one
would<00:02:33.569> just<00:02:33.600> be<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.170> bet<00:02:34.350> again<00:02:34.709> they're<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
would just be to bet again they're so

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.090 
would just be to bet again they're so
semi<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.480> value<00:02:36.989> sent<00:02:37.470> me<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> control<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
semi for value sent me to control the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.509 
semi for value sent me to control the
pot<00:02:38.520> size<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.590> almost<00:02:40.590> as<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> bluff<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.340> just

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
pot size and almost as a bluff to just

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.640 
pot size and almost as a bluff to just
fold<00:02:41.760> out<00:02:42.090> hands<00:02:42.660> which<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:42.989> decent<00:02:43.350> XE

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
fold out hands which have decent XE

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.199 
fold out hands which have decent XE
against<00:02:43.890> us<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.280> which<00:02:44.459> might<00:02:44.700> be<00:02:44.910> behind

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
against us but which might be behind

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
against us but which might be behind
such<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.140> king<00:02:46.410> queen<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
such as something like king queen and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.560 
such as something like king queen and
the<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.459> way<00:02:47.610> would<00:02:47.820> be<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.090> check<00:02:48.269> coal

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the other way would be to check coal

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.479 
the other way would be to check coal
which<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:48.930> also<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> control<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> pot

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
which is also going to control the pot

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.240 
which is also going to control the pot
size<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.420> don't<00:02:51.900> think<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.290> go<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> wrong<00:02:53.010> on

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
size so I don't think you go to wrong on

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220 
size so I don't think you go to wrong on
this<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.180> type<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.450> turn<00:02:54.720> card<00:02:55.019> with<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this on this type of turn card with the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.320 
this on this type of turn card with the
hand<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.440> we've<00:02:55.680> got<00:02:55.920> alright<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:56.970> I'd

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
hand that we've got alright I think I'd

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.880 
hand that we've got alright I think I'd
like<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.630> keep<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.019> initiative<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> hands

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
like to keep the initiative in the hands

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.740 
like to keep the initiative in the hands
like<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.280> think<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.820> quite<00:02:59.910> an<00:03:00.239> key<00:03:00.600> that

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
like I think it's quite an key that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.590 
like I think it's quite an key that
we've<00:03:00.840> got<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> 10<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.350> our<00:03:01.380> hand<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.600> less

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
we've got a 10 on our hand so less

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.449 
we've got a 10 on our hand so less
likely<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.019> our<00:03:04.140> opponents<00:03:04.560> already<00:03:05.250> made

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
likely that our opponents already made

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.860 
likely that our opponents already made
the<00:03:05.610> straight<00:03:05.880> or<00:03:06.060> not<00:03:06.090> impossible<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:06.720> less

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
the straight or not impossible but less

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.470 
the straight or not impossible but less
likely<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:08.280> think<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:08.819> we<00:03:08.910> go<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.239> check

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
likely so I think if we go for a check

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.340 
likely so I think if we go for a check
call<00:03:09.720> here<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.860> river<00:03:11.430> bricks<00:03:12.209> then<00:03:12.570> we're

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
call here and river bricks then we're

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.039 
call here and river bricks then we're
just<00:03:13.530> gonna<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.980> check<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.540> hope

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
just gonna have to check on and and hope

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:16.759 
just gonna have to check on and and hope
we're<00:03:16.230> good

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
we're good

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.160 
we're good

behind too often if he if he checks here
and<00:04:34.460> especially<00:04:34.940> given<00:04:35.300> that<00:04:35.450> cumbers<00:04:35.900> only

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290

bet<00:04:36.440> in<00:04:36.530> one<00:04:36.680> panel<00:04:36.950> verb<00:04:37.220> with<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.640> hand<00:04:37.850> like

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
bet in one panel verb with a hand like

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.940 
bet in one panel verb with a hand like
the<00:04:38.330> strongest<00:04:38.720> two<00:04:38.960> pair<00:04:39.260> he's<00:04:39.650> certainly

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
the strongest two pair he's certainly

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.170 
the strongest two pair he's certainly
checking<00:04:40.280> behind<00:04:40.520> here<00:04:40.700> so<00:04:40.820> I'd<00:04:40.940> like<00:04:41.120> to

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
checking behind here so I'd like to

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.060 
checking behind here so I'd like to
leave<00:04:41.540> yeah<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:41.930> think<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.260> opponents<00:04:42.890> called

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
leave yeah I think so opponents called

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.450 
leave yeah I think so opponents called
us<00:04:43.160> on<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.400> flop<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.260> obviously<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
us on the flop it's not obviously the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.770 
us on the flop it's not obviously the
raw<00:04:46.850> straight<00:04:47.090> doors<00:04:47.300> cause<00:04:47.420> we've<00:04:47.570> got<00:04:47.690> one

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
raw straight doors cause we've got one

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.210 
raw straight doors cause we've got one
ourselves<00:04:48.080> but<00:04:48.230> it's<00:04:48.530> more<00:04:48.740> likely<00:04:48.950> I<00:04:49.070> think

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
ourselves but it's more likely I think

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.290 
ourselves but it's more likely I think
when<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.400> get<00:04:49.490> caught<00:04:49.670> in<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:49.880> slot<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.210> our

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
when we get caught in this slot that our

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.970 
when we get caught in this slot that our
opponent<00:04:50.690> has<00:04:51.050> kind<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.350> got<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.680> bit<00:04:51.890> of

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
opponent has kind of got a bit of

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.710 
opponent has kind of got a bit of
something<00:04:52.190> rather<00:04:52.460> than<00:04:52.670> necessarily<00:04:53.180> being

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
something rather than necessarily being

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.910 
something rather than necessarily being
on<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.900> drawers<00:04:54.200> no<00:04:54.320> flush<00:04:54.530> drawer<00:04:54.710> there<00:04:54.830> for

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
on the drawers no flush drawer there for

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.710 
on the drawers no flush drawer there for
example<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.030> think<00:04:56.210> when<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.450> card

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
example so and I think when this card

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.180 
example so and I think when this card
hits<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.080> it's<00:04:57.170> now<00:04:57.320> one<00:04:57.590> card<00:04:57.830> straight<00:04:58.130> I

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
hits and it's now one card straight I

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.740 
hits and it's now one card straight I
think<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.550> you're<00:04:58.640> right<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:58.820> my<00:04:59.420> opponents

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
think that you're right and my opponents

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.380 
think that you're right and my opponents
going<00:04:59.870> to<00:04:59.930> check<00:05:00.110> behind<00:05:00.410> so<00:05:00.740> often<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:02.240> we

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
going to check behind so often that we

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.000 
going to check behind so often that we
need<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:02.630> be<00:05:02.750> betting<00:05:03.050> are<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.680> for<00:05:03.770> value

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
need to be betting are and for value

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.090 
need to be betting are and for value
here<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.850> only<00:05:05.090> time<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.900> would<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.380> prefer<00:05:06.770> to

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
here the only time I would I prefer to

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.340 
here the only time I would I prefer to
check<00:05:07.310> would<00:05:07.490> be<00:05:07.550> if<00:05:07.910> rip<00:05:08.419> against<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.870> really

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
check would be if rip against the really

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.260 
check would be if rip against the really
aggressive<00:05:09.440> opponent<00:05:10.310> who<00:05:10.430> has<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.790> propensity

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
aggressive opponent who has a propensity

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.380 
aggressive opponent who has a propensity
to<00:05:11.630> turn<00:05:11.870> pretty<00:05:12.650> good<00:05:12.980> hand<00:05:13.220> into<00:05:13.850> Bluffs<00:05:14.150> on

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
to turn pretty good hand into Bluffs on

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.510 
to turn pretty good hand into Bluffs on
on<00:05:14.630> scary<00:05:15.050> rivers<00:05:15.500> we<00:05:15.950> doesn't<00:05:16.310> know<00:05:16.370> that

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
on scary rivers we doesn't know that

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520 
on scary rivers we doesn't know that
combo<00:05:16.850> is<00:05:16.970> this<00:05:17.120> type<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.480> guy<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:18.169> I<00:05:18.350> think

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
combo is this type of guy and I think

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.170 
combo is this type of guy and I think
they'll<00:05:18.620> make<00:05:18.650> more<00:05:18.980> sense<00:05:19.190> if<00:05:19.640> we'd<00:05:19.910> have<00:05:20.030> bet

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
they'll make more sense if we'd have bet

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.750 
they'll make more sense if we'd have bet
the<00:05:20.330> turn<00:05:20.630> again<00:05:21.290> then<00:05:22.010> we<00:05:22.190> can<00:05:22.340> check<00:05:22.550> the

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
the turn again then we can check the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.790 
the turn again then we can check the
river<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.240> sell<00:05:23.510> weakness<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.230> maybe<00:05:24.500> get<00:05:24.740> our

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
river to sell weakness and maybe get our

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.400 
river to sell weakness and maybe get our
opponent<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.910> represent<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.690> just<00:05:26.990> a

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
opponent to to represent this just a

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.080 
opponent to to represent this just a
straight<00:05:27.740> but<00:05:27.979> I<00:05:28.160> think<00:05:28.550> now<00:05:28.790> that<00:05:28.820> we've

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
straight but I think now that we've

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.940 
straight but I think now that we've
checked<00:05:29.330> called<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.750> turn<00:05:29.960> actually<00:05:30.470> makes

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
checked called the turn actually makes

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.469 
checked called the turn actually makes
it<00:05:31.070> more<00:05:31.220> likely<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:31.580> we<00:05:32.030> could<00:05:32.210> have<00:05:32.330> hit<00:05:32.450> a

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
it more likely that we could have hit a

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.090 
it more likely that we could have hit a
straight<00:05:32.720> ourselves<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.530> we've<00:05:33.890> got<00:05:34.070> a

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
straight ourselves and we've got a

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.100 
straight ourselves and we've got a
non-believer<00:05:34.790> encumbered<00:05:35.419> 110

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
non-believer encumbered 110

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.469 
non-believer encumbered 110
Cox<00:05:36.350> he<00:05:36.530> actually<00:05:36.830> over<00:05:37.340> bet<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.640> pot<00:05:37.850> got<00:05:38.450> a

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
Cox he actually over bet the pot got a

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.330 
Cox he actually over bet the pot got a
quick<00:05:38.780> call<00:05:39.050> from<00:05:39.080> combo<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.800> his<00:05:39.919> two<00:05:40.130> pair

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
quick call from combo of his two pair

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.500 
quick call from combo of his two pair
which<00:05:40.580> nothing<00:05:40.850> more<00:05:41.180> than<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.330> bluff

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
which nothing more than the bluff

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.659 
which nothing more than the bluff
capture<00:05:41.870> on<00:05:41.990> that<00:05:42.140> river<00:05:42.320> so<00:05:42.710> Cox<00:05:43.400> he's<00:05:43.520> gonna

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
capture on that river so Cox he's gonna

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.020 
capture on that river so Cox he's gonna
pick<00:05:43.880> up<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.090> nice<00:05:44.300> pot<00:05:44.660> no<00:05:44.810> 66<00:05:45.530> pounds<00:05:45.890> and<00:05:46.370> got

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
pick up a nice pot no 66 pounds and got

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.730 
pick up a nice pot no 66 pounds and got
lucky<00:05:47.390> to<00:05:47.479> get<00:05:47.600> river<00:05:47.840> Cole<00:05:48.110> they're<00:05:48.320> actually

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
lucky to get river Cole they're actually

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.650 
lucky to get river Cole they're actually
maybe<00:05:49.040> the<00:05:49.160> over<00:05:49.370> bet<00:05:49.550> did<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:49.880> so<00:05:50.150> yeah<00:05:50.570> I'm

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
maybe the over bet did it so yeah I'm

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.909 
maybe the over bet did it so yeah I'm
not<00:05:50.690> finding<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.140> over<00:05:51.290> bet<00:05:51.410> they're<00:05:51.560> really

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
not finding the over bet they're really

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.620 
not finding the over bet they're really
because<00:05:52.160> I<00:05:52.190> think<00:05:52.250> a<00:05:52.610> straight<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.300> likely

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
because I think a straight is so likely

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.250 
because I think a straight is so likely
for<00:05:53.780> us<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:53.960> have<00:05:54.310> and<00:05:55.540> also<00:05:56.540> if<00:05:56.840> we<00:05:57.050> were

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
for us to have and also if we were

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.280 
for us to have and also if we were
bluffing<00:05:58.150> also<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.210> know<00:05:59.479> it's<00:06:00.020> the<00:06:00.169> one

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
bluffing also you know it's the one

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.390 
bluffing also you know it's the one
concentrate<00:06:00.710> so<00:06:00.800> I<00:06:00.830> opponent<00:06:01.190> could<00:06:01.280> easily

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
concentrate so I opponent could easily

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.010 
concentrate so I opponent could easily
have<00:06:01.610> it<00:06:01.700> why<00:06:01.850> would<00:06:02.060> be<00:06:02.210> risking<00:06:02.690> more<00:06:02.840> than

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
have it why would be risking more than

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.350 
have it why would be risking more than
the<00:06:03.140> pot<00:06:03.320> when<00:06:03.530> you<00:06:03.979> know<00:06:04.100> 3/4<00:06:04.640> size<00:06:04.729> bet<00:06:05.240> would

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
the pot when you know 3/4 size bet would

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360 
the pot when you know 3/4 size bet would
probably<00:06:05.630> cheat<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:05.870> same<00:06:06.050> thing<00:06:06.260> so<00:06:06.500> yeah<00:06:07.340> I

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
probably cheat the same thing so yeah I

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.530 
probably cheat the same thing so yeah I
think<00:06:07.610> it's<00:06:07.700> very<00:06:07.790> fortunate<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.300> get<00:06:08.390> paid

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
think it's very fortunate to get paid

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.560 
think it's very fortunate to get paid
off<00:06:08.690> there<00:06:08.900> so<00:06:09.740> in<00:06:09.979> summary<00:06:10.460> when<00:06:11.030> it<00:06:11.150> comes<00:06:11.330> to

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
off there so in summary when it comes to

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.800 
off there so in summary when it comes to
suited<00:06:12.290> connectors<00:06:12.500> one<00:06:13.310> gaffers<00:06:13.850> is<00:06:14.630> it

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
suited connectors one gaffers is it

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.480 
suited connectors one gaffers is it
really<00:06:15.050> about<00:06:15.140> playing<00:06:15.860> those<00:06:16.040> kinds<00:06:16.430> of

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
really about playing those kinds of

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
really about playing those kinds of
hands<00:06:16.729> in<00:06:17.060> position<00:06:17.590> also<00:06:18.849> is<00:06:19.849> it<00:06:20.150> first<00:06:20.360> say

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
hands in position also is it first say

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.180 
hands in position also is it first say
they<00:06:20.630> play<00:06:20.810> better<00:06:21.020> in<00:06:21.229> multi<00:06:21.560> wave<00:06:21.710> pots

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
they play better in multi wave pots

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.980 
they play better in multi wave pots
yeah<00:06:22.700> I<00:06:22.729> think<00:06:23.000> both<00:06:23.270> of<00:06:23.300> those<00:06:23.539> points<00:06:23.900> are

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
yeah I think both of those points are

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.390 
yeah I think both of those points are
fair<00:06:24.169> I<00:06:24.349> would<00:06:24.470> say<00:06:24.680> position

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
fair I would say position

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.730 
fair I would say position
is<00:06:25.460> very<00:06:25.699> important<00:06:26.330> multi-way<00:06:27.229> parts<00:06:27.590> are

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
is very important multi-way parts are

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.189 
is very important multi-way parts are
good<00:06:27.949> but<00:06:28.430> more<00:06:28.970> important<00:06:29.360> than<00:06:29.419> anything<00:06:29.630> is

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
good but more important than anything is

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.379 
good but more important than anything is
suited<00:06:30.889> connectors<00:06:31.000> take<00:06:32.000> on<00:06:32.210> more

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
suited connectors take on more

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.930 
suited connectors take on more
significance<00:06:33.020> to<00:06:33.199> DP<00:06:33.710> you<00:06:33.860> get<00:06:34.130> if<00:06:34.370> you<00:06:34.880> are

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
significance to DP you get if you are

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.430 
significance to DP you get if you are
playing<00:06:35.270> a<00:06:35.419> tournament<00:06:35.600> for<00:06:35.930> example<00:06:36.289> and

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
playing a tournament for example and

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.740 
playing a tournament for example and
only<00:06:36.650> 20<00:06:37.039> 30<00:06:37.250> big<00:06:37.520> blinds<00:06:37.759> deep<00:06:38.030> suited

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
only 20 30 big blinds deep suited

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.510 
only 20 30 big blinds deep suited
connectors<00:06:38.870> are<00:06:39.289> pretty<00:06:39.470> much<00:06:39.650> garbage<00:06:40.100> hands

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
connectors are pretty much garbage hands

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.159 
connectors are pretty much garbage hands
but<00:06:40.880> if<00:06:41.150> you're<00:06:41.300> playing<00:06:41.449> a<00:06:41.570> cash<00:06:41.750> game<00:06:41.960> where

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
but if you're playing a cash game where

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.620 
but if you're playing a cash game where
you're<00:06:42.410> 150<00:06:43.190> 200<00:06:43.669> big<00:06:43.789> blinds<00:06:44.060> deep<00:06:44.240> on<00:06:44.419> more

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
you're 150 200 big blinds deep on more

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.659 
you're 150 200 big blinds deep on more
then<00:06:45.139> they're<00:06:45.380> pretty<00:06:45.650> much<00:06:45.949> as<00:06:46.190> good<00:06:46.430> as<00:06:46.550> ace

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
then they're pretty much as good as ace

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.180 
then they're pretty much as good as ace
king<00:06:46.970> and<00:06:47.330> ace<00:06:47.720> queen<00:06:48.020> yeah<00:06:48.470> and<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:48.680> converse

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
king and ace queen yeah and the converse

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.529 
king and ace queen yeah and the converse
of<00:06:49.220> that<00:06:49.340> obviously<00:06:49.639> if<00:06:49.729> you<00:06:49.850> are<00:06:50.000> having<00:06:50.389> to

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
of that obviously if you are having to

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.510 
of that obviously if you are having to
be<00:06:50.630> sure<00:06:50.780> stacking<00:06:51.169> a<00:06:51.199> cash<00:06:51.560> game<00:06:51.740> then<00:06:51.979> you

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
be sure stacking a cash game then you

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.830 
be sure stacking a cash game then you
know<00:06:52.669> you<00:06:52.729> can't<00:06:53.270> afford<00:06:53.330> to<00:06:53.600> be<00:06:53.660> messing

know you can't afford to be messing

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.210 
know you can't afford to be messing
around<00:06:53.990> with<00:06:54.199> suitor<00:06:54.770> connectors<00:06:55.130> because

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
around with suitor connectors because

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.070 
around with suitor connectors because
you've<00:06:55.610> not<00:06:55.789> got<00:06:55.970> the<00:06:56.120> what<00:06:56.570> I<00:06:56.600> call<00:06:56.660> implied
