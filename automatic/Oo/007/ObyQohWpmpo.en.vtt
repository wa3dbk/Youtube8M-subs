00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
on using the alloy is quite useful so

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.939 
on using the alloy is quite useful so
you<00:00:57.100> can<00:00:57.280> bend<00:00:57.910> it<00:00:58.000> around<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.660> get<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.710> focus

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
you can bend it around and get the focus

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.500 
you can bend it around and get the focus
correct<00:01:00.879> on<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.329> display<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:04.210> gotta<00:01:04.360> make

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
correct on the display just gotta make

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.050 
correct on the display just gotta make
up<00:01:04.660> a<00:01:04.809> shroud<00:01:05.110> now<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.440> keep<00:01:05.710> out<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.890> light

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820 

well<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.630> plastic<00:01:11.470> shroud<00:01:11.770> that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
well this is the plastic shroud that

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.070 
well this is the plastic shroud that
I've<00:01:12.100> made<00:01:12.310> up<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.700> got<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.880> sheet<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.570> ABS

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
I've made up I got a sheet of ABS

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.440 
I've made up I got a sheet of ABS
material<00:01:14.710> from<00:01:14.920> one<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.790> these<00:01:15.909> places<00:01:16.270> that

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
material from one of these places that

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.819 
material from one of these places that
makes<00:01:16.780> sign<00:01:17.619> signage<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:20.170> was<00:01:20.320> only<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:20.590> few

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
makes sign signage it was only a few

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.190 
makes sign signage it was only a few
pounds<00:01:21.250> as<00:01:21.340> an<00:01:21.460> offcut

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
pounds as an offcut

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.520 
pounds as an offcut
I'm<00:01:23.200> gonna<00:01:23.470> spray<00:01:23.829> it<00:01:23.860> black<00:01:24.159> anyway<00:01:24.880> but<00:01:25.570> it's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
I'm gonna spray it black anyway but it's

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.410 
I'm gonna spray it black anyway but it's
quite<00:01:26.799> good<00:01:26.829> to<00:01:27.189> work<00:01:27.520> with<00:01:27.759> because<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.240> can

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
quite good to work with because you can

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.219 
quite good to work with because you can
actually<00:01:29.140> heat<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.500> up<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:30.130> bend<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.729> shape

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually heat it up and bend it to shape

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.469 
actually heat it up and bend it to shape
and<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.350> stays<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.710> place<00:01:33.280> pretty<00:01:33.520> good<00:01:33.640> so

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
and it stays in place pretty good so

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.490 
and it stays in place pretty good so
it's<00:01:35.049> looking<00:01:35.229> really<00:01:35.590> promising<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.399> think

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's looking really promising I think

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.139 
it's looking really promising I think
well<00:01:38.500> this<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.920> finished<00:01:39.250> result<00:01:39.430> made<00:01:40.000> up

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
well this is the finished result made up

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.800 
well this is the finished result made up
a<00:01:40.329> shroud<00:01:41.079> for<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.470> LCD<00:01:42.159> display<00:01:42.659> stuck<00:01:43.659> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
a shroud for the LCD display stuck the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.260 
a shroud for the LCD display stuck the
receiver<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.439> top<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.159> need<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.880> tidy<00:01:46.090> up

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
receiver on the top and need to tidy up

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.670 
receiver on the top and need to tidy up
the<00:01:46.329> wiring<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.020> sort<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.259> thing<00:01:47.500> but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
the wiring and that sort of thing but

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.590 
the wiring and that sort of thing but
basically<00:01:48.189> that's<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:51.030> underneath<00:01:52.030> we've<00:01:52.390> got

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
basically that's it underneath we've got

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.959 
basically that's it underneath we've got
the<00:01:52.869> display<00:01:53.469> where<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.040> show<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.340> fit<00:01:54.640> over

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
the display where the show to fit over

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.760 
the display where the show to fit over
there<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:58.240> basically<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.469> seems

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
there and that's basically it it seems

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.249 
there and that's basically it it seems
to<00:01:59.860> be<00:02:00.070> functioning<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:00.969> don't<00:02:01.149> really<00:02:01.329> see<00:02:02.140> how

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
to be functioning I don't really see how

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.149 
to be functioning I don't really see how
it's<00:02:02.439> gonna<00:02:02.590> work<00:02:02.920> out<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.670> practice
