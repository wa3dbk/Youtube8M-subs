like<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.820> heat

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
like that so then you take the heat

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.810 
like that so then you take the heat
shrink<00:01:45.030> tubing<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.630> provided<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.729> put<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
shrink tubing that's provided and put it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.480 
shrink tubing that's provided and put it
over<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.119> end<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> hose<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
over the end of the hose just like that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
over the end of the hose just like that
and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> push<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:52.280> push<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> end<00:01:53.579> on

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and then you push the push the end on

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.929 
and then you push the push the end on
just<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.460> bring<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:58.820> put<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
just like that you bring this up put the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.649 
just like that you bring this up put the
heat<00:02:00.090> shrink<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.049> against<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> fitting

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
heat shrink right up against the fitting

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.700 
heat shrink right up against the fitting
put<00:02:03.659> some<00:02:03.840> heat<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:06.259> my<00:02:07.259> shrinks

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
put some heat to it like that my shrinks

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.100 
put some heat to it like that my shrinks
pretty<00:02:08.009> quick

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
pretty quick

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.280 
pretty quick
don't<00:02:11.110> take<00:02:11.260> much<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.500> shrink<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:14.140> like

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
don't take much to shrink it just like

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.860 
don't take much to shrink it just like
that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.300 
that
then<00:02:16.870> I'm<00:02:17.200> going<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.500> putting<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.770> 90-degree

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
then I'm going to be putting a 90-degree

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.280 
then I'm going to be putting a 90-degree
90-degree<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> rubber<00:02:19.540> fitting<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:20.020> there<00:02:20.140> so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
90-degree a rubber fitting on there so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.870 
90-degree a rubber fitting on there so
you<00:02:20.410> take<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.680> rubber<00:02:20.860> fitting<00:02:21.099> you<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:21.790> this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
you take the rubber fitting you put this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.180 
you take the rubber fitting you put this
black<00:02:22.150> fitting<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.630> there<00:02:22.780> which<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.260> male

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
black fitting on there which is the male

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190

end<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> screw<00:02:24.910> on<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:26.019> goes

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
end of the screw on and this goes

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.949 
end of the screw on and this goes
together<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:28.569> take<00:02:28.780> this

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
together just like this you take this

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.140 
together just like this you take this
this<00:02:29.110> will<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.380> on<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.769> my<00:02:30.459> fuel<00:02:30.760> pressure

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
this will be on the my fuel pressure

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.780 
this will be on the my fuel pressure
regulator<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.830> will<00:02:33.040> go<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.280> you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
regulator and this will go on here you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.940 
regulator and this will go on here you
screw<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.269> on<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.660> there's<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.680> finished

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
screw it on and there's a finished

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.670 
screw it on and there's a finished
vacuum<00:02:36.340> line<00:02:36.519> end<00:02:37.200> takes<00:02:38.200> less<00:02:38.410> than<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.650> minute

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
vacuum line end takes less than a minute

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.770 
vacuum line end takes less than a minute

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
to make do it on the other end and that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.550 
to make do it on the other end and that
kind<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.019> stalling<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:44.080> here<00:02:44.260> are<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.440> two

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
kind of stalling so here are the two

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.190 
kind of stalling so here are the two
vacuum<00:02:44.980> lines<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.400> made<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.660> first<00:02:46.930> vacuum

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
both of these hoses in less than 10

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.900 
both of these hoses in less than 10
minutes<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.319> they<00:03:09.130> look<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.400> lot<00:03:09.549> better<00:03:09.819> than

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
minutes and they look a lot better than

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.170 
minutes and they look a lot better than
it<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.390> black<00:03:10.750> hose<00:03:11.640> stuck<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.820> couple

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it is the black hose stuck on a couple

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.380 
it is the black hose stuck on a couple
fittings<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.820> want<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> make<00:03:16.239> your

that you seen in the master kit they

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.740 
that you seen in the master kit they
even<00:03:23.829> make<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> kit<00:03:24.430> for<00:03:24.790> an<00:03:25.060> engine<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.720> think

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
even make a kit for an engine I think

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.300 
even make a kit for an engine I think
they<00:03:25.989> make<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.140> Mustang<00:03:26.590> kit<00:03:26.859> so<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.069> might<00:03:27.280> be

they make a Mustang kit so you might be

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.309 
they make a Mustang kit so you might be
able<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.519> get<00:03:27.640> one<00:03:27.819> for<00:03:28.359> your<00:03:28.420> entire<00:03:28.810> car<00:03:29.140> and

they also make carbon hose fibre which

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.390 
they also make carbon hose fibre which
is<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:31.780> cool<00:03:31.959> for<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.260> corn<00:03:32.680> hose<00:03:33.040> lines

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
is really cool for a corn hose lines

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.309 
is really cool for a corn hose lines
