just just laying around the hotel or if

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800 
just just laying around the hotel or if

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
you add home you just kind of just do

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.150 
you add home you just kind of just do
whatever<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:21.350> gotta<00:00:21.530> do<00:00:21.740> just<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:22.010> prepare

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
whatever you gotta do just to prepare

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.840 
whatever you gotta do just to prepare
for<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.119> game<00:00:23.330> nothing<00:00:24.290> too<00:00:24.470> silly<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.310> you

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
for the game nothing too silly so you

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.130 
for the game nothing too silly so you
know<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.060> just<00:00:26.180> really<00:00:26.300> relaxing<00:00:26.779> really<00:00:26.960> I

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
know it's just really relaxing really I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.000 
know it's just really relaxing really I
think<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:27.500> best<00:00:27.680> cure<00:00:27.920> is<00:00:28.070> probably<00:00:28.580> sleep

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
think the best cure is probably sleep

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.680 
think the best cure is probably sleep
because<00:00:31.010> you're<00:00:31.039> probably<00:00:31.970> watching<00:00:32.180> movies

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
because you're probably watching movies

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.689 
because you're probably watching movies
and<00:00:32.900> stuff<00:00:33.559> on<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:33.830> plane<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.070> doing<00:00:34.580> what

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
and stuff on the plane and doing what

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.689 
and stuff on the plane and doing what
not<00:00:34.879> but<00:00:35.030> i<00:00:35.900> think<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.770> no<00:00:37.070> more<00:00:37.280> thing<00:00:37.489> is<00:00:37.610> to

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
not but i think the no more thing is to

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.490 
not but i think the no more thing is to
try<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:37.910> get<00:00:38.120> back<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.720> your<00:00:39.050> sleeping

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
try and get back to your sleeping

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.420 
try and get back to your sleeping
patterns<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.010> just<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:41.020> hear<00:00:42.100> enjoy<00:00:43.100> the
