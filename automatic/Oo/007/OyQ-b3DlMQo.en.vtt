00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
this girl's spec jumping about I really

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.150 
this girl's spec jumping about I really
wish<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:55.090> had<00:05:55.270> a<00:05:55.300> raid<00:05:55.630> spec<00:05:56.020> though<00:05:56.260> I<00:05:56.470> think

the<00:05:57.760> raid<00:05:57.940> spec<00:05:58.270> would<00:05:58.419> just<00:05:58.570> be<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.960> massive

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
the raid spec would just be a massive

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.110 
the raid spec would just be a massive
step<00:05:59.800> up<00:05:59.980> from<00:06:00.160> what<00:06:00.280> I've<00:06:00.400> driven<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:00.970> raid

step up from what I've driven and raid

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.300 
step up from what I've driven and raid
spec<00:06:01.390> before<00:06:01.720> it's<00:06:02.050> just<00:06:02.200> a<00:06:02.530> massive<00:06:03.070> massive

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
spec before it's just a massive massive

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.740 
spec before it's just a massive massive
step<00:06:03.640> up<00:06:03.790> it's<00:06:03.970> like<00:06:04.150> literally<00:06:04.480> having<00:06:04.630> a

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
