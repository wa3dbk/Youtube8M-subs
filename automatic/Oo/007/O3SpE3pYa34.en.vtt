00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:14.309
 the guys will finish the areas involved 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.309
 for you first 2015 video 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.500
 some things are going on this year 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.180
 maybe put on facebook do not know 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.040
 when is it going to be there? 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.250
 there's even a project from here I 'm going to play 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.250
 this year from now on whenever 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.480
 want my articles written one world 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.789
 facebook group 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.410
 I'm going to make a video explaining 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.710
 some things because they have things 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.770
 that I say that I write that they are not 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.059
 clear because an image to listen to 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.309
 words between sometimes it 's better not to 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.739
 show in the video that I meant the 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.310
 that trying to explain with you wrote 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.320
 and it's the fight is worse if it's how you know 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.110
 who found the same image quality 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.700
 always always great positions but now 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.250
 we made a big investment in 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.390
 channel we doubled our 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.149
 employees 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.460
 now we have two people besides me being 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.080
 the presenter now has a camera 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.540
 class but not fixed and is of course but this 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.729
 is already a great cost to maintain the channel 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.380
 if the mega- sena winner is 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.410
 living and want to make a voluntary donation 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.210
 of 1% just because it won is symbolic for 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.610
 help fight a camera purchase 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.570
 digital play a little bit of image 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.210
 we accept, you 're serious now I 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.340
 I do not have sponsorship, do not 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 have no sponsorship because I like the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.580
 my freedom 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.979
 I had some proposals some people 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.010
 thank you from the heart one fund 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.030
 commercial partnership proposal 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.380
 but I'd rather stay with mine 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.170
 independence 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.070
 because if you today have a relationship 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 good 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.479
 I think you offer for that. 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.400
 with the price you are charging you need to be 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.830
 worrying I'll talk about your store well 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.990
 now if it is not no use you want 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.670
 this appeal composed of revocation 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.880
 because I 'm going to speak ill of your 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.439
 shop of course a constructive criticism 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.380
 for us to improve the hobby and 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.659
 suddenly fix some errors 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.539
 all people commit without being 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.410
 realizing in the channel always win always 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.300
 it's possible because I prefer it so I 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.610
 I prefer that my freedom to where I 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.950
 Do you want me to think about writing what? 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.930
 I want to think 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.840
 basically that's it folks 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.680
 there are some things I have next year 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.630
 I was seeing 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.370
 I think it's a level really like 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.500
 some people have suggested compiling 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.050
 some things I've already written I think 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.680
 that by the end of the year and already an outline 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.340
 at least ready to treat and mature 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.340
 more this idea 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.000
 thanks guys that in 2015 is the clothes 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.000
 everything you think
