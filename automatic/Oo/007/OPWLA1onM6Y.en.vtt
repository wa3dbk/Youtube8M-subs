they're able to do it but one of the
things<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.570> worrying<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.530> like

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
things I was worrying about is like

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.399 
things I was worrying about is like
whole<00:01:49.979> duty<00:01:50.100> ghosts<00:01:50.369> black<00:01:50.610> ops<00:01:50.820> 2<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.869> lot<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
whole duty ghosts black ops 2 a lot of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.899 
whole duty ghosts black ops 2 a lot of
the<00:01:52.500> past<00:01:52.710> call<00:01:52.950> duty<00:01:53.100> games<00:01:53.310> brought<00:01:53.579> an<00:01:53.729> old

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the past call duty games brought an old

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
the past call duty games brought an old
map<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.329> previous<00:01:54.750> call<00:01:54.930> duty<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
map from previous call duty and just

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.350 
map from previous call duty and just
retexture<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> added<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
retexture them and added them into the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.389 
retexture them and added them into the
DLC<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.409> hope<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.310> I'm

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
DLC so hope we don't see that but I'm

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.859 
DLC so hope we don't see that but I'm
pretty<00:01:59.700> sure<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> look

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
pretty sure we are because if you look

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.929 
pretty sure we are because if you look
at<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.409> pre-ordered<00:02:01.979> hold<00:02:02.549> advanced

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
at if you pre-ordered hold advanced

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
at if you pre-ordered hold advanced
warfare<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.930> got<00:02:04.110> Atlas<00:02:04.500> scourge<00:02:04.799> which<00:02:05.040> was

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
warfare you got Atlas scourge which was

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.880 
warfare you got Atlas scourge which was
a<00:02:05.430> cod4<00:02:06.090> map<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.290> free<00:02:07.409> textured

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
a cod4 map that was just free textured

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.770 
a cod4 map that was just free textured
so<00:02:08.489> hopefully<00:02:08.789> that's<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so hopefully that's not going to be a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.680 
so hopefully that's not going to be a
really<00:02:10.140> big<00:02:10.440> thing<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:11.330> Vegas<00:02:12.330> warfare

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
really big thing in Vegas warfare

really big thing in Vegas warfare
hopefully

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
hopefully

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
hopefully
so<00:02:13.650> chamber<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.340> decides<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.820> hey<00:02:15.000> you

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
so chamber you know decides like hey you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
so chamber you know decides like hey you
know<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.660> lot<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.320> companies<00:02:16.500> did<00:02:16.830> this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
know a lot of other companies did this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.830 
know a lot of other companies did this
lot<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.270> take<00:02:18.480> our<00:02:18.630> time<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
lot you know we can take our time and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
lot you know we can take our time and
make<00:02:18.990> different<00:02:19.350> maps<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:19.800> I'm<00:02:20.280> pretty<00:02:20.400> sure

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
make different maps but I'm pretty sure

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.800 
make different maps but I'm pretty sure
they<00:02:20.730> already<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:21.090> all<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> maps<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.690> know

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.180 
ready to go and stuff to you know just
launched<00:02:24.090> whatever<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:26.040> hopefully

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
launched whatever but you know hopefully

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.380 
launched whatever but you know hopefully
they're<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.760> some<00:02:26.940> good<00:02:27.060> maps<00:02:27.270> from

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
they're going to be some good maps from

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.090 
they're going to be some good maps from
like<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.780> older<00:02:28.110> games<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.890> cod4

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
like really older games that the cod4

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.860 
like really older games that the cod4
map<00:02:29.490> was<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:29.880> cool<00:02:30.060> retextured<00:02:30.630> because

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
map was pretty cool retextured because

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630 
map was pretty cool retextured because
we<00:02:30.990> haven't<00:02:31.260> played<00:02:31.410> pad<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> while<00:02:32.100> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
we haven't played pad for a while you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.890 
we haven't played pad for a while you
know<00:02:32.670> most<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.120> us<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.360> know<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.750> stick

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
know most of us you know we just stick

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
know most of us you know we just stick
to<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> current<00:02:34.440> game<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.250> know

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
to the current game that's out you know

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.920 
to the current game that's out you know
some<00:02:35.640> people<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:36.000> jump<00:02:36.270> back<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> older

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
some people do jump back to the older

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.320 
some people do jump back to the older
generation<00:02:37.770> games<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.580> that's<00:02:38.850> hopefully

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
generation games but that's hopefully

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.370 
generation games but that's hopefully
one<00:02:39.480> thing<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.080> too<00:02:40.200> much<00:02:40.320> of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
one thing that we don't see too much of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.080 
one thing that we don't see too much of
