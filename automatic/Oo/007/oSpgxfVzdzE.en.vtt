00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 identical begins with the bronze level whose purpose comes out in der insecurity 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.720
 along slopes of moderate slope gradually reducing the opening of 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 snowplow bike 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.430
 dystrophy release of edge hold and body orientation 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.430
 carried out in extension facilitates elimination 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.570
 the end of the episode takes place mainly using the support alone 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.580
 it is turned off 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
 sidekick friend 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.720
 to achieve this technical goal the link must develop three important ones 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.120
 Lifetime 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.890
 maintain balance to restore it while sliding 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.560
 among the exercises proposed in the educational path the main consists 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 in making short strokes of pistachios trying to keep the body 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.399
 perpendicular to the ping 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 go down a slope checking the speed 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.860
 maintain delicate tail foods on the edges throughout the slide 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 Internet - 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 wow 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.299
 how to obtain for all the tcg slip for tail systems in accordance with 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.299
 sharp edges 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 one 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.099
 ingerik to the external universe to slow down 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.589
 and releasing speed 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.589
 bugatti 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.219
 mmm 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.219
 but but 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.759
 to take motor lessons necessary to change direction 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.229
 listen to the support mainly on external lights in live deployment for 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.229
 favor the change of direction and towards motta 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.319
 releasing the edge grip excluding the orientation of the body 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.319
 reach the maximum slope 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.240
 boetti reached the maximum slope 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.450
 eliminate the bend by taking advantage of the support on the external ski 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.730
 i believe bending
