Alaska those samples were alive now
we're<00:01:39.250> discovering<00:01:39.670> how<00:01:40.270> they<00:01:40.479> adapt

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
from the very first extinction math you

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.180 
from the very first extinction math you
actually<00:02:58.900> get<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.260> your<00:02:59.470> disk<00:02:59.739> for<00:03:00.010> Call<00:03:00.159> of

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
Duty ghosts where basically everything

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.839 
Duty ghosts where basically everything
started<00:03:02.530> off<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.920> thought<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.310> finished<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.760> by

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
started off we thought we finished it by

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.039 
started off we thought we finished it by
setting<00:03:04.150> off<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.390> nuke<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.750> that's<00:03:04.930> what

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
setting off the nuke and that's what

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.390 
setting off the nuke and that's what
happens<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.379> you<00:03:05.470> complete<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.980> very<00:03:06.159> first

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
happens if you complete the very first

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.860 
happens if you complete the very first
extinction<00:03:06.849> map<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.480> obviously<00:03:07.720> these

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
extinction map but obviously these

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.600 
extinction map but obviously these

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
samples have been taken to this place in

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.940 
samples have been taken to this place in
Alaska<00:03:09.849> some<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.900> them<00:03:11.019> were<00:03:11.140> still<00:03:11.319> alive<00:03:11.620> and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
Alaska some of them were still alive and

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.009 
Alaska some of them were still alive and
it's<00:03:12.099> set<00:03:12.310> off<00:03:12.459> another<00:03:12.940> chain<00:03:13.360> sort<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
it's set off another chain sort of

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.890 
it's set off another chain sort of
reaction<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.680> way<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:14.920> chain<00:03:15.250> sort<00:03:15.730> of

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
reaction in a way in chain sort of

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.119 
reaction in a way in chain sort of
bringing<00:03:16.900> back<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.470> all<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.709> these<00:03:17.829> crazy

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
bringing back of all of these crazy

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.039 
bringing back of all of these crazy
aliens<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.819> all<00:03:18.879> of<00:03:19.030> them<00:03:19.209> developed<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.900> lot

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
aliens and all of them developed a lot

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.390 
aliens and all of them developed a lot
of<00:03:20.170> them<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.349> become<00:03:20.590> stronger<00:03:21.129> than<00:03:21.160> your

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
of them have become stronger than your

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.500 
of them have become stronger than your
abilities<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.030> I've<00:03:22.090> talked<00:03:22.269> about<00:03:22.359> this

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
abilities and I've talked about this

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.660 
abilities and I've talked about this
before<00:03:22.629> one<00:03:23.049> of<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.260> aliens<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.190> jumps

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
before one of the aliens as it jumps

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.160 
before one of the aliens as it jumps
will<00:03:24.790> actually<00:03:25.090> disappear<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.900> almost

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
will actually disappear and almost

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.470 
will actually disappear and almost
teleport<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.010> way<00:03:27.129> and<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.910> while<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.299> in

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
teleport in a way and so while it's in

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.349 
teleport in a way and so while it's in
the<00:03:28.510> air<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:29.410> can't<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.400> vanishes<00:03:31.090> you've

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
the air you can't see it vanishes you've

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.640 
the air you can't see it vanishes you've
got<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.569> kill<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.870> basically<00:03:32.230> when<00:03:32.409> it's<00:03:32.530> on

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
got to kill it basically when it's on

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.259 
got to kill it basically when it's on
ground<00:03:33.010> level<00:03:33.430> which<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.640> very<00:03:33.849> very<00:03:34.090> crazy

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
ground level which is very very crazy

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.940 
ground level which is very very crazy
now<00:03:34.569> one<00:03:35.049> of<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.200> things<00:03:35.349> which<00:03:35.500> I'm<00:03:35.620> really

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
now one of the things which I'm really

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.830 
now one of the things which I'm really
liking<00:03:36.190> for<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.579> trailer<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.420> lot<00:03:37.720> of

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
liking for this trailer is a lot of

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.170 
liking for this trailer is a lot of
cinematic<00:03:38.560> experiences<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> lot<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.609> cinematic

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
cinematic experiences a lot of cinematic

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.690 
cinematic experiences a lot of cinematic
clips<00:03:40.599> but<00:03:41.109> obviously<00:03:41.560> not<00:03:41.859> directly<00:03:42.220> taken

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
clips but obviously not directly taken

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.369 
clips but obviously not directly taken
from<00:03:42.940> somebody<00:03:43.510> actually<00:03:43.690> playing<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.200> game

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
from somebody actually playing the game

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.899 
from somebody actually playing the game
that<00:03:44.560> actually<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.829> video<00:03:44.980> sequence<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.849> I'm

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
that actually a video sequence and I'm

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.479 
that actually a video sequence and I'm
hoping<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.260> going<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.799> included

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
hoping that this is going to be included

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.190 
hoping that this is going to be included
within<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.909> map<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.299> we're<00:03:49.930> going<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.079> be

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
within the map and we're going to be

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.099 
within the map and we're going to be
getting<00:03:50.349> some<00:03:50.440> sort<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.769> video<00:03:50.950> introduction

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
getting some sort of video introduction

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.300 
getting some sort of video introduction
maybe<00:03:53.109> even<00:03:53.380> cutscenes<00:03:53.859> as<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.099> play

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
maybe even cutscenes as you play

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.370 
maybe even cutscenes as you play
throughout<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.700> map<00:03:55.000> having<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.599> video<00:03:55.750> ending

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
throughout the map having a video ending

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.990 
throughout the map having a video ending
as<00:03:56.530> well<00:03:56.739> sorting<00:03:57.099> geek<00:03:57.310> sort<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.609> giving<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:57.940> a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
as well sorting geek sort of giving it a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.150 
as well sorting geek sort of giving it a
sort<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.239> storyline<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.410> assuming<00:03:59.980> that

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
sort of storyline that's assuming that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.099 
sort of storyline that's assuming that
of<00:04:00.250> course<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.669> map<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.180> same<00:04:01.630> as<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.900> very

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
of course this map is the same as a very

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.900 
of course this map is the same as a very
first<00:04:02.470> extinction<00:04:02.950> map<00:04:03.069> where<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.340> can<00:04:03.609> get

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
first extinction map where you can get

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.059 
first extinction map where you can get
to<00:04:04.090> an<00:04:04.180> end<00:04:04.419> point<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.049> essentially<00:04:05.590> complete

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
to an end point and essentially complete

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.619 
to an end point and essentially complete
the<00:04:06.280> map<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.669> I<00:04:06.849> would<00:04:06.970> really<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.450> see

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
the map and I would really like to see

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.879 
the map and I would really like to see
that<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.810> think<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.079> gives<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.739> whole

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
that I think it gives the whole

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.309 
that I think it gives the whole
extinction<00:04:09.549> mode<00:04:09.790> more<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:10.810> storyline

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
extinction mode more of a storyline

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.979 
extinction mode more of a storyline
behind<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.220> basically<00:04:13.209> engrosses<00:04:13.870> you

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
behind it and basically engrosses you

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.839 
behind it and basically engrosses you
more<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.349> what's<00:04:14.769> going<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:15.459> that's<00:04:15.639> very

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
more in what's going on so that's very

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.819 
more in what's going on so that's very
very<00:04:16.060> cool<00:04:16.329> as<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:16.959> said<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.199> do<00:04:17.320> get<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.620> new

very cool as I said we do get that new
alien<00:04:18.250> which<00:04:18.370> jumps<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:18.940> air<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.120> sort<00:04:19.239> of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.400 
which I'm very glad we're seeing I think
the<00:04:24.970> addition<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.599> new<00:04:25.780> weapons<00:04:26.080> each<00:04:26.199> time

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
the addition of new weapons each time

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.810 
the addition of new weapons each time
we've<00:04:26.530> got<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> new<00:04:26.830> zombies<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:27.340> was<00:04:27.460> awesome

and the fact that they seem to be doing

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.810 
and the fact that they seem to be doing
something<00:04:29.770> similar<00:04:30.130> with<00:04:30.250> extinction<00:04:30.550> mode

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
something similar with extinction mode

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.279 
something similar with extinction mode
is<00:04:30.940> very<00:04:31.150> very<00:04:31.360> cool<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.690> weapons<00:04:32.050> look

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
is very very cool and the weapons look

is very very cool and the weapons look
awesome<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:33.190> way<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:33.550> which<00:04:33.699> the<00:04:33.849> weapon<00:04:34.120> acts

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.839 
awesome the way in which the weapon acts
is<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.900> it's<00:04:35.050> almost<00:04:35.289> as<00:04:35.530> if<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:36.010> sticky

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
is that it's almost as if it's a sticky

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.120 
is that it's almost as if it's a sticky
grenade<00:04:37.210> launcher<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.410> fires<00:04:38.680> out<00:04:38.919> this

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
grenade launcher and it fires out this

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.270 
grenade launcher and it fires out this
this<00:04:39.789> green<00:04:40.240> sort<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.720> blob<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.099> I<00:04:42.130> think

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
this green sort of blob of so I think

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.760 
this green sort of blob of so I think
it's<00:04:42.490> actually<00:04:42.580> an<00:04:43.000> alien<00:04:43.330> blood<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.169> it

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
it's actually an alien blood and it

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.520 
it's actually an alien blood and it
sticks<00:04:45.099> to<00:04:45.490> me<00:04:46.060> for<00:04:46.240> an<00:04:46.300> enemy<00:04:46.449> alien<00:04:47.050> or

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
sticks to me for an enemy alien or

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.050 
sticks to me for an enemy alien or
sticks<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> rule<00:04:48.070> then<00:04:48.280> explodes<00:04:48.820> with

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
sticks to the rule then explodes with

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.700 
sticks to the rule then explodes with
the<00:04:49.150> effect<00:04:49.479> of<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.720> sort<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.960> grenade<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:50.620> it

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
the effect of a sort of grenade so it

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.040 
the effect of a sort of grenade so it
looks<00:04:50.889> very<00:04:50.949> very<00:04:51.280> cool<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.789> I<00:04:52.389> mean<00:04:52.570> at<00:04:52.960> the

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
looks very very cool and I mean at the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.350 
looks very very cool and I mean at the
end<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.349> this<00:04:54.039> actual<00:04:54.550> trailer<00:04:54.849> clip<00:04:55.090> we<00:04:55.210> get<00:04:55.330> a

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
end of this actual trailer clip we get a

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.839 
end of this actual trailer clip we get a
look<00:04:55.539> again<00:04:55.659> this<00:04:55.990> massive<00:04:56.440> scorpion<00:04:57.280> spider

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
look again this massive scorpion spider

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.190 
look again this massive scorpion spider
alien<00:04:58.510> which<00:04:58.599> is<00:04:58.780> massive<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.620> absolute

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
alien which is massive and absolute

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.680 
alien which is massive and absolute
crazy<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.920> I<00:05:01.520> believe<00:05:01.880> that<00:05:02.120> will<00:05:02.300> probably

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
crazy and I believe that will probably

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.870 
crazy and I believe that will probably
be<00:05:02.870> what<00:05:03.320> we<00:05:03.410> will<00:05:03.500> find<00:05:03.710> towards<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.430> end<00:05:04.640> of

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
be what we will find towards the end of

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.550 
be what we will find towards the end of
the<00:05:04.970> mapper<00:05:05.180> sort<00:05:05.420> like<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.600> big<00:05:05.810> boss<00:05:06.140> a<00:05:06.200> big

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
the mapper sort like the big boss a big

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.130 
the mapper sort like the big boss a big
thing<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.130> we<00:05:07.190> need<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.430> take<00:05:07.610> on<00:05:07.910> and<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.780> am
