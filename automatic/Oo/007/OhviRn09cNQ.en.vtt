00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.919 

all<00:00:01.740> right<00:00:01.890> let's<00:00:02.100> see<00:00:02.310> if<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.929> generator

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
all right let's see if this generator

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.600 
all right let's see if this generator
decides<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.950> fire<00:00:05.370> up<00:00:06.259> it's<00:00:07.259> got<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.610> solenoid

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
decides to fire up it's got a solenoid

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.720 
decides to fire up it's got a solenoid
cut<00:00:08.970> out<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> fuel<00:00:09.630> supply<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.370> that's<00:00:11.370> why

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
cut out on the fuel supply so that's why

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.129 
cut out on the fuel supply so that's why
some<00:00:11.940> 12<00:00:12.210> volts<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:14.509> yeah<00:00:15.540> fuels<00:00:15.900> on

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
some 12 volts for that one yeah fuels on

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960 
some 12 volts for that one yeah fuels on
I've<00:00:16.410> already<00:00:16.650> primed<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.340> line<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I've already primed the line up to the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510 
I've already primed the line up to the
injector<00:00:18.830> let's<00:00:19.830> hope<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> starter<00:00:20.490> motor

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
injector let's hope the starter motor

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.490 
injector let's hope the starter motor
behaves<00:00:21.029> because<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.840> wasn't<00:00:22.140> doing<00:00:22.380> very

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
behaves because it wasn't doing very

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
behaves because it wasn't doing very
well<00:00:22.710> before<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.660> think<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> wrong

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
well before I think it's the wrong

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.259 
well before I think it's the wrong
starter<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> engine

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
starter for the engine

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.550 
starter for the engine
someone's<00:00:27.269> replaced<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> got<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> wrong

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
someone's replaced it and got the wrong

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:54.470 
someone's replaced it and got the wrong
one

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:40.550 

come<00:00:55.480> on

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.680 

let's<00:01:41.560> try<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.830> start<00:01:42.040> on<00:01:42.160> high-speed<00:01:42.660> now<00:01:43.660> a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
let's try and start on high-speed now a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:02:07.810 
let's try and start on high-speed now a
bit<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.320> oil<00:01:44.500> pressure<00:01:44.740> up<00:01:44.950> anyway

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.140 

what<00:02:08.820> worked

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
what worked

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.990 
what worked
okay<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.230> low-speed<00:02:13.370> doesn't<00:02:14.370> work<00:02:14.520> anymore

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
okay so low-speed doesn't work anymore

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.450 
okay so low-speed doesn't work anymore
it's<00:02:15.960> supposed<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.410> an<00:02:16.530> idle<00:02:16.950> speed<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
it's supposed to have an idle speed and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.580 
it's supposed to have an idle speed and
then<00:02:17.610> lock<00:02:18.360> into<00:02:18.630> high<00:02:18.780> speed<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.350> runs

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
then lock into high speed and it runs

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.240 
then lock into high speed and it runs
but<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:21.330> doesn't<00:02:21.660> work<00:02:21.780> anymore<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.170> let's<00:02:23.130> try

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
but it doesn't work anymore so let's try

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.190 
but it doesn't work anymore so let's try
that<00:02:23.400> again<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.850> I'll<00:02:24.000> drop<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.110> bit

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that again but I'll drop a little bit

00:02:25.200 --> 00:06:17.480 
that again but I'll drop a little bit
myself

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.900 

Wow

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
Wow

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.140 
Wow
what<00:06:19.480> a<00:06:19.510> beast<00:06:23.040> lair<00:06:24.040> wood<00:06:24.310> no<00:06:24.520> exhaust<00:06:24.970> on<00:06:25.120> it

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
what a beast lair wood no exhaust on it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.350 
what a beast lair wood no exhaust on it
I<00:06:26.400> guess<00:06:27.400> I<00:06:27.490> would<00:06:27.610> have<00:06:27.640> had<00:06:27.790> better<00:06:28.090> put<00:06:28.330> that

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
I guess I would have had better put that

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.190 
I guess I would have had better put that
exhaust<00:06:28.750> back<00:06:28.930> together<00:06:29.110> again

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
exhaust back together again

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.450 
exhaust back together again
no<00:06:32.670> that's<00:06:33.670> fun<00:06:34.890> this<00:06:35.890> is<00:06:35.950> kind<00:06:36.220> of<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.370> middle

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
no that's fun this is kind of the middle

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.230 
no that's fun this is kind of the middle
of<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.730> night<00:06:36.880> but<00:06:37.650> who<00:06:38.650> cares<00:06:38.920> everyone<00:06:39.820> love

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
of the night but who cares everyone love

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.080 
of the night but who cares everyone love
stays<00:06:40.480> those<00:06:40.690> in<00:06:40.810> the<00:06:40.870> middle<00:06:41.080> of<00:06:41.140> the<00:06:41.230> night<00:06:41.380> I

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.160 

gotta<00:06:46.090> make<00:06:46.210> some<00:06:46.270> more<00:06:46.450> gaskets<00:06:46.930> for<00:06:47.050> that

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
gotta make some more gaskets for that

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.770 
gotta make some more gaskets for that
thing<00:06:47.670> the<00:06:48.670> one<00:06:48.790> against<00:06:49.090> the<00:06:49.240> head<00:06:49.390> was<00:06:49.540> blown

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
thing the one against the head was blown

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.670 
thing the one against the head was blown
out<00:06:50.080> so<00:06:50.110> wouldn't<00:06:51.010> it<00:06:51.070> be<00:06:51.130> much<00:06:51.310> better<00:06:52.680> anywho

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
out so wouldn't it be much better anywho

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.680 
out so wouldn't it be much better anywho
I<00:06:53.980> think<00:06:54.700> that's<00:06:54.850> enough<00:06:55.030> for<00:06:55.150> tonight<00:06:55.300> and

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
I think that's enough for tonight and

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.110 
I think that's enough for tonight and
thanks<00:06:55.930> for<00:06:56.020> watching
