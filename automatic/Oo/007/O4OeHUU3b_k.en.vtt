00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
classic bottle shaped tube microphone it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.230 
classic bottle shaped tube microphone it
features<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> frequency<00:00:20.250> response<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.880> 20

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
features a frequency response of 20

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
features a frequency response of 20
Hertz<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.689> 20<00:00:22.050> kilohertz<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:23.130> handles<00:00:23.580> high

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
Hertz to 20 kilohertz it handles high

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.470 
Hertz to 20 kilohertz it handles high
SPL<00:00:24.240> s<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> 133<00:00:25.470> DB<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.160> only<00:00:26.699> has<00:00:26.880> self-noise

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
SPL s of 133 DB and only has self-noise

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.679 
SPL s of 133 DB and only has self-noise
of<00:00:27.830> 21<00:00:28.830> DBA<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.390> quiet

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
of 21 DBA so it's actually a very quiet

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.470 
of 21 DBA so it's actually a very quiet
microphone<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> mic<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.579> does<00:00:33.180> have

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
microphone for it to mic it does have

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.290 
microphone for it to mic it does have
dual<00:00:34.079> one-inch<00:00:35.040> gold<00:00:35.340> sputtered<00:00:35.760> diaphragms

dual one-inch gold sputtered diaphragms

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
dual one-inch gold sputtered diaphragms
in<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.530> multiple<00:00:37.920> patterns<00:00:38.160> here

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
in it so you have multiple patterns here

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.459 
in it so you have multiple patterns here
which<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.090> selectable<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.930> front

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
which is actually selectable up front

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
which is actually selectable up front
and<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.420> can

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and as you can see right here you can

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.799 
and as you can see right here you can
switch<00:00:43.050> between<00:00:43.410> omnidirectional<00:00:46.579> cardioid

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
switch between omnidirectional cardioid

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.020

smooth response the mid-range is full
and<00:04:11.350> detailed<00:04:11.560> but<00:04:12.100> it's<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.430> overpowering

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
and detailed but it's not overpowering

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
or too up forward there is a touch of

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.029 
or too up forward there is a touch of
enhancement<00:04:17.079> in<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.200> low<00:04:17.380> end<00:04:17.410> but<00:04:17.650> it's<00:04:17.890> not

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
enhancement in the low end but it's not

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.279 
enhancement in the low end but it's not
overpowering<00:04:18.340> either<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.329> it's<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.229> just

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
overpowering either and it's it just

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.930 
overpowering either and it's it just
helps<00:04:20.680> kind<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:20.950> fill<00:04:21.250> things<00:04:21.519> out<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:21.789> give<00:04:21.910> a

that application the one area when I was

that really blew me away and I would

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.710 
that really blew me away and I would

probably reach for this mic 99% of the

time when I'm doing this application

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.540 
time when I'm doing this application
double<00:05:19.360> miking<00:05:19.780> I<00:05:19.960> would<00:05:20.620> definitely<00:05:21.159> reach

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
double miking I would definitely reach

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.399 
double miking I would definitely reach
for<00:05:21.759> this<00:05:21.849> mic<00:05:22.090> when<00:05:22.630> it<00:05:22.750> comes<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.139> double

just off access from the porthole it's
just<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.259> gives<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.099> much<00:05:39.280> depth<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.000> just

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
just it gives you so much depth and just

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.540 
just it gives you so much depth and just
