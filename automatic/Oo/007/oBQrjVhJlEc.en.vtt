00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
draw against a Stokes I'd that really

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.450

didn't offer that much more than

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700 
didn't offer that much more than
Sunderland<00:00:12.120> really<00:00:12.840> even<00:00:13.080> though<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.410> no

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710

Sunderland really even though we have no
name<00:00:13.980> go<00:00:14.370> he<00:00:14.610> might<00:00:14.759> as<00:00:14.910> well<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> deck

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
name go he might as well have had a deck

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.160 
name go he might as well have had a deck
chair<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:16.230> most<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> he<00:00:17.010> really<00:00:17.730> didn't

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
chair for most of it he really didn't

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.790 
chair for most of it he really didn't
have<00:00:19.170> very<00:00:19.470> much<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:21.050> but<00:00:22.050> when<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> team

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
have very much to do but when a team

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.890 
have very much to do but when a team
plays<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.310> Stoke<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:24.000> very<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.449> in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
plays like Stoke was very little in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170 
plays like Stoke was very little in
attack<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.130> few<00:00:26.160> long<00:00:26.490> balls<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
attack and just a few long balls and the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
attack and just a few long balls and the
hope<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.539> something<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> break<00:00:28.380> then<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
hope of something on the break then you

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.970 
hope of something on the break then you
have<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> work<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> way<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
have to you have to work out a way of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
have to you have to work out a way of
carving<00:00:32.700> them<00:00:32.850> open<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.420> creating<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.440> lot<00:00:35.160> of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
carving them open and creating a lot of

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.150 
carving them open and creating a lot of
chances<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.149> that's<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:38.100> we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
chances and that's not really what we

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.030 
chances and that's not really what we
did<00:00:38.579> today<00:00:41.030> positives<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> were<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
did today positives from it were the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
did today positives from it were the
fact<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:44.399> defense<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.420> solid

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
fact that our defense was really solid

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.740 
fact that our defense was really solid
we<00:00:45.930> dealt<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.200> kraut<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.980> well

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
we dealt with kraut really well

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
we dealt with kraut really well
midfields<00:00:48.750> been<00:00:48.930> good<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.530> our<00:00:50.100> Terran

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
midfields been good and our Terran

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
midfields been good and our Terran
because<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.329> working<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.170> well

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
because all are working really well

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.490 
because all are working really well
together<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.280> he's<00:00:53.610> creating<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.870> chance<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
together and he's creating the chance a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.970 
together and he's creating the chance a
lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> chances<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.640> had<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
lot of the chances that we have had and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760 
lot of the chances that we have had and
it's<00:00:58.980> encouraging<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.770> more

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it's encouraging to see the more more

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's encouraging to see the more more
long-range<00:01:02.010> shots<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> say<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:06.080> yes

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
long-range shots I have to say but yes

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.780 
long-range shots I have to say but yes
we<00:01:07.380> didn't<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.860> managed<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:10.159> penetrate<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
we didn't really managed to penetrate I

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.480 
we didn't really managed to penetrate I
suppose<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.350> final<00:01:13.710> third<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.280> that's

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
suppose in the final third and that's

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
suppose in the final third and that's
what's<00:01:15.170> really<00:01:16.170> letting<00:01:16.500> us<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
what's really letting us down at the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.020 
what's really letting us down at the
moment<00:01:17.909> Durham<00:01:18.600> podolsky<00:01:19.670> will<00:01:20.670> click

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
moment Durham podolsky will click

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.719 
moment Durham podolsky will click
eventually<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.350> will<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:22.950> goals<00:01:23.159> but

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
eventually they will get some goals but

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
eventually they will get some goals but
obviously<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.450> worrying<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.159> not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
obviously it's worrying when they're not

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.179 
obviously it's worrying when they're not
and<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.000> slightly<00:01:27.930> X<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.680> when<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> see

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and it's slightly X and when you see

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
and it's slightly X and when you see
that<00:01:29.430> Robin<00:01:29.759> van<00:01:29.880> Persie<00:01:29.939> has<00:01:30.540> started<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that Robin van Persie has started to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.800 
that Robin van Persie has started to
score<00:01:32.060> United<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.369> just

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
score United but you I don't know I just

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.539 
score United but you I don't know I just
the<00:01:36.810> most<00:01:36.960> annoying<00:01:37.350> thing<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.950> thinking<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the most annoying thing is thinking that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.179 
the most annoying thing is thinking that
what<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.850> he<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> song<00:01:40.200> had<00:01:40.530> stayed<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> we

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
what if he and song had stayed and we

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030 
what if he and song had stayed and we
had<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.670> current<00:01:42.270> players<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:43.649> we've<00:01:43.829> got

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
had these current players that we've got

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.539 
had these current players that we've got
now<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.479> every<00:01:45.930> time<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.350> sell<00:01:46.590> crucial

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
now it's just every time we sell crucial

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.660 
now it's just every time we sell crucial
players<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.060> beginning<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> season<00:01:49.670> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
players at the beginning of a season it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
players at the beginning of a season it
almost<00:01:51.420> feels<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.810> you're<00:01:51.899> starting<00:01:52.350> all

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
almost feels like you're starting all

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
almost feels like you're starting all
over<00:01:52.560> again<00:01:52.799> each<00:01:53.189> time<00:01:53.220> trying<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> build<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
over again each time trying to build and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.649 
over again each time trying to build and
we're<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:54.720> trying<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> build<00:01:55.200> another<00:01:55.290> side

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
we're now trying to build another side

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.170 
we're now trying to build another side
that's<00:01:57.659> based<00:01:57.930> around<00:01:58.170> different<00:01:58.500> players

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
that's based around different players

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.969 
that's based around different players
and<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> most<00:02:00.990> annoying<00:02:01.530> thing<00:02:01.860> but

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and that's the most annoying thing but

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.010 
and that's the most annoying thing but
it<00:02:02.070> will<00:02:02.219> come<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:06.090> fact<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.450> didn't

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it will come and the fact that we didn't

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
it will come and the fact that we didn't
have<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:07.890> extensive<00:02:08.039> preseason<00:02:10.550> also

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
have a very extensive preseason also

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.170 
have a very extensive preseason also
doesn't<00:02:11.879> help<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.420> means<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.810> they

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
doesn't help because it means that they

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.670 
doesn't help because it means that they
haven't<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.780> new<00:02:13.930> players<00:02:14.170> haven't<00:02:14.530> had<00:02:14.650> a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
haven't the new players haven't had a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.149 
haven't the new players haven't had a
lot<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.950> time<00:02:15.359> to<00:02:16.359> bed<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.719> so<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.530> didn't<00:02:18.040> have

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
lot of time to bed in so we didn't have

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.699 
lot of time to bed in so we didn't have
the<00:02:18.280> Emirates<00:02:18.609> Cup<00:02:18.849> this<00:02:19.030> year<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.629> don't<00:02:20.500> think

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
the Emirates Cup this year I don't think

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.759 
the Emirates Cup this year I don't think
we<00:02:20.829> even<00:02:20.859> played<00:02:21.189> a<00:02:21.310> friendly<00:02:21.579> on<00:02:22.349> home<00:02:23.349> soil

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
we even played a friendly on home soil

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.490 
we even played a friendly on home soil
this<00:02:24.400> year<00:02:24.670> which<00:02:24.879> would<00:02:25.329> have<00:02:25.480> helped<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:29.170> yes

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
this year which would have helped so yes

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.910 
this year which would have helped so yes
it's<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.500> not<00:02:32.950> particularly<00:02:34.409> inspiring<00:02:35.409> at

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
it's it's not particularly inspiring at

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.890 
it's it's not particularly inspiring at
the<00:02:36.040> moment<00:02:36.189> but<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.639> oh<00:02:36.670> I'm<00:02:37.090> positive<00:02:37.870> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the moment but I oh I'm positive that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.849 
the moment but I oh I'm positive that
the<00:02:38.290> team<00:02:39.359> with<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.389> team<00:02:40.689> keeping<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.319> couple

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
the team with the team keeping a couple

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.849 
the team with the team keeping a couple
of<00:02:41.950> clean<00:02:42.159> sheets<00:02:42.519> if<00:02:42.730> we<00:02:42.879> can<00:02:43.090> start<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:44.560> find

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
of clean sheets if we can start to find

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.309 
of clean sheets if we can start to find
that<00:02:45.159> cohesion<00:02:45.579> between<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:46.750> midfield<00:02:47.139> and

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
that cohesion between the midfield and

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.979 
that cohesion between the midfield and
the<00:02:47.409> forwards<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:49.180> we<00:02:49.540> will<00:02:49.689> start<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
the forwards then we will start to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.409 
the forwards then we will start to
school<00:02:50.290> girls<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.709> things<00:02:51.010> will<00:02:51.220> improve

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
school girls and things will improve

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:57.509 
school girls and things will improve
rapidly<00:02:52.859> from<00:02:53.859> that<00:02:54.040> point<00:02:54.280> onwards<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:56.519> we

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
rapidly from that point onwards so we

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.940 
rapidly from that point onwards so we
just<00:02:57.669> have<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.000> keep<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.540> we<00:02:58.659> do<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.379> lot

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
