00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
think was a left hook that landed a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.990

a<00:01:42.369> fighter<00:01:43.179> who<00:01:43.329> can<00:01:43.659> really<00:01:43.840> go<00:01:44.170> for<00:01:44.619> him<00:01:44.799> I

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.029 
a fighter who can really go for him I

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.999 
a fighter who can really go for him I
don't<00:01:46.029> see<00:01:46.179> him<00:01:46.270> going<00:01:46.420> any<00:01:46.659> far<00:01:46.899> I'm<00:01:47.829> sure

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
don't see him going any far I'm sure

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.139 
don't see him going any far I'm sure
he's<00:01:48.159> going<00:01:48.279> to<00:01:48.369> fight<00:01:48.549> maybe<00:01:48.729> one<00:01:48.969> or<00:01:49.090> two

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
he's going to fight maybe one or two

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.449 
he's going to fight maybe one or two
times<00:01:49.450> after<00:01:49.779> this<00:01:50.049> but<00:01:50.889> i<00:01:50.919> think<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.249> pretty

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
times after this but i think is pretty

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.169 
times after this but i think is pretty
much<00:01:51.609> done<00:01:52.409> he's<00:01:53.409> done<00:01:53.439> as<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.799> fighter<00:01:54.099> I<00:01:54.399> can't

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
much done he's done as a fighter I can't

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.230 
much done he's done as a fighter I can't
approach<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.659> new<00:01:56.099> European<00:01:57.240> heavyweight

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.659 
approach the new European heavyweight
champion<00:01:58.749> and<00:02:00.090> yeah<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.950> guess<00:02:02.950> one<00:02:03.189> more<00:02:03.219> fight

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:03.669

champion and yeah I guess one more fight
for<00:02:03.880> David<00:02:04.149> Price<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.689> think<00:02:05.020> one<00:02:05.469> more<00:02:05.619> fight

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
for David Price I think one more fight

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.419 
for David Price I think one more fight
in<00:02:06.069> his<00:02:06.609> hometown<00:02:06.959> his<00:02:07.959> homecoming<00:02:08.349> as<00:02:09.069> well

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
as his goodbye fight I think I think

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.890
