00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
it like yeah it's a really really strong

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.780 
it like yeah it's a really really strong
solid<00:04:03.609> story<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.209> would<00:04:04.750> make<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.930> good<00:04:05.410> film

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
solid story and would make a good film

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.460 
solid story and would make a good film

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
favorites or not so the big thing in

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.290 
favorites or not so the big thing in
Hollywood<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:42.650> it's<00:04:42.950> 3d<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.580> I've<00:04:43.700> even<00:04:44.000> CNN

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
Hollywood now it's 3d and I've even CNN

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.210 
Hollywood now it's 3d and I've even CNN
seen<00:04:44.630> animated<00:04:45.140> movies<00:04:45.380> in<00:04:45.530> 3d<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.070> do<00:04:46.130> you

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
seen animated movies in 3d so do you

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.250 
seen animated movies in 3d so do you
think<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.550> Warner<00:04:47.060> Brothers<00:04:47.420> that<00:04:47.750> DC<00:04:48.230> is

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
think that Warner Brothers that DC is

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.340 
think that Warner Brothers that DC is
going<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.830> get<00:04:48.920> into<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:50.060> DC<00:04:50.240> animated<00:04:51.020> movies

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
going to get into the DC animated movies

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.990 
going to get into the DC animated movies
that<00:04:51.680> are<00:04:51.800> in<00:04:51.860> 3d<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.400> think<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.700> guys<00:04:52.850> who

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
that are in 3d you think you guys who

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.210 
that are in 3d you think you guys who
ever<00:04:53.180> get<00:04:53.300> into<00:04:53.540> that<00:04:53.660> or<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.990> template<00:04:54.500> maybe

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
ever get into that or a template maybe

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.210 
ever get into that or a template maybe
probably<00:04:55.580> not<00:04:55.850> so<00:04:56.150> much<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.480> these<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
probably not so much in these the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.950 
probably not so much in these the
hand-drawn<00:04:58.670> traditional<00:04:59.270> animated<00:04:59.660> films

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
hand-drawn traditional animated films

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.680 
hand-drawn traditional animated films
probably<00:05:00.110> once<00:05:00.410> more<00:05:00.650> casinos<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:01.220> 3d<00:05:01.550> but<00:05:02.540> we

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
probably once more casinos in 3d but we

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.720 
probably once more casinos in 3d but we
are<00:05:02.810> starting<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.140> experiment<00:05:03.470> with<00:05:03.830> CGI<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:06.020> I

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
are starting to experiment with CGI so I

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.800 
are starting to experiment with CGI so I
can<00:05:07.730> pretty<00:05:07.880> much<00:05:07.970> guarantee<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:08.660> once

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
can pretty much guarantee you that once

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.420 
can pretty much guarantee you that once
we<00:05:08.930> start<00:05:09.140> doing<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.440> CGI<00:05:09.740> stuff<00:05:10.130> you'll

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
we start doing the CGI stuff you'll

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.620 
we start doing the CGI stuff you'll
probably<00:05:10.700> be<00:05:10.910> seeing<00:05:10.940> something<00:05:11.300> there<00:05:11.540> are

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
probably be seeing something there are

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.190 
probably be seeing something there are
service<00:05:11.990> copy<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:14.360> what<00:05:14.630> we're<00:05:14.900> going<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.110> go

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
service copy so what we're going to go

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.350 
service copy so what we're going to go
on<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.560> next<00:05:15.740> after<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:16.430> well<00:05:17.210> we've<00:05:17.330> got

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
on to next after this well we've got

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.510 
on to next after this well we've got
already<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:18.260> can<00:05:18.470> we've<00:05:18.740> already<00:05:18.860> got<00:05:19.100> all

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
already in the can we've already got all

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.820 
already in the can we've already got all
star<00:05:19.760> superman<00:05:19.880> coming<00:05:20.690> out<00:05:20.810> next<00:05:21.020> which<00:05:21.680> is

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
star superman coming out next which is

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.600 
star superman coming out next which is
awesome<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:23.750> after<00:05:24.230> that<00:05:24.260> is<00:05:24.530> a<00:05:24.560> Batman<00:05:25.490> year

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
awesome and after that is a Batman year

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.850 
awesome and after that is a Batman year
one<00:05:26.020> right<00:05:27.020> I<00:05:27.050> think<00:05:27.440> those<00:05:27.620> are<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.770> only

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
one right I think those are the only

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.320 
one right I think those are the only
things<00:05:28.010> that<00:05:28.160> we<00:05:28.250> had<00:05:28.730> allowed<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.060> talk<00:05:29.180> about

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
things that we had allowed to talk about

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.770 
things that we had allowed to talk about
it<00:05:30.370> so<00:05:31.370> do<00:05:31.580> you<00:05:31.640> think<00:05:31.700> me<00:05:31.940> Knight<00:05:32.090> Batman<00:05:32.360> year

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
it so do you think me Knight Batman year

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.240 
it so do you think me Knight Batman year
one<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:33.200> going<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.470> be<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.590> really<00:05:33.830> really<00:05:34.070> good

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
one is going to be a really really good

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.210 
one is going to be a really really good
and<00:05:34.490> France<00:05:34.700> we<00:05:34.820> don't<00:05:34.850> love<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:36.010> hope<00:05:37.010> so

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
and France we don't love that I hope so
