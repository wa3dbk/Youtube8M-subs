it's charging up and it's not spewing
liquid<00:02:15.170> everywhere<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.049> king<00:02:21.260> of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
liquid everywhere I'm the king of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.460 
liquid everywhere I'm the king of
mechanics<00:02:21.920> or<00:02:22.880> there<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.090> go<00:02:23.319> everything<00:02:24.319> is

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
mechanics or there we go everything is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.949 
mechanics or there we go everything is
cool<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.920> am<00:02:25.489> cool<00:02:25.760> I've<00:02:26.330> sorted<00:02:26.660> out<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
cool I am cool I've sorted out what the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.930 
cool I am cool I've sorted out what the
problem<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.380> however<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.280> believe<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:28.819> are

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
problem is however I believe there are

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.340 
problem is however I believe there are
more<00:02:29.060> challenging<00:02:29.569> things<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.930> be<00:02:30.019> thrown<00:02:30.200> at

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
more challenging things to be thrown at

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.910 
more challenging things to be thrown at
me<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.400> for<00:02:31.610> now<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.000> will<00:02:32.299> have<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> break<00:02:33.019> and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
me so for now I will have a break and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.080 
me so for now I will have a break and
then<00:02:34.070> I'll<00:02:34.190> come<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.579> get<00:02:34.700> stuck<00:02:34.940> into

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
then I'll come back and get stuck into

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.190 
then I'll come back and get stuck into
more<00:02:35.299> stuff<00:02:35.540> but<00:02:35.630> I've<00:02:35.750> been<00:02:35.900> good<00:02:36.049> I'm

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
more stuff but I've been good I'm

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.549 
more stuff but I've been good I'm
feeling<00:02:36.410> confident<00:02:36.769> I've<00:02:37.340> got
