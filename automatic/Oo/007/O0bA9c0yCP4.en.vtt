00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 but were taken to the routes to all who 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.230
 We survived were in the in the night up 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.389
 route in the camps and therefore survived you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 went down you suspected something not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.470
 Do get in contact with them to see 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 you came down on top of what you saw 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 but personally I was in the first camp in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.789
 seven in the morning I got up from the Sherpa base 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:34.020
 and local pakistani they warned 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.760
 that below all killed here at the top of those 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 who were taller than me by radio on 4 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 evil from the base contacted by radio 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 he was heard in the sky at night shots 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.379
 it was heard but some characteristic 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.590
 the sounds were so similar because 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.300
 thought that maybe the stones fall woven it 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.550
 but however like now 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.789
 say that yes heard it is true that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.420
 it was difficult to identify the dead 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.360
 we identified by photographs 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.650
 feather bed primary knowledge was 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.340
 the photos were small small 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.370
 size and so it was difficult yes then 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.120
 already 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.320
 in Islamabad were physically and cognitive 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.500
 before that something could foreshadow 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.880
 traditions will quietly twist no 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.940
 tragedies we did not think 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.070
 this kind of information was on the Internet 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.880
 what a few days think there because 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.470
 tragedies were also approached by representatives 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.840
 local people and offered to take 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.660
 Islam is true medicine secret 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.330
 opinion fit some people in whites 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.140
 clothes appeared in the camp but I'm with them 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.450
 did not communicate 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.270
 who are some of us who saw them we drive 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.920
 talked about Islam 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.410
 what is the official version of pakistani 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.210
 side of what happened to us bottoms they 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.220
 We also did not want to comment 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.290
 we do not know their official version 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.710
 Moreover 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.149
 the data for us is also very contradictory 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.540
 because what operation is performed on 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.900
 area and therefore those consequences of the operation 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.530
 some kind of compensation apology moved into 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.690
 what status are you affected there but in 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.670
 our support was as we were told 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.870
 some folk 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 demonstrations conducted studied yet 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.430
 somewhere we were held 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.400
 the plane was rather solemnly carried 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.650
 coffins with the army with all but or not love 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.370
 This distance love solemn 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.659
 the funeral, that is, they saluted 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.519
 way and as far as we know 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:55.489
 really carried out stripping 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:59.060
 operations in the area the area is cordoned off the area on 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.370
 there our things remained still arrested 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.790
 there is difficulty getting there and so on 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.260
 that is, they are doing something probably looking for 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.840

 he was already full of special forces army 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.920
