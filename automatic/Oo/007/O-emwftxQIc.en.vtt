the rundown of these videos will be i
will<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.599> speeding<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.620> video<00:00:13.860> and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
will just be speeding up the video and

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.189 
will just be speeding up the video and
voicing<00:00:14.759> over<00:00:14.969> them<00:00:15.150> blah<00:00:15.540> blah<00:00:15.719> blah<00:00:15.750> you

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
voicing over them blah blah blah you

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.349 
voicing over them blah blah blah you
guys<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:16.680> how<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.980> works<00:00:17.359> essentially

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
guys know how that works essentially

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
guys know how that works essentially
this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.050> exact<00:00:19.500> same<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.980> normal

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
this is the exact same as normal

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.429 
this is the exact same as normal
difficulty<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.090> significantly<00:00:21.779> harder<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
difficulty just significantly harder and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.500 
difficulty just significantly harder and
increased<00:00:23.630> damage<00:00:24.630> inflicted<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.670> increased

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
increased damage inflicted and increased

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.250 
increased damage inflicted and increased
enemy<00:00:27.840> health<00:00:29.090> same<00:00:30.090> mechanics<00:00:30.750> apply<00:00:30.900> for

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
enemy health same mechanics apply for

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.100 
enemy health same mechanics apply for
the<00:00:31.320> most<00:00:31.500> part<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.369> bosses<00:00:32.730> uh

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
the most part on most bosses uh

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.650 
the most part on most bosses uh
typically<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.890> mobs<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.149> abilities

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
typically like mobs will have abilities

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
typically like mobs will have abilities
now<00:00:36.840> they'll<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.380> AOE<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.219> will

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
now they'll do like AOE and they will

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.990 
now they'll do like AOE and they will
hit<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.910> truck<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> be

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
hit like truck so you just need to be

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.470 
hit like truck so you just need to be
more<00:00:42.210> wary<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.750> where<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.700> but<00:00:44.700> that's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
more wary of where you are but that's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.700 
more wary of where you are but that's
essentially<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.230> mean<00:00:46.410> these<00:00:46.500> aren't

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
essentially it I mean these aren't

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.360 
essentially it I mean these aren't
extremely<00:00:47.370> difficult<00:00:48.980> but<00:00:49.980> they<00:00:50.160> are

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
extremely difficult but they are

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
extremely difficult but they are
difficult<00:00:50.940> enough<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.570> keep<00:00:51.780> things

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
difficult enough to keep things

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.590 
difficult enough to keep things
interesting<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> not

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
interesting and to make you you know not

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
interesting and to make you you know not
just<00:00:54.780> face<00:00:55.170> roll<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.980> keyboard

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
just face roll all over your keyboard

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.450 
just face roll all over your keyboard
and<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.940> actually<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.570> pay<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.500> lot<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and you actually know pay some lot of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
and you actually know pay some lot of
attention<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.510> care<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
attention and actually care what the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.520 
attention and actually care what the
hell's<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.620> around<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:03.260> hats<00:01:04.260> off

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to blizzard for that as far as that guy

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
to blizzard for that as far as that guy
that<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.799> faced<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:09.119> nothing's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that we just faced really nothing's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
that we just faced really nothing's
changed<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:09.900> original<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.909> these<00:01:11.909> guards

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
changed from original there these guards

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.280 
changed from original there these guards
right<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.950> they<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.130> changed<00:01:14.549> mechanics

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
right here they have changed mechanics

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.499 
right here they have changed mechanics
they<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> AOE<00:01:17.250> lightning<00:01:18.150> thing

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they will do that AOE lightning thing

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.910 
they will do that AOE lightning thing
that<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.780> push<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> away<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.770> hit

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that will push you away and it will hit

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.820 
that will push you away and it will hit
for<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.400> 150<00:01:20.939> k<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.350> i<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
for about 150 k or so and i think it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
for about 150 k or so and i think it
ticks<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.250> more<00:01:23.700> each<00:01:24.000> time<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.630> hit<00:01:24.780> by

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
ticks for more each time you get hit by

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
ticks for more each time you get hit by
it<00:01:25.049> i<00:01:25.380> didn't<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> memo<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it i didn't get the memo at the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
it i didn't get the memo at the
beginning<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> tried<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> back<00:01:27.810> off<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.320> tried<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
beginning I tried to back off I tried to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.319 
beginning I tried to back off I tried to
back<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:30.030> didn't<00:01:30.299> work

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
back out of it that really didn't work

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.770 
back out of it that really didn't work
too<00:01:30.750> well<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:33.000> also<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> chain

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
too well and then they also have a chain

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.249 
too well and then they also have a chain
ability<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.470> pulls<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.310> towards<00:01:35.759> them

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
ability which pulls you in towards them

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
ability which pulls you in towards them
those<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.500> abilities<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:38.970> they

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
those two abilities are really all they

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.690 
those two abilities are really all they
have<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> offer<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:40.079> hit<00:01:40.290> pretty<00:01:40.590> hard

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
have to offer but they hit pretty hard

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.179 
have to offer but they hit pretty hard
so<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.759> need<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> avoid<00:01:42.659> those<00:01:42.990> I'll<00:01:43.950> end<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
so you need to avoid those I'll end it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.730 
so you need to avoid those I'll end it
on<00:01:44.280> strap<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:45.090> hit<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.450> 500k<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
on strap there got hit for 500k and that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
on strap there got hit for 500k and that
was<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.280> she<00:01:47.310> wrote<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.479> far<00:01:51.509> as

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
was all she wrote for me so as far as

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.990 
was all she wrote for me so as far as
that<00:01:51.840> goes<00:01:51.899> relatively<00:01:52.680> simple<00:01:52.950> stuff<00:01:53.159> just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that goes relatively simple stuff just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.569 
that goes relatively simple stuff just
you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.630> watch<00:01:55.500> watch<00:01:56.009> where<00:01:56.189> you're<00:01:56.310> going

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
you know watch watch where you're going

you need some raid awareness in this I'd
say<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.790> not<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.240> too<00:02:00.450> much<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.899> know<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
say but not not too much you know just

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990 
say but not not too much you know just
basic<00:02:01.680> stuff<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:02.159> stay<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> fire<00:02:02.729> don't

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
basic stuff don't stay in the fire don't

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.389 
basic stuff don't stay in the fire don't
stand<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.750> stand<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
stand this don't stand that you know it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.270 
stand this don't stand that you know it
pretty<00:02:05.969> simple<00:02:06.200> basic<00:02:07.200> wow<00:02:07.439> knowledge<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.190> if

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
pretty simple basic wow knowledge and if

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
pretty simple basic wow knowledge and if
you<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.119> point<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.599> why

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
you don't know at this point then why

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
you don't know at this point then why
and<00:02:10.140> how<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.800> still<00:02:11.009> playing<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.400> why<00:02:11.550> are

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and how are you still playing it why are

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.630 
and how are you still playing it why are
you<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:12.090> well<00:02:12.270> 90<00:02:12.629> because

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you not well 90 because

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.740 
you not well 90 because
I'm<00:02:13.760> really<00:02:14.060> surprised<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.420> could<00:02:14.569> reach<00:02:14.720> it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
I'm really surprised you could reach it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.970 
I'm really surprised you could reach it
at<00:02:14.960> this<00:02:15.080> point<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:17.200> with<00:02:18.200> these<00:02:18.380> shawls<00:02:18.650> just

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
at this point so with these shawls just

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.090 
at this point so with these shawls just
interrupt<00:02:19.340> their<00:02:19.459> breath<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:20.060> always<00:02:21.100> and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
interrupt their breath like always and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.250 
interrupt their breath like always and
then<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.180> run<00:02:23.420> into<00:02:23.600> another<00:02:23.870> one<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.170> these

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
then we run into another one of these

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.470 
then we run into another one of these
guards<00:02:24.770> just<00:02:25.100> rinse<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.640> repeat<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:26.180> avoid

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
guards just rinse and repeat just avoid

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.809 
guards just rinse and repeat just avoid
the<00:02:26.870> AoE<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.680> do<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.920> little<00:02:28.190> bit<00:02:28.370> better<00:02:28.520> this

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
the AoE I do a little bit better this

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.340 
the AoE I do a little bit better this
time<00:02:28.880> around<00:02:31.330> yeah<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> don't<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.810> don't<00:02:32.840> nearly

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
time around yeah I don't I don't nearly

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.420 
time around yeah I don't I don't nearly
as<00:02:33.440> fail<00:02:33.680> i<00:02:33.709> think<00:02:34.040> i<00:02:34.100> only<00:02:34.190> got<00:02:34.370> hit<00:02:34.520> by<00:02:34.640> one

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
as fail i think i only got hit by one

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.520 
as fail i think i only got hit by one
typically<00:02:37.430> i<00:02:37.760> didn't<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.510> chained<00:02:38.900> once<00:02:39.260> I

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
typically i didn't get chained once I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.920 
typically i didn't get chained once I
don't<00:02:39.709> think<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.790> if<00:02:41.060> your<00:02:41.180> range<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.780> watch

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
don't think so if your range just watch

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.780 
don't think so if your range just watch
out<00:02:42.080> for<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.290> if<00:02:42.830> your<00:02:42.980> melee<00:02:43.280> watch<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.640> for

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
out for that if your melee watch out for

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.850 
out for that if your melee watch out for
the<00:02:43.850> AoE<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:44.540> forgotten<00:02:45.020> King<00:02:45.350> spirit

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
the AoE and this forgotten King spirit

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.330 
the AoE and this forgotten King spirit
he<00:02:46.580> hits<00:02:46.940> pretty<00:02:47.570> hard<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:48.140> he<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.620> owned<00:02:48.830> me

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
he hits pretty hard as he just owned me

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.930 
he hits pretty hard as he just owned me
and<00:02:49.640> my<00:02:49.880> other<00:02:50.180> teammate<00:02:51.130> one<00:02:52.130> stays<00:02:52.370> alive<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and my other teammate one stays alive so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.280 
and my other teammate one stays alive so
we<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.480> still<00:02:53.720> encounter<00:02:56.170> essentially<00:02:57.170> what

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
we can still encounter essentially what

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.690 
we can still encounter essentially what
you<00:02:57.410> need<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.650> know<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.800> didn't<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
you need to know I didn't get it the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.300 
you need to know I didn't get it the
first<00:02:58.730> time<00:02:59.000> around<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.980> need<00:03:01.190> to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
first time around is that you need to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.750 
first time around is that you need to
interrupt<00:03:01.640> his<00:03:02.060> shadow<00:03:02.420> bolt<00:03:02.630> volley<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.440> is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
interrupt his shadow bolt volley that is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.979 
interrupt his shadow bolt volley that is
number<00:03:04.760> one<00:03:04.970> priority<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.660> guy<00:03:05.780> that's

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
number one priority on this guy that's

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.580 
number one priority on this guy that's
really<00:03:06.260> only<00:03:06.440> his<00:03:07.130> only<00:03:07.550> ability<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.590> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
really only his only ability is that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.770 
really only his only ability is that
shadow<00:03:09.860> bolt<00:03:10.070> volley<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.850> will<00:03:11.090> hit<00:03:11.390> you

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
shadow bolt volley but it will hit you

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.160 
shadow bolt volley but it will hit you
for<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.410> lot<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.220> damage<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.269> want<00:03:14.900> to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
for a lot of damage so you want to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.590 
for a lot of damage so you want to
interrupt<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.890> we<00:03:16.040> had<00:03:16.280> two<00:03:16.459> shamans<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.360> it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
interrupt it we had two shamans so it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.640 
interrupt it we had two shamans so it
was<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:18.049> really<00:03:18.470> an<00:03:18.560> issue<00:03:19.510> um<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.570> don't<00:03:21.470> know

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
was not really an issue um I don't know

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.530 
was not really an issue um I don't know
what<00:03:22.100> your<00:03:22.280> group<00:03:22.489> would<00:03:22.610> consist<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:23.510> I

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
what your group would consist of but I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.690 
what your group would consist of but I
know<00:03:23.690> when<00:03:23.989> these<00:03:24.110> hit<00:03:24.380> launch<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:25.280> will<00:03:25.459> need

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
know when these hit launch you will need

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.880 
know when these hit launch you will need
three<00:03:26.239> people<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.750> your<00:03:26.840> party<00:03:27.049> ahead<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.680> time

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
in order to queue for them so you can't

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.170 
in order to queue for them so you can't
just<00:03:30.440> queue<00:03:30.739> for<00:03:30.920> them<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.310> find<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.730> group<00:03:31.880> you

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
just queue for them and find a group you

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.060 
just queue for them and find a group you
need<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> group<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.410> your<00:03:33.530> friends<00:03:33.590> or

some giladhiz get in there and do that

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.580 
some giladhiz get in there and do that
 so<00:03:39.500> as<00:03:39.769> far<00:03:39.950> as<00:03:40.570> that's<00:03:41.570> concerned<00:03:41.810> of

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
 so as far as that's concerned of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.190 
 so as far as that's concerned of
these<00:03:42.980> Quillen<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.480> I'm<00:03:44.570> pronouncing<00:03:44.810> that

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
these Quillen if I'm pronouncing that

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.539 
these Quillen if I'm pronouncing that
right<00:03:46.600> they<00:03:47.600> they<00:03:48.079> do<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.680> exact<00:03:49.040> same<00:03:49.070> things

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
right they they do the exact same things

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.940 
right they they do the exact same things
they<00:03:49.760> just<00:03:49.970> enemies<00:03:50.810> essentially<00:03:51.590> in<00:03:51.769> this

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
they just enemies essentially in this

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
limb uh maybe some gear I doubt it would

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.909 
limb uh maybe some gear I doubt it would
be<00:05:44.780> epic<00:05:44.990> gear<00:05:45.410> but<00:05:45.860> gear<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:47.530> then<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.740> course

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
be epic gear but gear and then of course

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.680 
be epic gear but gear and then of course
you<00:05:49.040> get<00:05:49.160> valor<00:05:49.430> points<00:05:49.669> for<00:05:49.970> completing<00:05:50.540> a

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
you get valor points for completing a

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.940 
you get valor points for completing a
random<00:05:51.140> one<00:05:51.320> so<00:05:52.310> these<00:05:53.150> do<00:05:53.900> require<00:05:54.290> item

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
random one so these do require item

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.200 
random one so these do require item
