00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.730
 cuban is a first generation pokémon 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.529
 this means that he was among the first 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 and 151 pokémon that was possible 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.550
 to catch 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 that's what pokédex says over the years 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 on this pokémon he lost his mother to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.699
 birth and now he wears the skull not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.380
 never showing your appearance 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.750
 the full moon cries that looks very much 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.420
 to the mother when she feels alone spear 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 howling cries because it never washes 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.470
 his skull helmet nobody ever has 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.600
 having seen its true face 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.159
 according to an urban legend 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.900
 spread this little internet 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.269
 tender pokémon than in the beta version 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.489
 American had to call herself orphan by 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.769
 orphan orphan is a puppy 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.839
 I know a lot about cannes gas cannes 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.580
 being completely alone against 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.170
 the world would have had two choices 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.210
 learn to fight or die like this i 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.470
 coupons are nothing but orphans 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.060
 have learned to use the rockets of the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.650
 own parent as weapons for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 to survive 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.079
 below an image that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.880
 its history would explain perfection 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.600
 the urban legend is a lot 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.719
 charming 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.090
 but now some questions arise but the 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.979
 cub cub tanga scam are not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.299
 different 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.740
 actually if we look closely at the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.579
 difference between a puppy of cambiasca 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.770
 leon cuban are very few skin 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.509
 of the brownish cloak unlike 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.299
 the gray one was the puppy but 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.649
 let us consider solitude the two 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.729
 having to fight to live with the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.590
 own forces 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.880
 he could have made his skin more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.469
 resistant 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.359
 in the early pokémon games I was in 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.549
 black and white the colors were not 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.590
 set to perfection for example 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.590
 picasso had a white belly and he was 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 half-striped also caracas canne 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.030
 tending to brown but because they close e 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.340
 should not have evolved into a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.469
 kanga scan according to my humble opinion 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 the weight of the helmet that never rises 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.530
 would be a great reason to 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.969
 justify its evolutionary states 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.180
 different from what you should 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.750
 wait 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.520
 emma logoc that's what the pokédex says but 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.170
 he knows that he evolves from Cuban making himself 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.940
 strong and overcoming mourning for the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.100
 loss of his mother 's soul 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.230
 Forged and tempered is not easy to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.940
 defeat but stuff that is none other than 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.470
 a grown up coupon I learned to 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.850
 fight alone and has become 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.430
 one in symbiosis with the equipment 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.020
 initial indeed unlike 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.450
 the latter which could remove the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 helmet skull at any time but 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.230
 rome that unable to do this for 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.800
 the reason that it is completely 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.880
 fossilized around his skull 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.480
 thus depriving him of a hypothetical 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.040
 evolution in a scan dog but this one 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.230
 urban legend at delle 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.780
 real foundation is completely 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.850
 invented here comes the beauty 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.250
 initially everyone believed that the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.110
 history was completely invented but 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.090
 there were too many coincidences and in fact 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.980
 with long searches of numerous do al 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 about the voices exiting the game 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.780
 freak claimed that initially 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.120
 in beta versions of pokémon rossoblù 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.890
 cuban and kang scan were really 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.230
 related through a pre 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.510
 common evolution is the kang puppy 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.519
 a bench at the last minute, however, were 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.410
 I decided on the changes that made kanga 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.450
 no escape one of the few pokémon devoid of 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.950
 pre volution eliminating the pokémon pre 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.280
 wanted vaud and thus denying the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.989
 kinship with Cuba in this malware 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.790
 it is probably done in order not to create 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 problems on how to make that evolve 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.350
 small pokémon or more precisely how 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.930
 make him fight this elimination of 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.640
 however apparently harmless data created a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.410
 data gap in the game that gave birth 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.239
 to a new creature he would have 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.519
 brought conclusion in everyone's head 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.880
 the fans like no one else ever did 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.250
 before 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.170
 the cancellation of the data in fact gave 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.730
 life to a new pokémon the famous 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.689
 number zero missing no 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.640
 furthermore it is said that there is one 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.159
 similarity between the skull of the Cubans 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.599
 column denounce the Sardinians but this one for 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.599
 now only a hypothesis remains
