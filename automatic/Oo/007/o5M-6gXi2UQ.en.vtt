00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.050
 hi to all 4 for ten days seem to show it 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.299
 on the side of the rhine 5 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.150
 so we will start with 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.989
 then the biggest pot 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.890
 statistics and girls 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.660
 then the next we can see what is cleric 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 so percent it's worse 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.769
 that's done then the banks had to make a sword 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.349
 so it's the sex that starts early so we will complete kutcher 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 then we can see that the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 there are cracks you can kill monsters 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.909
 construction 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.909
 in the meantime a cow you have a new challenge 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.410
 these statements 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.050
 they then paraded in a setting of other measures like a little rope 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.090
 who appear 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.360
 side of the wall 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.620
 we only have tony 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.440
 use 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.160
 it stops here so all at the hbo series and whenever you in 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.010
 besides won others in canada which for example did not exactly mans 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.670
 but he must see her 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.120
 so we will start 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 already done 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 so I'm going to do my little foot challenge and two planets 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.690
 and so when I do 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690
 a fashion show I'm here 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.400
 he knows that the challenge was very proud 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.210
 but when I continually tackle this activity and it's new challenge that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.079
 appear 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.710
 line of August 15th 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.320
 and to do 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 and first of all the word of cash then 7% to 5 26% in the same extreme mold 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.440
 and statistics 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.610
 so when I am told that i will be holder b the time you played the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.140
 world 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.330
 the world you have made the world is watching how to dress 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 the number of things that 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.649
 so the podium different things more or less interesting 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.189
 how far you have traveled on a free kick on a boat 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.539
 the damage you did tomorrow that you did not kill 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.430
 otherwise it is usually in bulk then that you have the statistics of 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.430
 each block so on the side of his block foolishness 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:32.189
 here is the number of times you missed it so I practice for the 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.649
 wood here these worlds as used so that ask 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.389
 and here is the number of times to help they had destroyed a 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.389
 mosque or abbey 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.099
 so it's here it's the same thing but for your 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.599
 gold the system 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.909
 so when we were so I ask when will I destroy 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.199
 it's a little over six hours maximum 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.249
 here it's the world think I'm going to crack and just so many times that I 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.289
 have a little novelty of this update 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.299
 capped the scales 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.709
 it's not the scales quiberon we put back so missed a single evening 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 with one-time sticks you have two scales 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.829
 and so it only stays in 1 7% new kraft technique 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.859
 you surely have what had ladders in the narrow lanes 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.189
 now composed of water and torque rise ladders like this 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.079
 we could not go up 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.549
 so the only solution 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.299
 it's like doing that 2 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.429
 here 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.799
 presentation marked mention that the point of less than lille 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.879
 now it's possible I'll spend a lot easier than it is at 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.879
 to say that it comes back before the accountant is expensive 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.429
 It's with 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.760
 in it is really amused pointed 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.089
 baylet with afp 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.959
 another small novelty rather interesting is when you use 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.959
 a safe as an object on the hit capital key 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.039
 the attacked must change the object is moving matignon 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.549
 in the body 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.439
 and so to the inverted 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.069
 ngt in the trunk this bitch and this one is automatically lifted from 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.139
 body 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.539
 now according to the blog the color of the earth will be different
