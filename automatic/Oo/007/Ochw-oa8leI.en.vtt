00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 where people what me sandal i am 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.740
 basin today we are going to be able to pina 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.450
 have it made and is it without alcohol and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.200
 that's why it's the pina colada 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.610
 let's go let you start this whatever you like 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.190
 all needed for this drink and that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.780
 namely this time it is an alias 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.859
 thea but they can not otherwise fresh 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 you can always find it from nick 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.420
 and to Chad was smart enough 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.189
 not a can opener 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 as they sell it can sometimes melt 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 find a package or in a dip 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.349
 crushed ice is temporary and slightly 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.599
 press to cut the other and one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.890
 strange and when we start it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 drink 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 first nature to do is the other 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.879
 so grab your lennox and take it 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 packet of bread or 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.059
 or if you reach and of course not 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.780
 used more and to be the first to cut 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.329
 the top off job that lay on his 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.149
 save it for later as the decoration 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.649
 waiting for you were here 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 and then you go long the debt as 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.680
 cutting ensure it to be off all those 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 use pieces just as we are 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 against your tongue and scrape and then elio 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.600
 not entirely from each side 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.549
 innocent 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.549
 So I then a bit of cropping 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.119
 and findable make sure you 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.530
 hands have washed nature 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.479
 of course do not forget to dry the soil 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.380
 pick up then you might be better 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.750
 start 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 do shave throw again and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.939
 start cutting your films first 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 through inside so down 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.509
 yes I need but then 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.619
 once again 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.770
 half or one of the main 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.079
 is that I feel this piece we are going to feel this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.730
 the hard thing is just not to eat 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.030
 can be my core 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.030
 score 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.050
 and then yes this is quite a lot i like people 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.860
 with other pieces you also get man and 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.870
 middle part 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.580
 said and then we go neighborhood 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.460
 like cutting a piece just small 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:01.270
 pieces of blocks know what I want to do and 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.130
 the other also fixed and then different 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 the family also is of course the ones in the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.960
 always on and you throw idea 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.370
 hello and on your hand for a moment and then 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.140
 still sing then grab the cockles oh and 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.790
 buy and come through your can 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.790
 made that previously cooked with me too 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.870
 and hang out for other saske 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.260
 song while 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.420
 about 300 milliliters in a half 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.420
 pineapple and then you joined 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.320
 all over the floor but that makes it 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.590
 not out and the text on it we go 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.590
 blending 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.850
 and that they are most important of course taxi 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.410
 has forgotten but you remained the substance 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.570
 is completely liquid and also a go 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.390
 so give it to a little glass 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.390
 glass depends on it and donates danny 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.770
 then makes that brand and of course 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.050
 do a little bit of attention to the side 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.820
 I print the pina colada and then the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:10.690
 favorite moment test can 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:10.690
 expect people to be so dry 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.920
 fries but really nice tropical 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.510
 microphone tropical and that is how delicious it is 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.590
 so I got it on the floor at once 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.590
 but luckily I have more 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.760
