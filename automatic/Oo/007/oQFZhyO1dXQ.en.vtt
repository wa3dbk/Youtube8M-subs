00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.520
 Welcome to cooking step by step today 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.520
 I'm going to show you how to prepare these 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.520
 delicious strawberry villages or ice cream 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.570
 stick as we say in Argentina 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.300
 these are the ingredients that I'm going to 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.300
 use 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 and the strawberries because it is convenient to use them 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 now since it's season 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.190
 I'm going to start cleaning strawberries well 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 cutting them in the middle removing the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 little green leaves 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.250
 and I'm going to cut a slice of strawberry from 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.080
 half centimeter 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.930
 approximately for each side but as 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.730
 I have altogether 8 or ice creams are two 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.620
 molds of 4 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.620
 short 48 total 86 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.670
 and then 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.680
 you have to liquefy the dams 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.610
 this container of total strawberries of medium 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 kilos and 500 grams 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.319
 we have to go rather if we already have the 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.319
 liquefied weights 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.540
 I'm going to place the strawberry slices that 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.680
 I cut before one inside each mold and 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.860
 as you see already pressing a little 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.150
 they stick together I'll put it in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.500
 the freezer so that they fit 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.000
 stuck and then do not come out and while 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 I will put water to boil with the sugar 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.050
 to brown sugar approximately from 6 to 8 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 spoonfuls 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.800
 I am using this brown sugar 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.660
 dear a little color as you see when you 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.660
 he did what is a prettier color 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.289
 once it boils we let it cool 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.880
 and we add it to the crushed strawberry that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.880
 we had mixed well 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.520
 and once we finish mixing 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.770
 I will quickly go to fill the molds 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.810
 I've taken them out of the freezer as 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 come in the slice of strawberry or slice of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.250
 strawberry that does not move from there 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.220
 and as I said quickly fill the mold 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.380
 put the covers and take it to the freezer 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.740
 and the covers as you see have a little tube in 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.150
 the side that serves so that when 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.930
 Freeze the liquid 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.189
 it expands a little and good if too much 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.189
 will go out there by the tube 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.730
 and so to the freezer I'm going to leave it 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.830
 about 24 hours a day for the other 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.330
 but for that a little less with 4 hours 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 6 hours would be fine 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 and to disassemble with a little water 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.420
 hot a few seconds 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.609
 yes 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.430
 either red and it will go very well already 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.620
 we have the strawberry ice cream ready 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.819
 they look very good looking very good color 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.819
 and they remain super rich 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.120
 I hope they are so good and 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.390
 Well, you know if they like to give
