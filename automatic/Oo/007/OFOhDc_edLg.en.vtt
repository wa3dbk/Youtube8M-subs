her life there

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.860 
her life there
or<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.910> colostomy<00:02:15.910> was<00:02:16.150> superior<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.780> the

same thing applies to a woman giving
birth<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.300> doctor<00:02:19.690> would<00:02:19.810> never<00:02:20.230> damage<00:02:20.710> that

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
birth a doctor would never damage that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.370 
birth a doctor would never damage that
area<00:02:21.340> because<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.030> very<00:02:22.240> hard<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.810> repair

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
area because it's very hard to repair

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.790 
area because it's very hard to repair
the<00:02:24.130> muscles<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.690> simply<00:02:26.530> an

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
the muscles so it is just simply an

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.590 
the muscles so it is just simply an
incision<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.580> could<00:02:27.730> be<00:02:27.910> either<00:02:28.150> towards

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
incision and it could be either towards

incision and it could be either towards
the<00:02:28.780> front<00:02:29.110> or<00:02:29.380> generally<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.550> though

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the front or generally it is though

should only be done as a
last<00:04:27.759> resort<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.979> don't<00:04:30.879> think<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
last resort and I don't think the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.899 
last resort and I don't think the
majority<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.599> OB<00:04:31.870> gyns<00:04:32.289> are<00:04:32.379> evil<00:04:32.740> at<00:04:33.580> least<00:04:33.729> in

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
majority of OB gyns are evil at least in

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.570 
majority of OB gyns are evil at least in
Canada<00:04:34.419> and<00:04:34.629> I<00:04:34.780> don't<00:04:34.990> think<00:04:35.259> they<00:04:35.919> all<00:04:36.189> try<00:04:36.520> to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
Canada and I don't think they all try to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.999 
Canada and I don't think they all try to
speed<00:04:36.909> up<00:04:36.939> the<00:04:37.060> birthing<00:04:37.419> process<00:04:37.449> though

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
speed up the birthing process though

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.010 
speed up the birthing process though
admittedly<00:04:39.009> i<00:04:39.250> was<00:04:39.610> given<00:04:39.879> pitocin<00:04:40.539> which<00:04:40.900> is

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
admittedly i was given pitocin which is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.230 
admittedly i was given pitocin which is
a<00:04:41.050> hormone<00:04:41.439> to<00:04:41.620> speed<00:04:42.370> up<00:04:42.460> your<00:04:42.580> contractions

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
a hormone to speed up your contractions

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.890 
a hormone to speed up your contractions
and<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:45.340> actually<00:04:45.610> increased<00:04:46.060> my<00:04:46.240> pain<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:46.569> I

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
and it actually increased my pain and I

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.929 
and it actually increased my pain and I
think<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.740> would<00:04:48.460> have<00:04:48.550> been<00:04:48.669> able<00:04:48.789> to

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
think that I would have been able to

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:50.700 
think that I would have been able to
have<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.330> natural<00:04:49.719> childbirth<00:04:50.169> without<00:04:50.349> an

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
have a natural childbirth without an

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.820 
have a natural childbirth without an
epidural<00:04:51.099> had<00:04:51.909> I<00:04:52.360> not<00:04:52.930> been<00:04:52.990> given<00:04:53.349> pitocin

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
epidural had I not been given pitocin

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.399 
epidural had I not been given pitocin
but<00:04:54.460> ultimately<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.419> know<00:04:55.539> my<00:04:55.689> son<00:04:55.930> was<00:04:56.169> born

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
but ultimately you know my son was born

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.170 
but ultimately you know my son was born
and<00:04:56.680> he<00:04:56.919> was<00:04:57.099> fine<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:59.039> yeah<00:05:00.039> I<00:05:00.520> only<00:05:00.819> had<00:05:01.060> to

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
and he was fine and yeah I only had to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.269 
and he was fine and yeah I only had to
push<00:05:01.389> for<00:05:01.599> I<00:05:01.629> think<00:05:01.870> like<00:05:01.990> 30<00:05:02.289> minutes<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.129> yeah

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
push for I think like 30 minutes so yeah

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.529 
push for I think like 30 minutes so yeah
I<00:05:03.310> just<00:05:03.580> wanted<00:05:03.759> to<00:05:03.819> clear<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.060> up<00:05:04.270> because

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
about the birthing process and that they

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.610 
about the birthing process and that they
brought<00:05:32.710> young<00:05:33.509> teenagers<00:05:34.509> into<00:05:34.930> delivery
