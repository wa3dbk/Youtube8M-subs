00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.210
 we are here before the very first work 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.930
 what we show each other first courses 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.480
 from 1980 still a student for a long time 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.830
 student of the academy in dÃ¼sseldorf and 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.570
 Picture shows there perhaps where he 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.640
 comes from the mug school that is 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.690
 what he emptied at bernd mug 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.310
 this very objective has learned 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.320
 We are already working on photography 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.510
 what your own doing with it completely 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.490
 Absolutely burning all three 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.560
 flames on with full throttle is from the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.370
 picture very own absurd 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.770
 character 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.560
 that's what makes something of that kind of thing 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.480
 own one as it would be all 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.790
 Note this factuality 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.890
 contradicting makes the picture with it 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.890
 an exciting and also enigmatic 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.720
 So we show here pictures from almost 30 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.170
 years and the exciting was with andreas 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.430
 gursky the exhibition quasi of today 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.950
 to develop 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.300
 we are showing a whole new work here 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.700
 Qatar from 2012 and from this point of view 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.600
 We then have new away groups with him 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.810
 or he has for us from the world, a 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.690
 quasi the measure selection now are there 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.260
 bring the works of emma together 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.000
 I wanted to be away from them for almost 30 years 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.650
 the very early ones 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.120
 snapshots are that 's it too 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.040
 right up to this very virtuoso and whole 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.880
 as strictly composed as it was for him 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.880
 Example tattages 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.400
 how will be staged who will art in 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.400
 network 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.430
 Well
