00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.439

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.449

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.990

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.369
 After 5 seconds of advertising already 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.070

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.869
 excellent topic of course my blog is going to 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.600

 good before leaving them with a view 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.100
 I want to show you what would be 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.280
 this part of here is part of who 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 the theme has been edited in its color 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.830
 original the ok if the red is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.809
 network and well I took the trouble of 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.900
 edit it myself in its color that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.000
 edited me the blue 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.790
 so also the administrator of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.470
 tasks has it edited so that it looks 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 much better what is the theme and more

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.800
 tasks also among other things that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.790
