00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.560 

as<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.759> we're<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:38.969> moving<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
as you can see we're just moving the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.169 
as you can see we're just moving the
hooks<00:01:39.979> as<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.399> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.030> moving

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
hooks as you can see we're just moving

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.569 
hooks as you can see we're just moving
left<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.719> right<00:01:45.799> this<00:01:46.799> also<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.460> an

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
left and right this also has an

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
left and right this also has an
accelerometer<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.200> recommend

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
accelerometer but I don't recommend

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.529 
accelerometer but I don't recommend
playing<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.280> game<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.880> accelerometer

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
playing this game with the accelerometer

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.160 
playing this game with the accelerometer
as<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.319> ridiculously<00:01:52.710> tough<00:01:54.170> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
as it is just ridiculously tough it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
as it is just ridiculously tough it's
almost<00:01:55.409> too<00:01:55.679> much<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.039> lag<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.280> order<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.759> be

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
almost too much of a lag in order to be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.469 
almost too much of a lag in order to be
able<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> actually<00:01:57.240> make<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.689> work<00:01:57.840> correctly

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
able to actually make it work correctly

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.550 
able to actually make it work correctly
this<00:02:00.479> way<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:01.409> actually

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this way all I have to do is actually

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139 
this way all I have to do is actually
just<00:02:01.799> touch<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> left<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:02.610> sides<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
just touch the left and right sides of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.690 
just touch the left and right sides of
the<00:02:03.209> string<00:02:03.569> which<00:02:03.810> makes<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.549> little<00:02:05.549> bit

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the string which makes it a little bit

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.100 
the string which makes it a little bit
more<00:02:05.850> bearable<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.689> you're<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.959> up

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
more bearable and you're going up

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.479 
more bearable and you're going up
against<00:02:07.380> obstacles<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> can

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
against obstacles like this and you can

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.490 
against obstacles like this and you can
see<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:11.760> crazy<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.260> give<00:02:13.380> you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
see how crazy it is and it can give you
