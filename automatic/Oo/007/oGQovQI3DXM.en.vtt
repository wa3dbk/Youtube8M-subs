end but it's very it was a very good
quality<00:00:40.399> because<00:00:41.399> I'd<00:00:41.489> already<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:41.910> my

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
quality because I'd already put my

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.250 
quality because I'd already put my
tripod<00:00:42.300> away<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.440> anyway<00:00:43.890> um<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:45.360> hall<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
tripod away so anyway um do hall for you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.220 
tripod away so anyway um do hall for you
guys<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:51.050> these<00:00:52.050> are

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
guys that don't know it has these are

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
guys that don't know it has these are
the<00:00:52.320> pieces<00:00:55.340> nothing<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> special

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the pieces nothing much to special

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
the pieces nothing much to special
bottom<00:00:57.420> except<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.129> fit<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
bottom except for that they fit all the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
bottom except for that they fit all the
way<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> queue<00:01:07.729> okay<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.510> yeah<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:10.200> fit

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
way in the queue okay so yeah they fit

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.580 
way in the queue okay so yeah they fit
together<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:16.350> fit

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
together like that and then they fit

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
together like that and then they fit
right<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> core<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:18.630> very

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
right into the core so there's very

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
right into the core so there's very
little<00:01:19.080> space<00:01:19.830> inside<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> cube<00:01:22.670> once<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
little space inside the cube once the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840 
little space inside the cube once the
pieces<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> making<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.490> hard<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pieces are in making it hard to get the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.749 
pieces are in making it hard to get the
pieces<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.790> harder<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:29.970> pops<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.759> could

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
pieces out to harder for pops and could

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
pieces out to harder for pops and could
when<00:01:32.970> moving<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> move<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> with

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
when moving it so when you move it with

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.630 
when moving it so when you move it with
Rubik's<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.409> put<00:01:37.409> lubick<00:01:37.860> saan<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> core

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
Rubik's you put lubick saan the core

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
Rubik's you put lubick saan the core
where<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.939> pieces<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:42.710> pieces<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
where the pieces and the pieces in the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.660 
where the pieces and the pieces in the
core<00:01:44.250> edges<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.329> quorums<00:01:45.930> touch<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> put<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
core edges are quorums touch so I put it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.130 
core edges are quorums touch so I put it
right<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:49.340> right<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:51.079> that<00:01:52.079> little

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
right there the right there that little

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.789 
right there the right there that little
little<00:01:53.000> bit<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:56.030> center<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.560> put<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
little bit for the center on and I put a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
little bit for the center on and I put a
little<00:01:58.950> dot<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.340> each<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.780> dot

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
little dot on each and then one dot

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.249 
little dot on each and then one dot
right<00:02:02.570> here<00:02:03.710> on<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.640> screen<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.780> on

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
right here on the screen right here on

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
right here on the screen right here on
this<00:02:07.380> piece<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.670> you'll<00:02:08.819> insert<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
this piece and then you'll insert the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.490 
this piece and then you'll insert the
last<00:02:09.450> piece

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
last piece

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.030 
last piece
scramble<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:12.240> not<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.950> its<00:02:16.040> previously

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
scramble it to not on its previously

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.150 
scramble it to not on its previously
amazing<00:02:17.550> though<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:19.610> had<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.840> 23-point<00:02:22.160> 73

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
amazing though I had a 23-point 73
