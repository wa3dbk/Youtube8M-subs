goggles<00:00:06.120> which<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:06.450> really<00:00:06.660> cheap<00:00:06.870> there<00:00:07.170> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
goggles which are really cheap there I

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.730 
goggles which are really cheap there I
think<00:00:07.980> they're<00:00:08.610> $30<00:00:09.360> plus<00:00:09.870> postage<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.500> paid

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
think they're $30 plus postage I paid

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.370 
think they're $30 plus postage I paid
twenty<00:00:11.700> four<00:00:11.880> pounds<00:00:12.090> delivered<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.049> they

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
twenty four pounds delivered and they

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.039 
twenty four pounds delivered and they
come<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.130> flat<00:00:14.670> box<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.059> pieces<00:00:15.509> I've<00:00:15.750> put

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
come in a flat box in pieces I've put

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.820 
come in a flat box in pieces I've put
them<00:00:16.199> together<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.820> screen<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.740> it's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
them together the screen is I think it's

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830 
them together the screen is I think it's
really<00:00:19.980> good<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.430> money<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.660> pop

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
really good for the money and I just pop

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.220 
really good for the money and I just pop
up

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
up

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.230 
up
there's<00:00:22.439> playing<00:00:22.680> an<00:00:23.039> old<00:00:23.189> DVD<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:24.090> because

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
there's playing an old DVD just because

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
there's playing an old DVD just because
it's<00:00:24.390> easier<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> show<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.470> quality<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it's easier to show the quality of the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
it's easier to show the quality of the
screen<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.090> screen<00:00:27.359> looks<00:00:27.510> absolutely

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
screen but the screen looks absolutely

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.550 
screen but the screen looks absolutely
fine

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
fine

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.580 
fine
the<00:00:28.949> foam<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.119> nicely<00:00:30.510> moulded<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the foam is really nicely moulded you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
the foam is really nicely moulded you
put<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> together<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.369> simply<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.120> couple<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
put it together very simply a couple of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.650 
put it together very simply a couple of
tips<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.170> would<00:00:34.290> say<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.920> used<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.520> super<00:00:36.480> glue

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
tips I would say I used them super glue

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.160 
tips I would say I used them super glue
to<00:00:36.960> glue<00:00:37.739> these<00:00:38.010> little<00:00:38.309> tabs<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.020> do

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to glue these little tabs on if you do

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
to glue these little tabs on if you do
that<00:00:40.350> leave<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> frame<00:00:41.160> overnight<00:00:41.790> before

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that leave the frame overnight before

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.049 
that leave the frame overnight before
you<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.260> foam<00:00:44.040> goggles<00:00:44.640> because

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you put it in the foam goggles because

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
you put it in the foam goggles because
the<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.289> mist<00:00:46.620> from<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> super<00:00:47.190> glue<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.520> get

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the the mist from the super glue you get

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150 
the the mist from the super glue you get
this<00:00:47.789> sort<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> white<00:00:48.300> mist<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> settles<00:00:50.039> on

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
this sort of white mist that settles on

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
this sort of white mist that settles on
everything<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.270> around<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> frame

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
everything it was all around the frame

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.979 
everything it was all around the frame
of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> screen<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:52.920> I've<00:00:53.070> cleaned<00:00:53.309> off<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
of the screen which I've cleaned off and

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
of the screen which I've cleaned off and
so<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.230> something<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.309> which<00:00:56.489> was

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so just something not to do which was

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
so just something not to do which was
silly<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.879> me<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:58.070> foam<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.579> glued<00:00:59.820> together

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
silly of me the foam I've glued together

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.650 
silly of me the foam I've glued together
with<00:01:00.180> P<00:01:00.480> o<00:01:00.510> R<00:01:00.770> which<00:01:01.770> went<00:01:01.980> together<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
with P o R which went together really is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.820 
with P o R which went together really is
easily<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.780> I've<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> foam<00:01:04.350> strips<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
easily and I've got the foam strips in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.490 
easily and I've got the foam strips in
whichever<00:01:05.070> focus<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:07.049> there's<00:01:07.320> some

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
whichever focus thing that there's some

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850 
whichever focus thing that there's some
little<00:01:07.860> self<00:01:08.189> adhesive<00:01:08.549> foam<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.680> can

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
little self adhesive foam that you can

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.640 
little self adhesive foam that you can
put<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.729> fit<00:01:11.970> around<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.360> face

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
put on to make it fit around your face

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.929 
put on to make it fit around your face
people<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.860> contained<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> no<00:01:14.580> slot

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
people have contained about the no slot

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
people have contained about the no slot
but<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.330> must<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> normal<00:01:16.229> nose<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
but I must have a normal nose because it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.140 
but I must have a normal nose because it
seems<00:01:17.189> fine<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.700> me<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:19.610> tips<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.790> would<00:01:20.850> give

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
seems fine for me the tips I would give

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
seems fine for me the tips I would give
our<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> super<00:01:22.229> glue<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.740> then

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
our one is if you super glue this then

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.499 
our one is if you super glue this then
to<00:01:23.400> leave<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.670> overnight<00:01:23.850> before<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to leave it overnight before you put it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.170 
to leave it overnight before you put it
in<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.530> housing<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.820> other<00:01:26.970> thing

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in there in the housing the other thing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
in there in the housing the other thing
is<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> tabs<00:01:27.810> come<00:01:28.140> quite<00:01:28.470> long<00:01:28.729> which<00:01:29.729> means

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
is the tabs come quite long which means

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.039 
is the tabs come quite long which means
you<00:01:30.030> can't<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.780> once

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you can't get them in and out once

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.630 
you can't get them in and out once
you've<00:01:31.200> glued<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> foam<00:01:31.979> together<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.520> what

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you've glued the foam together so what

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
you've glued the foam together so what
I've<00:01:32.759> done<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.939> I've<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.210> dremeled<00:01:33.720> these

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
I've done is I've just dremeled these

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
I've done is I've just dremeled these
down<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.920> uh<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.729> about

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
down so they just uh I think know about

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
down so they just uh I think know about
seventeen<00:01:36.810> mil<00:01:37.159> let's<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.400> check<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.770> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
seventeen mil let's just check that so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.670 
seventeen mil let's just check that so
yeah<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.280> seventeen<00:01:42.060> mil

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
yeah they're about seventeen mil

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.600 
yeah they're about seventeen mil
protruding<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.189> rounded<00:01:44.549> them

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
protruding and I've just rounded them

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.139 
protruding and I've just rounded them
off<00:01:44.759> slightly

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
off slightly

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.499 
off slightly
now<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.140> tip<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.950> pot<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:48.060> masking

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
now the other tip is to pot use masking

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
now the other tip is to pot use masking
tape<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.899> hold<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.259> lens<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
tape to hold the little lens on the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
tape to hold the little lens on the
Fresnel<00:01:51.090> lens<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.079> means<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
Fresnel lens and that means that you can

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.670 
Fresnel lens and that means that you can
then<00:01:53.100> slot<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> goggles<00:01:54.930> like

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
then slot this in to the goggles like

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.749 
then slot this in to the goggles like
that<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.360> adjust<00:01:57.750> now<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.040> I've<00:01:59.369> tried

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that and then adjust now the I've tried

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
that and then adjust now the I've tried
the<00:01:59.909> lens<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.240> net<00:02:00.420> bit<00:02:00.600> odd<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.020> mid<00:02:01.229> I'm

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the lens is net bit odd the mid I'm

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
the lens is net bit odd the mid I'm
using<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> middle<00:02:01.920> lens<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
using the middle lens and I'm going to

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.670 
using the middle lens and I'm going to
try<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.659> give<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.899> view<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> looks

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
try and give you a view of what it looks

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.809 
try and give you a view of what it looks
like<00:02:05.390> which<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.420> hard<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.079> do<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.759> I'm<00:02:08.759> not

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
like which is hard to do but I'm not

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.040 
like which is hard to do but I'm not
sure<00:02:09.060> about<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> focus<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> can't

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sure about the focus because you can't

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.390 
sure about the focus because you can't
really<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> camera<00:02:10.709> screen<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
really see on the camera screen but that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640 
really see on the camera screen but that
is<00:02:11.640> roughly

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
is roughly

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.230 
is roughly
what<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.800> looks<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.370> edges<00:02:15.940> are<00:02:16.090> quite

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
what it looks like the edges are quite

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.040 
what it looks like the edges are quite
curved<00:02:17.070> which<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.490> bit<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> funny<00:02:19.300> look

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
curved which is a bit of a funny look

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.920 
curved which is a bit of a funny look
I'm<00:02:20.740> used<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.310> fat<00:02:21.670> shot<00:02:21.880> goggles<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.390> if

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
I'm used to the fat shot goggles so if

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.510 
I'm used to the fat shot goggles so if
you've<00:02:23.080> never<00:02:23.230> used<00:02:23.350> goggles<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.610> fine<00:02:24.990> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
you've never used goggles it's fine the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.590 
you've never used goggles it's fine the
moving<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.550> lens<00:02:27.730> back<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.150> forward<00:02:28.480> is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
moving the lens back and forward is

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.840 
moving the lens back and forward is
supposedly<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.260> focus<00:02:29.590> but<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.100> me<00:02:30.280> there's<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
supposedly for focus but to me there's a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.360 
supposedly for focus but to me there's a
very<00:02:31.120> narrow<00:02:31.390> range<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:32.170> actual<00:02:32.500> focus<00:02:32.680> cavity

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
very narrow range of actual focus cavity

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.950 
very narrow range of actual focus cavity
too<00:02:33.430> far<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.060> see<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> frame<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
too far out you can see the frame in the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.320 
too far out you can see the frame in the
way<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.470> if<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.430> too<00:02:36.610> far<00:02:36.940> up

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
way like that if you have it too far up

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.480 
way like that if you have it too far up
then<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.740> pictured<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.250> sort<00:02:39.460> of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
then the the pictured is sort of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.430 
then the the pictured is sort of
distorts<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.930> sort<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.230> end<00:02:41.320> up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
distorts of it so you sort of end up

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.200 
distorts of it so you sort of end up
with<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.680> about<00:02:41.920> two-thirds<00:02:42.550> back<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:42.850> would

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
with it about two-thirds back I would

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.820 
with it about two-thirds back I would
say<00:02:43.240> um<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.540> picture<00:02:46.900> looks<00:02:47.080> fine<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
say um it the picture looks fine and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.040 
say um it the picture looks fine and
they're<00:02:48.550> very<00:02:48.760> light<00:02:49.120> they<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.360> was<00:02:49.750> worried

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
they're very light they I was worried

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.140 
they're very light they I was worried
they'd<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.200> heavy<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.830> uncomfortable<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
they'd be heavy and uncomfortable to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.850 
they'd be heavy and uncomfortable to
wear<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:52.720> they're<00:02:52.870> fine<00:02:53.140> they've<00:02:53.440> really

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
wear but they're fine they've really

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.280 
wear but they're fine they've really
lightweight<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:55.360> cable<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.810> comes<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.080> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
lightweight the cable that comes with is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.610 
lightweight the cable that comes with is
very<00:02:56.650> neat<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.340> has<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.690> video<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.260> audio<00:02:59.500> in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
very neat it has a video in the audio in

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.310 
very neat it has a video in the audio in
I<00:02:59.920> guess<00:03:00.490> you<00:03:00.610> don't<00:03:00.730> use<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:02.110> little

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
I guess you don't use and the little

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.760 
I guess you don't use and the little
power<00:03:02.530> socket<00:03:04.080> alright<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.260> comes<00:03:05.470> with<00:03:05.650> this

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
power socket alright it comes with this

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.730 
power socket alright it comes with this
adaptor<00:03:06.190> lead<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.660> jst<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.470> I'm<00:03:08.590> just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
adaptor lead to a jst so I'm just

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.680 
adaptor lead to a jst so I'm just
running<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.100> off<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.310> little<00:03:09.400> 3<00:03:09.760> cell<00:03:10.030> at<00:03:10.210> 8:50

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
running it off a little 3 cell at 8:50

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.530 
running it off a little 3 cell at 8:50
pack<00:03:10.870> I've<00:03:11.830> also<00:03:12.040> tried<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.550> on<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.880> sell<00:03:13.210> a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
pack I've also tried it on a to sell a

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.050 
pack I've also tried it on a to sell a
pack<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.800> I've<00:03:14.890> got<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.580> just<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.880> five

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
pack that I've got that it's just a five

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.550 
pack that I've got that it's just a five
and<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.240> half<00:03:16.360> mil<00:03:16.540> 2.1<00:03:17.080> barrel<00:03:17.380> connector

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
and a half mil 2.1 barrel connector

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.020 
and a half mil 2.1 barrel connector
because<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> same<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> fat<00:03:18.820> shot

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
because it's the same as the fat shot

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.270 
because it's the same as the fat shot
goggles<00:03:19.390> use<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:20.080> once<00:03:20.260> fine<00:03:20.500> onto<00:03:20.800> us<00:03:20.920> as<00:03:21.070> well

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
goggles use it once fine onto us as well

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.800 
goggles use it once fine onto us as well
and<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.940> don't<00:03:22.000> know<00:03:22.330> what<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.630> current

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and I don't know what the current

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.360 
and I don't know what the current
consumption<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:23.740> I'm<00:03:23.950> guessing<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.340> a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
consumption is but I'm guessing it's a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.680 
consumption is but I'm guessing it's a
bit<00:03:24.520> higher<00:03:24.700> than<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.970> fat<00:03:25.180> child<00:03:25.390> goggles

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
bit higher than the fat child goggles

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.050 
bit higher than the fat child goggles
just<00:03:25.720> as<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.020> screens<00:03:26.380> bigger<00:03:26.590> but<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.460> 24

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
just as a screens bigger but for 24

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.150 
just as a screens bigger but for 24
pounds<00:03:28.480> it's<00:03:28.600> an<00:03:28.750> absolute<00:03:29.230> bargain<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.830> would

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
pounds it's an absolute bargain I would

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.790 
pounds it's an absolute bargain I would
say<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:31.630> get<00:03:31.840> one<00:03:32.020> it's<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.260> spare<00:03:32.530> set<00:03:32.770> of

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
say just get one it's a spare set of

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.490 
say just get one it's a spare set of
goggles<00:03:32.980> with<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.970> fat<00:03:34.240> child<00:03:34.480> goggles<00:03:34.870> you

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
goggles with the fat child goggles you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.030 
goggles with the fat child goggles you
they<00:03:36.010> come<00:03:36.220> with<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.460> video<00:03:37.180> lead<00:03:37.600> which<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.650> for

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
they come with a video lead which is for

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.220 
they come with a video lead which is for
either<00:03:39.520> video<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:40.090> or<00:03:40.360> video<00:03:40.660> out<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.080> if<00:03:41.140> you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
either video in or video out so if you

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.500 
either video in or video out so if you
have<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.530> goggles<00:03:41.740> normally<00:03:42.430> on<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
have the goggles normally on with the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.330 
have the goggles normally on with the
picture<00:03:44.140> sharing<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.590> using<00:03:44.740> their<00:03:44.950> internal

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
picture sharing and using their internal

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.310 
picture sharing and using their internal
receiver<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.240> just<00:03:46.390> plug<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.870> cable

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
receiver if you just plug in this cable

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.280 
receiver if you just plug in this cable
and<00:03:47.560> then<00:03:47.710> plug<00:03:47.740> this<00:03:48.220> yellow<00:03:48.550> lead<00:03:48.840> into<00:03:49.840> this

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
and then plug this yellow lead into this

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.280 
and then plug this yellow lead into this
yellow<00:03:50.560> lead<00:03:50.860> on<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:52.120> these<00:03:52.510> quantum

yellow lead on the on these quantum

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.140 
yellow lead on the on these quantum
goggles<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:54.040> can<00:03:54.250> then<00:03:54.400> have<00:03:54.550> two<00:03:54.940> screens

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
goggles you can then have two screens

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.940 
goggles you can then have two screens
running<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:56.020> which<00:03:56.170> I've<00:03:56.290> tested<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.800> works

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
running so which I've tested it works

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.110 
running so which I've tested it works
perfectly<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.180> see<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.790> can<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.090> a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
perfectly so you can see you can have a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.450 
perfectly so you can see you can have a
passenger<00:04:01.480> up<00:04:01.720> standing<00:04:02.200> next<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:03.160> they

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
passenger up standing next to and they

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.400 
passenger up standing next to and they
can<00:04:03.520> see<00:04:03.760> what<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.060> can<00:04:04.210> see<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:05.050> other<00:04:05.200> thing

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
can see what you can see the other thing

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.290 
can see what you can see the other thing
I<00:04:05.500> thought<00:04:05.650> would<00:04:05.770> be<00:04:05.860> quite<00:04:06.070> useful<00:04:06.250> be<00:04:06.610> to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
I thought would be quite useful be to

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.710 
I thought would be quite useful be to
somehow<00:04:07.630> mount<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.140> somehow<00:04:09.600> possibly<00:04:10.600> even

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
somehow mount this somehow possibly even

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.590 
somehow mount this somehow possibly even
leave<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.080> lens<00:04:11.260> out<00:04:11.560> just<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.520> serve<00:04:13.120> as<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
leave the lens out just to serve as a

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.970 
leave the lens out just to serve as a
screen<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.260> easily<00:04:14.680> look<00:04:14.800> at

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
screen that you can easily look at

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.010 
screen that you can easily look at
without<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> Sun<00:04:15.550> getting<00:04:15.820> in<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.000> way<00:04:16.150> so

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
without the Sun getting in the way so

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.349 
without the Sun getting in the way so
you<00:04:17.080> can<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:18.010> could<00:04:18.130> just<00:04:18.340> literally<00:04:19.030> have<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
you can you could just literally have it

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.780 
you can you could just literally have it
I<00:04:19.570> want<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.109> stand<00:04:20.320> like<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:20.799> if<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.340> hood

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
I want to stand like this if this hood

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.000 
I want to stand like this if this hood
makes<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.150> really<00:04:22.360> nice<00:04:22.540> Sun<00:04:22.840> shield<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.410> for

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
makes a really nice Sun shield and for

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.200 
makes a really nice Sun shield and for
if<00:04:24.100> you're<00:04:24.220> doing<00:04:24.370> a

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
if you're doing a

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.360 
if you're doing a
a<00:04:25.500> line-of-sight<00:04:26.500> flight<00:04:26.860> we<00:04:27.039> just<00:04:27.190> want<00:04:27.310> to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
a line-of-sight flight we just want to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.730 
a line-of-sight flight we just want to
frame<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.910> still<00:04:28.300> or<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.630> bit<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.870> video<00:04:28.960> this

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
frame a still or a bit of video this

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.529 
frame a still or a bit of video this
will<00:04:29.889> be<00:04:29.949> perfect<00:04:30.190> because<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.759> can<00:04:30.819> see<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
will be perfect because you can see the

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.400 
will be perfect because you can see the
quad<00:04:32.610> easily<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.849> then<00:04:34.360> use<00:04:34.660> this<00:04:34.900> just<00:04:35.199> for

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
quad easily and then use this just for

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.890 
quad easily and then use this just for
framing<00:04:35.680> your<00:04:35.949> video<00:04:36.160> picture<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.569> I<00:04:37.599> think

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
framing your video picture so I think

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.290 
framing your video picture so I think
it's<00:04:38.199> to<00:04:39.009> be<00:04:39.130> honest<00:04:39.370> for<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.669> money<00:04:39.940> it's

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
it's to be honest for the money it's

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.610 
it's to be honest for the money it's
just<00:04:40.419> worth<00:04:40.720> getting<00:04:40.960> one<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.169> have<00:04:41.259> a<00:04:41.289> look<00:04:41.440> at

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
just worth getting one to have a look at

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.129 
just worth getting one to have a look at
I<00:04:41.770> would<00:04:41.889> say<00:04:42.539> yeah<00:04:43.539> this<00:04:43.720> this<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
I would say yeah this this the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.570 
I would say yeah this this the
instruction<00:04:44.560> sheet<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.860> comes<00:04:45.069> with<00:04:45.250> which<00:04:45.400> is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
instruction sheet it comes with which is

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.309 
instruction sheet it comes with which is
fine

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
fine

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.890 
fine
nothing's<00:04:47.319> confusing<00:04:47.979> at<00:04:48.069> all<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.789> do<00:04:49.090> have

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
nothing's confusing at all you do have

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.469 
nothing's confusing at all you do have
to<00:04:50.199> glue<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.949> foam<00:04:51.160> together<00:04:51.430> really<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.360> that

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
to glue the foam together really so that

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.939 
to glue the foam together really so that
you<00:04:52.599> can<00:04:52.780> pop<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.110> strap<00:04:53.349> through<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.680> slot

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
you can pop the strap through the slot

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.189 
you can pop the strap through the slot
because<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.759> join<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.330> along<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.900> line

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
because the the join is along this line

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.499 
because the the join is along this line
so<00:04:56.470> if<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.220> didn't<00:04:57.430> glue<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.849> foam<00:04:58.090> parts

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
so if you didn't glue the foam parts

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.330 
so if you didn't glue the foam parts
together<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:59.380> then<00:04:59.560> can't<00:04:59.860> believe<00:05:00.220> the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
together you then can't believe the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.060 
together you then can't believe the
strap<00:05:00.610> in<00:05:00.789> neatly<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:02.199> use<00:05:02.349> pio<00:05:02.560> after<00:05:02.919> that

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
strap in neatly I can use pio after that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.680 
strap in neatly I can use pio after that
I<00:05:03.250> just<00:05:03.430> glued<00:05:03.729> it<00:05:03.940> through<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.419> I've<00:05:04.539> just

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
I just glued it through and I've just

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.480 
I just glued it through and I've just
folded<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.320> over<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:05.770> taped<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.280> I've

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
folded it over and just taped it I've

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.339 
folded it over and just taped it I've
trimmed<00:05:06.789> it<00:05:06.940> off<00:05:07.030> neatly<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.930> doesn't<00:05:08.169> file

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
trimmed it off neatly so it doesn't file
