00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.600
So this is Xmas
And what have you done

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:35.680
Another year over
And a new one just begun

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.720
And so this is Xmas
I hope you have fun

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720
The near and the dear one
The old and the young

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.960
A very Merry Xmas
And a happy New Year

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:05.540
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:16.650
And so this 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.170
is Xmas
For weak and for strong

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:33.800
For rich and the poor ones
The world is so wrong

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:48.170
And so happy Xmas
For black and for white

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:18.090
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.670
A very Merry Xmas
And a happy New Year

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.800
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:55.480
And so this is Xmas
And what have we done

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:17.290
Another year over
A 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.740
new one just begun
And so happy Xmas

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.681
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear one

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:37.740
The old and 
the young

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.450
A very Merry Xmas
And a happy New Year

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.660
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.630
War is over, if you want it
War is over now

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.349
Happy Xmas
