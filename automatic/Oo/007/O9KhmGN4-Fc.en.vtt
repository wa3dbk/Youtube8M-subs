00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850

 is called ambrosia the meaning of this 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.950
 name is tarnished from the gods of Olympus 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.650
 they believed that sweet gave 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 immortality and it really does 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.439
 it's very delicious 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.080
 so from now on you will 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.680
 check with me how this candy of 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 ambrosia an easy sweet and very quick 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.009
 delicious 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.640
 then the recipe for ambrosia jam is 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:36.659
 composed of 12 eggs 2 kilos of sugar 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.320
 2 liters of clove and cinnamon milk August 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.899
 the juice of 2 million and the juice of two 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.780
 oranges and from now on I will show 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.030
 step by step how to make the candy of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.759
 ambrosia so first step 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.070
 I chose a large iron pot 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.799
 because it is a very traditional pan as well 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 champion that is the style of our recipe 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.450
 in an iron pot 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.729
 I always a bigger big pot 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.200
 than revenue both the period of and 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.780
 suddenly boil and it comes out of the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.319
 panela good first step first pick up 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.689
 sugar and we are going to keep this sugar 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.579
 that's the part of the housing 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.719
 recipe because we're going to have to wait 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:24.430
 of starting to melt this raw steel 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:27.519
 placed the sugar in the pan 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.439
 I'll put the clove and cinnamon this is the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.409
 I like each other and I do not like it very much. 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.590
 then I put a medium measure and 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.230
 now I'm going to start messing with the recipe 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.849
 begins to stir or sugar until this 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.620
 sugar begins to melt 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.069
 then I show a point of putting 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.069
 other ingredients 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.130
 is 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.130
 is 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.390
 at this moment where the sugar began to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.550
 crystallizing is already in the right moment of 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.080
 put the milk but it will also depend 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.000
 of the taste of each one 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.340
 if one wanted 12 ambrosia one 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.740
 little more burnt more golden 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.540
 you can stop having more sugar 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.910
 in my case I like him brighter 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.950
 so I'll add at that moment 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.950
 milk 300 2 liters of milk now 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.710
 ah 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.610
 now how milk is boiling so I 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.550
 I can do 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.800
 the last step of candy is eggs 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.709
 shaken 12 eggs beaten 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.180
 the juice of two oranges and I will mix 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:07.959
 so here are 12 beaten eggs and 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.590
 two oranges and a juice of 2 million 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.080
 I mixed everything, it leaves a little stir and over there 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.769
 I can add then of my milk 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.769
 it is boiling 

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.959
 ah 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.260
 now my sweet just wait 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.980
 I do not do anything else in the pot, I do not move 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.410
 I'll wait from 40 minutes to an hour. 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.590
 for it to be ready now I downloaded the 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.370
 lining fire people down to that 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.220
 cook well and also do not drain from the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.170
 panela conforms to the cooking book 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.180
 we can go lifting liner 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.640
 but the tone is around 40 minutes at a time. 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.780
 I'll show you a little time 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.780
 this great dose 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.420
 the candy is not ready yet make 20 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.670
 minutes it is still boiling 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.540
 We have 20 minutes to finally get it. 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.540
 finished 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.740
 Hmm 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.570
 so our revenue is ending 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.290
 now also depends on the taste of the 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.750
 person 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.540
 I particularly like to leave me one. 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.740
 sweet little pudding on account of what 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.560
 that freezes 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.080
 he stays in the refrigerator he dries 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.240
 so I'd rather leave it that way but if 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.160
 person prefer to leave leaner lean 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.230
 just leave another few minutes 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.080
 but for my taste is finalized 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.200
 I realize it 's a candy that forms the 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.630
 little groups and here all the big secret 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.320
 These are small groups that have been 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.760
 formed during these almost one hour of 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.480
 cooking 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.480
 now we just serve and taste 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.480
 now the sweet finalized sweet of ambrosia 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.640
 a lot of people like to eat in hot 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.450
 but the ideal is really to leave 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:51.420
 refrigerator and eat ice cream as a sweet 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.910
 with a lot of sugar he is a sweet that is not 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.300
 that does not spoil so quickly then 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.330
 also one of the reasons why this sweet 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.450
 appreciated in rural communities as 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.320
 I spoke earlier and the gauchos for 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.420
 to be an easy sweet cheap cheap and that 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.920
 good durability 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:17.160
 now I will serve because I deserve 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.850
 I try to taste this candy too. 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.060
 you mouth-watering to do so 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.010
 in your house 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.240
 Good appetite, I hope you have 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.240
 liked our revenue 

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:53.189
 the band
