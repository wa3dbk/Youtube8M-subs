00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 so first of all for this guide we are going 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.899
 tackle how to unlock 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.310
 crossbow 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.440
 so you have to go to battlelog 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.510
 then in the show 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.130
 here you click aftermath here 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.820
 it goes down to the bottom of the page 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.430
 and here are the different things we 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.400
 can unlock then there is the crossbow 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.700
 it takes to unlock the crossbow have 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.560
 the dlc aftermath and won three 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.110
 sleeves in loot mode so the mode 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.900
 stone which is the new mode of the dlc 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.130
 aftermath the crossbow with glasses 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.700
 now 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.710
 it is necessary to count 150 m of shots in 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.860
 full head with rifle rifles 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.250
 assault and rifle 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.070
 so basically if we align all the 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.200
 things must be done 150 m rifle 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.980
 assault is for example a n 16 to 3 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.710
 1 with 971 and rifle for example 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.540
 hans carrache sailing 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.110
 so the different tiles there is the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.989
 tile scan 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.010
 you have to make 20 spots so spots 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.230
 and 20 enemies 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.660
 ie on pc you press a 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.580
 and the little orange triangle that's 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.100
 that are displayed above the enemy and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.600
 on consoles on select marked ten 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.520
 vehicles same thing but for 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.120
 vehicles and get assistance 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.230
 mark you have to mark 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.290
 someone and one of your allies kills him 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.240
 then the tile balance the tile 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.940
 balanced you have to do 50 elimination 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 to the sniper rifle and make 10 shots 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.020
 in the head with a handgun 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.860
 which is quite easy the tiles 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 explosives 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.310
 it is necessary to make five victims with the pomegranate 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.160
 by hand to the auxiliary grenade and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.980
 at the c4 then the grenade in hand is 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.440
 simply a grenade a grenade 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.070
 normal the auxiliary grenade it's by 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 example a grenade launcher so a 320 m 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.880
 and the c4 is the 6 4 simply 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.100
 so here's for the different tiles 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.619
 and the two crossbows move on as a result 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.989
 that's where the crossbow is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.700
 will take in your class this is the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.510
 third instead of the liquid mail of the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.910
 m3 120 years the engineer the third 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.540
 instead of the rocket launcher in 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.019
 support instead of c 4 or keys 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.209
 dead and scared in the place of the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.209
 Laser marker of the das or micro drones 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:39.230
 Here the scan tile now 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.760
 scan tile that can be very useful 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.580
 in the street and to scan for example near 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.970
 from a base he scans at 10 meters to the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.330
 round 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.090
 what is 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.970
 big enough and when he scans you 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.090
 hear something I leave you 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.090
 listen 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.620
 so here is your character 10 shots from 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.390
 snipers in your area and you 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.140
 know that a year and a half ago then the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.850
 explosive tiles 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.610
 it can be useful against vehicles 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.790
 but it really is not effective 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.020
 against the infantry and he has a really 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.180
 a sharp decrease ie 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.580
 that they really fall so must 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.700
 really anticipate the shots and higher 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.020
 that the enemy or the vehicle 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.850
 look at these pictures I just have him 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.810
 makes wright marker while the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.400
 tile was really close to him 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.770
 but against vehicles for example 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.120
 against the haven ac for the same freak 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.590
 was still well underway but 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.080
 it's still quite effective and there 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.880
 in this case it destroyed it so 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.110
 the explosive tile I just add 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.070
 something is something 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.280
 a tile to use especially in class 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.390
 sniper and class doctors in class 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.640
 was scared because you did not 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.860
 absolutely nothing to compete with 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.430
 vehicles and even doctor class 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.900
 thing and it makes you anyway a 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.019
 weapon in addition it's always good to 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.800
 even take to destroy some keys 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.019
 death or c4 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.180
 here we go in the wake of 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.549
 tiles balanced then the tile 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.859
 balanced for me you are you have it 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.450
 unlocked you must not use the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.400
 basic tile because the tile 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.630
 balanced goes further it is more 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.330
 accurate and it does more damage to more 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.280
 long distance so look here we go 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.830
 compare on this wall the balanced tile 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.740
 who does that really go where I shot 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.000
 and the basic tile look 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.460
 now the basic tile 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.229
 you can change tiles to 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.790
 changing as if you change your shot 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.430
 so that's the basic tile is when 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.820
 even and still below you see 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.100
 that I am about 15 to 20 m from 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.050
 wall so now the tiles 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.990
 explosives at that distance there we go 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.700
 also see his decay so watch 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.340
 I shoot in the same place and they fall 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.370
 still well below you've seen a hit 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.200
 is it fallen around where I pull 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.180
 it's really not very efficient then 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.670
 there the precision tile for shooting 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.930
 by far it's quite useful but you 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.910
 will see that it takes really had 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.710
 a lot of time that the tile 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.710
 happens he's really not going to look fast 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.670
 and I touch them and 2 3 seconds after 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.110
 that I shot you are respawn 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.440
 and you will do this animation of 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.870
 reloading you can avoid it avoid 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.930
 this this animation as soon as you 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.110
 respawn and 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.660
 you take as soon as you respawn and 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.780
 when you take the crossbow look 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.880
 you take the crossbow you change 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.530
 the army will give you back immediately and 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.000
 you do not need to do this anymore 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.919
 animation so that you can win a 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.949
 shortly the balanced tile is 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.410
 also very effective at short range you 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.860
 have seen on this picture it is enough 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.580
 effective so between the crossbow and 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.650
 the crossbow with glasses 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.120
 it really depends on your style of play 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:12.169
 but the crossbow without glasses and and for 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:16.830
 me - specify even in the maps 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.300
 pretty close enough so me 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.220
 I use a lot more often to 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.289
 the crossbow with glasses that's all 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.289
 for this tutorial that 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.569
 I hope you enjoyed it if it did you 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.370
 no longer left a gem and subscribe to my 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.030
 chain it would make me really happy 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.030
 See you
