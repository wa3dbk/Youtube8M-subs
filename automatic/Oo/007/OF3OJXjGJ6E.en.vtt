00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone I'm call me directors 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.900
 of colmen technologies on this occasion 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.749
 is going to present this project that is 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.259
 different parts different modules in 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:15.719
 first time comes the module of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.640
 I work the work station that is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.500
 relatively smaller of the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 next this work station 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.580
 has a dresser which would come 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.880
 being the first module of all the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880
 piece of furniture 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.829
 the second module has been the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.829
 drawers 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.190
 the third module has been the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.010
 library 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 which has storage until the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 lower part 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.070
 and the fourth module is the inn where 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.400
 can hold most of the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.400
 dispositives 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.860
 I will explain what are the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.189
 electronic devices that it has 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.440
 this project the first one is a must in 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.659
 where are all the cameras where 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.909
 souls where the information arrives all 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.509
 the security cameras of the building 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.100
 they come with your laptop and a monitor 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.820
 auxiliary for the same laptop 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 it also has another small module 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.369
 that basically what he gives us are 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.840
 voltage supply to go 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.990
 different connectors 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.560
 and also the screen of the cameras 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.560
 security 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.070
 we also find another model where 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.500
 we can see that from here 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.290
 handle the entire desk 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.940
 for example when activating this this 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.530
 switch as we already saw it 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.900
 turn on the security cameras 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 and allow us can see being 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 presenting on the interior exteriors 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 However 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.550
 regarding the second module by 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.470
 example this can not be opened 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.030
 drawers so a switch was obtained 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 with them you can open the drawers 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.560
 without any problem 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 this control panel controls all the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.319
 draft 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.170
 now now we also have the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.540
 desktop computer that would come 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.569
 also being the main theme of all the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.600
 draft 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:59.010
 basically this computer 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.950
 has two 20 centimeters fans 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.470
 good that we can find it to simple 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.530
 view and another one that is in the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.890
 lower part of the computer where 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.300
 the two make air intake for the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.560
 computer interior 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.950
 hidden has another fan that does the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.580
 extraction of the air that has already been 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.360
 'the hot one is already 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.840
 all this pc 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.430
 is embedded inside the inn 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.430
 and within this model 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.060
 we can also find a usb hub 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.100
 also suitable for there are besides the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.680
 which are unique exclusively for 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.730
 find the furniture can be recorded 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.530
 different names nicknames has in 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.890
 this case has a receiver 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.330
 three xbox 360 controls and all their 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.330
 complete audio system 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.239
 this team has this project 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.239
 has different solutions of 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.239
 illumination 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.950
 which are that they can be battery or 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.750
 as you already saw it in the case of 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.040
 the computer that is being with 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.310
 coming switches that take 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.800
 voltage current 110 for for the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.800
 case of my country colombia 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.480
 what is being done with this project 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.509
 is to make a station a station 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.150
 work 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.409
 completely totally different 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.929
 technological 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.439
 intervene from them different 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:59.629
 devices that make life easier 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.830
 the people who work in this module 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.830
 or work stations 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.310
 the computer has sensors 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.699
 temperature and fan regulators the 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.340
 which by voltage assignments 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.139
 they increase or decrease the 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.030
 speed 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.889
 also has the sensors of 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.460
 temperature which are installed by 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.189
 different parts of the computer and they go 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.699
 automatically connected to the 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.699
 the fans 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.770
 well, that's practically the 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.340
 draft 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.690
 colby thank you very much for having 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.690
 seen this well
