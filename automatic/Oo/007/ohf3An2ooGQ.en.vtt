00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the camera so all those three cable

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.999 
the camera so all those three cable
before<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.750> lift<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.290> make<00:01:52.560> sure<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.829> lose

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
before you lift it up make sure you lose

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.940 
before you lift it up make sure you lose
in<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.850> model<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> different<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in some model is different but all this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.480 
in some model is different but all this
model<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:57.299> type<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> connection<00:01:57.930> so

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
model have some type of connection so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
model have some type of connection so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.810 
supply for this model a 13 11 so
and<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.500> you'll<00:02:13.740> run<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.310> same<00:02:14.520> thing

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and then you'll run into the same thing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.000 
and then you'll run into the same thing
you<00:02:15.480> take<00:02:15.690> your<00:02:15.870> Phillips<00:02:16.080> screwdriver<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
you take your Phillips screwdriver you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.430 
you take your Phillips screwdriver you
have<00:02:17.250> four<00:02:17.490> screws<00:02:17.850> right<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:19.020> lift<00:02:19.230> up

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
have four screws right here you lift up

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.920 
have four screws right here you lift up
the<00:02:19.500> screws<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.910> three<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.330> them<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.750> bigger

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the screws it's three of them and bigger

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.880 
the screws it's three of them and bigger
size<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.710> one<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.220> them<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.670> small<00:02:24.420> size<00:02:24.750> so

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
size and one of them is small size so

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.030 
size and one of them is small size so
pretty<00:02:25.890> much<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.400> did<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> prep<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
pretty much I did the prep for you and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.130 
pretty much I did the prep for you and
after<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.490> lift<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.900> where

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
after that you lift it up this is where

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.860 
after that you lift it up this is where
you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> power<00:02:32.640> supply<00:02:33.060> once<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you can get the power supply once you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.900 
you can get the power supply once you
get<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> power<00:02:34.290> supply<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.010> these<00:02:35.580> remember

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
get the power supply and these remember

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
get the power supply and these remember
you<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> couple<00:02:36.480> connectors<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.410> take

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
you have a couple connectors you take

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500 
you have a couple connectors you take
out<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.950> smaller<00:02:38.190> connector<00:02:38.580> from<00:02:38.910> power<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
out the smaller connector from power and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.199 
out the smaller connector from power and
that's<00:02:40.350> how<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.800> power<00:02:41.010> supply<00:02:41.459> now

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
that's how you the power supply now

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.960 
that's how you the power supply now
similarly<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.620> same<00:02:43.830> thing<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.760> a

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
similarly you can do the same thing on a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
similarly you can do the same thing on a
hard<00:02:45.240> drive<00:02:45.390> replacement<00:02:46.200> if<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.470> were<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.890> do

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
hard drive replacement if you were to do

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.460 
hard drive replacement if you were to do
hard<00:02:47.280> drive<00:02:47.550> instead<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.510> power<00:02:48.750> supply<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
hard drive instead of power supply you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.110 
hard drive instead of power supply you
take<00:02:49.709> out<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.010> SATA<00:02:50.280> hard<00:02:50.520> drive

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
take out your SATA hard drive

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.530 
take out your SATA hard drive
removing<00:02:51.930> your<00:02:52.050> data<00:02:52.980> cable<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.730> power<00:02:53.970> cable

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
removing your data cable and power cable

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.130 
removing your data cable and power cable
and<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:56.520> other<00:02:56.790> cable<00:02:57.239> connected<00:02:57.720> once<00:02:57.959> you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and this other cable connected once you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.560 
and this other cable connected once you
do<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.470> same<00:02:59.400> thing<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.940> take<00:03:00.180> out<00:03:00.360> these

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
do this same thing you take out these

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.040 
do this same thing you take out these
