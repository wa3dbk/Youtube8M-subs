00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.360
 [Music] 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.420
 how are all these bands and come 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.670
 here has me the new one is another video 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.990
 for all of you working for 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.320
 your 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.900
 especially this time he will try 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.789
 on a page so that you can 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.629
 download then know them sergio 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.020
 little ones 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.840
 how can you meet him 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.030
 it's a pretty good machine and I'm going to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.560
 treat four good points this page 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.170
 in one it is who asks for it so many 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.580
 requirements that your computer has 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.790
 it does not demand that they have a computer 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.140
 quite powerful that's one pointed the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.820
 second is that it has a great variety 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.829
 of games as you can see them 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.410
 and the third point is that it's compatible 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.590
 with the three operating systems that 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.590
 know that they are the 13 microsoft 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.399
 in the English team 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:23.140
 to the software license license 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:27.250
 that about free software is this one that is 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.860
 for free you can tell him and he does not have 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.740
 nothing to be buying the serial 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.140
 so they have the full game and so 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.830
 I do not have a final version of anything 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.060
 this 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.340
 [Music] 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.909
 but let's go to the electric is this 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.590
 fire in the title 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.049
 information about this and what we have to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.409
 see is the distance he wanted he did not want 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:54.220
 it's free you can download it and that's how it says 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.579
 commercial license from a module 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.590
 serial that does not just download the second 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.390
 advice we are told platforms is 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.729
 contention needed but I have with the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.530
 which is compatible as before linux 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:11.500
 windows live and psd this new have of 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.300
 that is and to be able to be downloaded 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.310
 one says official website is a link 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.160
 direct to the official page of this 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.390
 game and saying they can download since 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.010
 we are on the official page of the game 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.580
 let's find the tab that says 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.319
 downloads or download and here we are here 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.069
 who is there when he sends another 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.920
 little window or the next page and let's go 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.989
 to look for the 10 that are this for the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.540
 version of windows that are compatible 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.360
 with windows like this time that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.940
 I made the sand what he talks about 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.790
 windows and here I have it for linux 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.450
 linux and mac 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.590
 and it's good has enough servers 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.290
 download 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.910
 in the first 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:03.000
 in all environments 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.010
 and when it was uploaded updated with the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.880
 next systems are compatible and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.500
 things like that 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.500
 We are going to give you the button you mentioned 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.879
 we hope that the window of 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.870
 download and so we not only demand 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.500
 a click here and we will be able to 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.500
 download it 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.340
 and we are going to unload another fire of 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.010
 here so they have more this 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.019
 more understandable how to download new is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.019
 so easy to choose this 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.970
 we see that from a gpl license that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.580
 it is fine windows linux platforms is 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.300
 all right 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.400
 the official Moor we are going to look for it 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.200
 the download tab or the section 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.050
 downloads 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.530
 in this case it comes in English christ 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.180
 we look for you to shoot for windows that is 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.640
 This tells me that it is also compatible 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.130
 with mac and os 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:13.470
 resting by direct link tower 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:16.830
 which is 60 years old 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.830
 [Music] 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.500
 and that's what he has to do every time 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.510
 choose a game from this page so that 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.510
 can download it 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.919
 good people or more than a thousand bands and this 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.830
