00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.470
 9 let's say that it all started when 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.520
 I was little asked my mom about 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.990
 give me a camera and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.930
 when he gave it to me concert a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.910
 photograph any program I have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.110
 and it was beautiful because I felt kind 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.790
 best seed in the world 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.280
 instead then taking pictures where you see 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:42.770
 but also typed I became interested in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:48.020
 tree flowers in high school so e 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.020
 photograph it only flowers or not because 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.600
 after I said to myself oh well this is not it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.460
 what I want to do because he felt 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 just the need to tell me things 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 that I was photographing what to do then 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 unfortunately the only thing I can say 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.090
 what people do and then I have 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 started by myself why not 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.569
 because you do the tripod tests 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 self-timer 10 seconds with team rhythms 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:26.609
 pose and ai the photo or otherwise created in the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.189
 style and said to myself we also photograph 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.619
 other people because it is beautiful to the sector 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.119
 which ones tip a lot of reach 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 also a certain intimacy with this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 now with for me that I was always a lot 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.539
 insecure as a child 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 let's say he was a great help 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.609
 photograph them because you get some 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.149
 safety with your body so you see e 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:56.219
 of this there is nothing in mind 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.939
 seventh place the type ii non mission 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.939
 can help 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.200
 I decided to do the nude because 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.350
 looking at photos of different artists is me 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 especially eye- catching terry 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.990
 richardson and so i said ok 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.770
 I can do too 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.440
 it was the push to overcome the blockade 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.370
 initial I had and that made me 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.180
 think what people will say what marelli 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.680
 guiding my family 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.110
 so since I always had this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.570
 interest in the human body and wanted 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.770
 just take pictures that show him 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.820
 to be or without censorship I started 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.650
 and the first time I remember that 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.310
 before publishing my pressed 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.100
 portrait in the world was a bit doubtful 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.050
 like maybe those doubts you now have of 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.860
 think about it I say doubtful but I said I had 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 a bit of security just because I have 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.920
 said okay I'm okay with me 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.830
 same but then but of my mothers it is not 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.520
 so happy then I said okay this 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.950
 life is mine 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.840
 that is, what I do I have to decide 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.100
 I'm of age and maybe now or one 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.510
 my ability to reason with my head e 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.810
 I also considered that you are not doing it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:39.690
 nothing wrong but simply show 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:49.980
 a little art fall and no one and I clicked 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:55.830
 post is always so the idea that who does 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.900
 way is a person without maybe a real one 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.480
 artistic sense a real purpose in life 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.690
 so the first thing you do undress and e 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.790
 passing his photos on the internet is not 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.209
 this is really my goal 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.140
 kind of a meditating revolution though 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.140
 maybe it may seem 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.109
 I don't know about a house with an ego 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.190
 disproportionate because maybe for the bags 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.990
 both the TF secret vaguely photo is not there 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.639
 to say, you are the one to do one 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.660
 such revolution that maybe the 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.000
 people don't care about one 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.880
 revolution of the genus though in the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.280
 life we all have a purpose 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.100
 I think this is mine if we 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.560
 we live this life there must not be 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.550
 no one who has to say what you owe 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 do and you have to listen to anyone e 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.540
 change for someone else then 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.490
 simply be yourself and do 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.979
 what you want to do then there will be 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.520
 always people to tell you that it's not good 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:59.460
 or the more he likes it or that second 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.100
 them what you are doing does not have one 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:12.510
 purpose or does not make sense but it is hot air 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:15.600
 Latin do not have are one who thinks that 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.010
 photography must necessarily launch 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.960
 this is the artistic message 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.419
 deep intense only for the 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.610
 enthusiasts or just for those who can read 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.740
 I think if something you can 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:34.440
 give everyone so people can 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.740
 to do what I want are many of 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.229
 their 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.539
 from this point of view I think that 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.790
 really if yesterday disconnect anyway 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.320
 move to excite 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.490
 those are my photos I've already done 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.710
 something I remember this interview 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.740
 that had been requested by this 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.020
 Italian blog and his blog is called 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.800
 judges for me this question must be asked 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.320
 who asked me how I felt 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.740
 I agree with it so I replied that 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.070
 He had so familiar tone with time 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.860
 and that I think every person must 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:14.090
 feel comfortable with your own 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:18.590
 body and being proud so it is and this 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.490
 nice convinced he used to say what 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.950
 you are saying 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.090
 it makes no sense because to photography alone 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.240
 perfect people and then I have them 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.090
 said then people do not read 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.280
 what I what today has 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.950
 said people simply draw 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.860
 conclusions and I think not what goes to 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.080
 affect them I never said 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.390
 photographer people who are not perfect 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.240
 he didn't even say go and take pictures 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.700
 on perfect people I didn't say that 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.920
 a person must not simply be 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.170
 bad because it does not follow certain canons 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.420
 if I then decided to do some 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.430
 type of photography and select 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.190
 certain people but nothing to do 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.670
 with feeling good with 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.200
 body everyone should be comfortable 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.410
 in one's body also because I don't 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.290
 I am a super two meters tall gym 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.870
 so I shouldn't even be on mine 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:18.790
 blog if you only photograph yourself 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:21.040
 perfect and so I really made myself 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.140
 I count people even when maybe 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.380
 they have the chance to understand that 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:33.610
 he wants to do and that he does even before 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:40.710
 person does not go beyond and unfortunately though 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.710
 what can you do nothing about are tense
