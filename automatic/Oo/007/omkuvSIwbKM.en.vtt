00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.470
 I do not know what to really say 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.220
 three minutes 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 for the greatest battle of our lives 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.170
 professionals 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.590
 everything comes down to today 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.920
 or 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.640
 we play 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.300
 as a team or we fall apart 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.550
 move to move inch by inch until 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:40.000
 the end now we are in hell 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:43.680
 gentlemen believe and we stay here 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 letting us crush 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.239
 we struggle to return to light 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.239
 we can get out of hell 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.559
 inch to inch 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.230
 look when you get older in life 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.080
 there are things that are going 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.360
 that's part of life but only 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.430
 you learn that when you start to lose 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.290
 those things 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.230
 you discover that life is a matter of 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 inches like that is football 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.830
 because in every game 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.800
 there is football the margin of error is very 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.980
 small half second slower more 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.440
 fast if you do not get to pass it half 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.780
 second slower or faster and not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.130
 you get to take it the inches that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.610
 we need to be around us 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.689
 they are in every moment of the game in each 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.689
 minute and every second 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.550
 in this team we fight for that terrain 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.760
 in this team we leave them the skin 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.570
 us and each other for that 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.220
 inch that you win because when 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.800
 we add one after another 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.620
 because we know that if we add those 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.180
 inches that's what will mark the 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.180
 difference of winning 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.540
 / m 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.829
 or die 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.770
 I will tell you one thing in each fight that 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:27.460
 stronger is the winner this field 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.980
 says yes that life is mine is because 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.380
 I still want to fight and die for that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.050
 inch 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.950
 porter live consists of that 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.300
 I can not convince you not to do 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.160
 you have to look at the one you have at your 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.820
 side look him in the eye 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.470
 I think you're going to see an uncle willing to 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.440
 win it with you 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.050
 you are going to see an uncle who will sacrifice 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.210
 for this team because he knows that when 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.680
 come the chance you 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.680
 you will do the same for him 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:09.060
 that's a gentlemen's team 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:14.180
 or we cure ourselves now as the team 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.180
 or we will die as individuals 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.600
 kisses in soccer guys 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.260
 that's all it is 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.260
 now 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.650
 what are you going to do 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.340
 ah
