workouts first of all everyone is
different<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.209> my<00:04:14.450> opinion<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.109> think<00:04:15.379> people

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
different in my opinion I think people

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.279 
different in my opinion I think people
usually<00:04:15.859> overeat<00:04:16.729> or<00:04:16.880> severely<00:04:17.720> under<00:04:18.109> eat

you<00:04:18.799> have<00:04:19.009> to<00:04:19.190> figure<00:04:19.430> out<00:04:19.549> what's<00:04:19.759> right<00:04:19.940> for

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
you have to figure out what's right for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
figuring out what's right for you is to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.779 
figuring out what's right for you is to
calculate<00:04:24.229> your<00:04:24.350> BMR<00:04:24.860> that's<00:04:25.220> your<00:04:25.370> basal

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
that number is once you've figured it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.400 
that number is once you've figured it
out<00:04:35.389> from<00:04:35.900> there

out from there

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.010 
out from there

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.180 
you're doing that day so a leg training
day<00:04:41.570> would<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> lot<00:04:42.470> more<00:04:42.500> added<00:04:42.949> calories

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
timing around your workouts is how you

pretty much start making changes to your
physique<00:04:51.169> just<00:04:52.009> like<00:04:52.160> supplements<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:53.090> need

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
physique just like supplements you need

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
right to start building muscle tissue

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.980 
right to start building muscle tissue
back<00:04:57.680> after<00:04:58.099> hard<00:04:58.370> workouts<00:04:58.759> you'll<00:04:59.630> have<00:04:59.810> to

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
back after hard workouts you'll have to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.730 
back after hard workouts you'll have to
find<00:05:00.229> the<00:05:00.710> right<00:05:00.979> ratio<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.740> macronutrients

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
find the right ratio of macronutrients

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.580 
find the right ratio of macronutrients
and<00:05:03.889> those<00:05:04.070> are<00:05:04.250> proteins<00:05:04.789> carbs<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:05.570> fats<00:05:05.870> to

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
and those are proteins carbs and fats to

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.839 
and those are proteins carbs and fats to
get<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.889> results<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.340> you<00:05:07.490> want

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
get the results that you want

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.060 
get the results that you want
if<00:05:08.389> you're<00:05:08.599> kind<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.930> lost<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.590> where<00:05:09.889> to

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
if you're kind of lost and where to

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.070 
if you're kind of lost and where to
start<00:05:10.460> with<00:05:10.669> figuring<00:05:11.060> out<00:05:11.240> what<00:05:11.419> ratios<00:05:11.900> work

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
start with figuring out what ratios work

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.500 
start with figuring out what ratios work
for<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.409> I<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:12.889> to<00:05:13.070> start<00:05:13.430> with<00:05:13.970> an<00:05:14.120> equal

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
for you I like to start with an equal

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.279 
for you I like to start with an equal
ratio<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.490> if<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.849> have<00:05:17.090> an<00:05:17.210> equal<00:05:17.539> ratio<00:05:17.900> of

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
ratio so if you have an equal ratio of

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.680 
ratio so if you have an equal ratio of
proteins<00:05:18.740> carbs<00:05:19.159> and<00:05:19.340> fats<00:05:19.520> let's<00:05:20.389> say<00:05:20.539> it's

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
proteins carbs and fats let's say it's

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.870 
proteins carbs and fats let's say it's
about<00:05:20.840> it's<00:05:21.169> going<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.349> be<00:05:21.409> end<00:05:21.620> up<00:05:21.740> about<00:05:21.919> 33%

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
about it's going to be end up about 33%

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.120 
about it's going to be end up about 33%
of<00:05:23.030> each<00:05:23.270> one<00:05:23.599> as<00:05:23.870> part<00:05:24.199> of<00:05:24.289> your<00:05:24.409> entire<00:05:24.800> daily

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
of each one as part of your entire daily

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.879 
of each one as part of your entire daily
calories<00:05:25.699> so<00:05:25.909> for<00:05:26.270> example<00:05:26.750> if<00:05:26.960> I'm<00:05:27.530> going<00:05:27.800> to
