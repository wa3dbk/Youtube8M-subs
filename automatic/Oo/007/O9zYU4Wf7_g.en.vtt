00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
built and tricked out to the best of its

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.350

ability<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.050> green<00:03:28.620> plate<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:30.150> can't

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
ability with the green plate you can't

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.570 
ability with the green plate you can't
do<00:03:30.510> much<00:03:30.690> with<00:03:30.900> these<00:03:31.080> for<00:03:31.800> customization<00:03:32.130> I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
do much with these for customization I

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
think all you can do is change the play

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.960 
think all you can do is change the play
color<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.650> them

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970
