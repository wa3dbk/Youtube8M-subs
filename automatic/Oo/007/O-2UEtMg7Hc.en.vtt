00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.470
 city ​​in the ring against the militia 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.139
 have applied 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.900
 tactical missile systems which 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 Exactly we learn from my colleague Alexander 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.380
 Lance Cove works in Lugansk 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.210
 a direct relationship with the history of Alexander 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 hello what can you tell about 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 situations in Lugansk and its surroundings 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.849
 what happens these minutes to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.130
 welcome 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.670
 Well now you how to Evening 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.100
 see in lugansk here but actually 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.219
 it's quite normal now 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.739
 this time of day is very loud here 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.200
 because the bombing continues they don't 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 stopped for a day and intervals 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.420
 between them is either half an hour or several 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.300
 hours maximum I want to say about the fact that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.949
 here is just yesterday in area 3 hospital 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 urban which continues to work 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.309
 take the wounded and injured was 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 discovered here flew tip from 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.680
 missiles that we explained 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.740
 the specialists 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.490
 is ammunition which 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.970
 shoots . have this missile complex already 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.759
 mass destruction and rocket it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 short range ballistic 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:27.150
 literally 150 meters from this object 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.159
 from these hospitals was found was found 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.530
 It had been found and other parts of this 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.840
 rockets and quite by chance not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.119
 detonated and according to experts and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.420
 the militia nobody suffered if 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.009
 this rocket exploded then actually 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.729
 defeat area would be very extensive 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.299
 perhaps a whole quarter of Lugansk more 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.680
 would not exist I suggest to listen 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:55.409
 sync specialists about this 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.979
 between the Shcherbakov quarter of her for superfluous 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.450
 quarters here is a training ground 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:06.409
 firefighters here we found it today is 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.729
 ballistic missile short range. 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.140
 but it looks like and and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.959
 only the starting part of the rocket itself 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.569
 I exploded in detail until I start 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.170
 if the five-story building got 5 floor keep not 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:35.489
 it was generally I think even the foundation from 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:39.959
 they are not left with 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:44.510
 should come here and supreme council 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.640
 Republic of that it guarantees 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.160
 clear distribution of these humanitarian 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.049
 cargo already identified points are people who 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.019
 will be responsible for this and this 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.620
 deal well with the operational environment 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.390
 such that the north of the city ​​is still 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.840
 captured in a ring and this is the road 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.269
 living on the city of Krasnodon which is 40 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.730
 kilometers from Lugansk she is still 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.620
 still remains inaccessible and there is a ride 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.750
 there is dangerous because they are fierce 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.849
 fighting in the village of Novy Svetlovka i am 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.010
 not by chance standing by the way with these newspapers 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.959
 with these editions i just wanted them 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.079
 demonstrate that this is local 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.650
 Lugansk newspaper called it the 21st century 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.359
 it used to go out in this format 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.019
 now she has become such martial 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.519
 leaflets where in principle it is 4 formats 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.560
 and here on the front page last 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.300
 operational situation in the city well 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.190
 as far as possible 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.750
 find out and she's on the back here on the very 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.070
 Deal important social information 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.440

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.680
 water and humanitarian aid while it is still 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.030
 there is and 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.200
 Well, also all sorts of documents that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.990
 can provide 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.490
 on the loss of property administration lnr and 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.380
 thanks to the loss of housing Alexander 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.420
 in direct connection with the studio was ours 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.770
