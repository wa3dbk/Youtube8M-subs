thousands of tiny little air bubbles

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.570 
thousands of tiny little air bubbles
that<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.779> beat<00:00:22.050> into<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> egg<00:00:22.619> whites<00:00:22.920> this

that you beat into the egg whites this
is<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.510> gets<00:00:24.600> lift<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.140> cake<00:00:25.439> also

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
is one way it gets lift in the cake also

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.550 
is one way it gets lift in the cake also
those<00:00:26.970> air<00:00:27.269> bubbles<00:00:27.300> when<00:00:28.109> they're<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
those air bubbles when they're in the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.339 
those air bubbles when they're in the
oven<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.460> heat<00:00:29.699> hits<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.779> steam<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
oven the heat hits them the steam and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.319 
oven the heat hits them the steam and
the<00:00:31.380> bubbles<00:00:31.769> expand<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:33.000> gives<00:00:33.180> you

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the bubbles expand and this gives you

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020 
the bubbles expand and this gives you
even<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.690> lift<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.469> we're<00:00:35.430> using<00:00:35.579> flour

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
even more lift and we're using flour

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.170 
even more lift and we're using flour
today<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.630> we're<00:00:36.750> using<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.260> cake<00:00:37.559> flour

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
today but we're using this cake flour

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
today but we're using this cake flour
that's<00:00:39.180> very<00:00:39.300> light<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.260> keeps<00:00:41.070> everything

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that's very light and keeps everything

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.940 
that's very light and keeps everything
light<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.379> rise<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
light so we can have some rise in the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950 
light so we can have some rise in the
cake<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> high<00:00:45.239> proportion<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
cake and there is a high proportion of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.889 
cake and there is a high proportion of
egg<00:00:46.200> whites<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> flour<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.480> other<00:00:48.600> thing

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
egg whites to the flour the other thing

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
egg whites to the flour the other thing
is<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.350> use<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.920> leaveners<00:00:50.789> like

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
heating process and then you'll know

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.700 
heating process and then you'll know
exactly<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.659> oven<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> right

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
exactly when your oven is the right

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.010 
exactly when your oven is the right
temperature<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.729> based<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.479> says<00:01:48.750> on

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
temperature not based on what it says on

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
temperature not based on what it says on
your<00:01:49.049> dial<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> oven<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.490> based<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.090> what

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
your dial on the oven but based on what

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
your dial on the oven but based on what
this<00:01:51.540> oven<00:01:51.899> thermometer<00:01:52.200> says<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.369> can

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this oven thermometer says and you can

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.880 
this oven thermometer says and you can
always<00:01:53.820> leave<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.450> oven<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.649> have

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
always leave this in your oven and have

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.350 
always leave this in your oven and have
it<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.310> all<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> time<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.240> you're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it in there all the time so when you're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
it in there all the time so when you're
baking<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.960> cooking<00:01:58.049> other<00:01:58.409> things<00:01:58.740> you'll

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
baking and cooking other things you'll

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.289 
baking and cooking other things you'll
always<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.490> accurate<00:02:00.090> temperature

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
always know the accurate temperature

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.480 
always know the accurate temperature
some<00:02:01.259> people<00:02:01.530> find<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> their<00:02:02.070> oven<00:02:02.340> is

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
some people find that their oven is

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.039 
some people find that their oven is
actually<00:02:02.820> hotter<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.360> cooler<00:02:03.570> than<00:02:03.899> they

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
actually hotter or cooler than they

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.649 
actually hotter or cooler than they
thought<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> good<00:02:05.430> idea<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.030> not<00:02:06.509> very

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
thought so it's a good idea and not very

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.389 
thought so it's a good idea and not very
expensive<00:02:07.049> investment<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
expensive investment to get the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.690 
expensive investment to get the
temperature<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.400> 10

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
temperature right so here we have a 10

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.130 
temperature right so here we have a 10
inch<00:02:11.879> tube<00:02:12.150> pan<00:02:12.360> you're<00:02:12.599> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> need<00:02:13.110> one

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
inch tube pan you're going to need one

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.880 
inch tube pan you're going to need one
of<00:02:13.319> these<00:02:13.560> two

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
of these two

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
of these two
make<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.190> cake<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.150> has<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> removable

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
make this cake and it has a removable

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.550 
make this cake and it has a removable
bottom<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.069> two<00:02:17.250> pieces<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:19.319> too

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
bottom so it's in two pieces it's too

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.710 
bottom so it's in two pieces it's too
traditional<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.490> angel<00:02:21.000> food<00:02:21.090> cakes<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.569> use

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
traditional for angel food cakes to use

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.050 
traditional for angel food cakes to use
this<00:02:21.870> type<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.140> pan<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.490> not<00:02:23.670> grease

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
this type of pan and we do not grease

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.420 
this type of pan and we do not grease
the<00:02:24.330> pan<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.319> put<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> batter<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the pan we just put the batter in the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.400 
the pan we just put the batter in the
reason<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> cake<00:02:28.200> can

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
reason for this is so that the cake can

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.110 
reason for this is so that the cake can
actually<00:02:28.740> grab<00:02:29.040> onto<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> sides<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> pan

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
actually grab onto the sides of the pan

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.020 
actually grab onto the sides of the pan
and<00:02:30.630> rise<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:31.980> very<00:02:32.340> high<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.850> that's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and rise and it's very high so that's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.460 
and rise and it's very high so that's
where<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.330> get<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> lift<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
where you get more of the lift in the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.980 
where you get more of the lift in the
cake<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.940> other<00:02:36.090> thing<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.420> saves<00:02:36.780> us

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
cake the other thing is that saves us

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.570 
cake the other thing is that saves us
time<00:02:37.050> because<00:02:37.620> we<00:02:37.770> don't<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.220> grease<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
time because we don't have to grease the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
time because we don't have to grease the
pan<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.090> if<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.300> did<00:02:39.480> grease<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.930> pan<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
pan and if we did grease the pan the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.620 
pan and if we did grease the pan the
batter<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.770> slip<00:02:41.610> down<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.239> we<00:02:42.390> want<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
batter would slip down so we want to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570 
batter would slip down so we want to
avoid<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.770> other<00:02:43.980> thing<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.310> i<00:02:44.430> have

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
avoid that the other thing is i have

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.550 
avoid that the other thing is i have
another<00:02:44.880> smaller<00:02:45.330> pan<00:02:45.750> today<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.260> need<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
another smaller pan today we need the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.979 
another smaller pan today we need the
10-inch<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.520> you'll<00:02:47.880> see<00:02:48.090> some<00:02:48.330> smaller<00:02:48.600> pans

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
10-inch but you'll see some smaller pans

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.770 
10-inch but you'll see some smaller pans
like<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.130> pan<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.209> same<00:02:51.390> basic

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
like this and this pan is the same basic

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.650 
like this and this pan is the same basic
design<00:02:51.830> but<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.950> has<00:02:53.130> these<00:02:53.340> feet<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:53.910> so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
design but it has these feet on it so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.300 
design but it has these feet on it so
i'll<00:02:54.810> tell<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.170> about<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.410> later<00:02:55.739> because

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
i'll tell you about that later because

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.060 
i'll tell you about that later because
it<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.910> handy<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.390> there's<00:02:57.870> feet<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.590> cake

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
it is handy if there's feet on the cake

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.699 
it is handy if there's feet on the cake
pan<00:02:59.459> for<00:03:00.090> when<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.450> cool<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.720> if<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.470> don't
