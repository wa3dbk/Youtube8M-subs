there's quite a few players but then

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
there's quite a few players but then
again<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:39.930> really<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> same<00:00:40.649> time

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

again it's not really at the same time
like<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.700> should<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:41.910> able<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> finish<00:00:42.390> this

FIFA there's not many headed goals in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
FIFA there's not many headed goals in
the<00:01:09.510> game<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> only<00:01:10.860> goal<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the game and that was the only goal of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
the game and that was the only goal of
the<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.760> obviously<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.540> win<00:01:12.689> is

the game so obviously a one there win is
nice<00:01:13.290> fridge<00:01:13.619> because<00:01:13.799> obviously<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.880> get

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
nice fridge because obviously we do get

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.100 
nice fridge because obviously we do get
the<00:01:15.090> three<00:01:15.270> points<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:15.930> did

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the three points I think he did

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
the three points I think he did
disconnect<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> something<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:18.060> really

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
disconnect to something so not really

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
disconnect to something so not really
less<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.720> we're<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.229> players<00:01:19.530> away

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
less but we're only two players away

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
less but we're only two players away
from<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.369> finishing<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> full<00:01:21.240> Chelsea

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
from actually finishing a full Chelsea

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
from actually finishing a full Chelsea
side<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.110> how<00:01:22.259> absolutely<00:01:23.159> incredible

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
side that's how absolutely incredible

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
side that's how absolutely incredible
for<00:01:23.700> saying<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.030> much<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.750> for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
for saying how much they are going for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.499 
for saying how much they are going for
at<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> moment<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.530> BPL<00:01:26.369> plays<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.119> general

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
at the moment like BPL plays in general

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
at the moment like BPL plays in general
going<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.290> Chelsea<00:01:28.680> players<00:01:28.920> are

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
going for a lot in Chelsea players are

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
going for a lot in Chelsea players are
probably<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.990> head

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
probably going for a lot more so we head

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
probably going for a lot more so we head
into<00:01:31.259> another<00:01:31.619> game<00:01:31.829> against<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> 4<00:01:32.490> 1<00:01:32.610> 2<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.030> 2

what to do with this free kick but in

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.390 
what to do with this free kick but in
the<00:01:37.110> end<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.500> hit<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> wall<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the end I just hit it at the wall and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
the end I just hit it at the wall and
then<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.850> somewhere<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.299> got<00:01:39.509> through<00:01:39.750> to

mikela Mikkel just puts it into the back

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
mikela Mikkel just puts it into the back

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079

scored<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> second<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.829> maybe<00:01:46.829> he's<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
scored in the second and maybe he's a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
scored in the second and maybe he's a
lucky<00:01:47.159> charm<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.000> did<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> one

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
lucky charm because the game did and one

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
lucky charm because the game did and one
nil<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> end<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.649> obviously<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.520> nice

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
nil in the end so obviously that's nice

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.580 
nil in the end so obviously that's nice
for<00:01:50.850> us<00:01:51.060> another<00:01:51.329> guy<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> did<00:01:51.899> disconnect

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
for us another guy that did disconnect

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.889 
for us another guy that did disconnect
and<00:01:52.890> obviously<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.939> servers<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> side

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and obviously the servers on the a side

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
and obviously the servers on the a side
haven't<00:01:55.290> been<00:01:55.439> doomed<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.040> well<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.610> that's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
haven't been doomed to well so that's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.950 
haven't been doomed to well so that's
probably<00:01:57.060> why<00:01:57.329> I've<00:01:57.420> been<00:01:57.630> getting<00:01:57.899> these

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
probably why I've been getting these

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.230 
probably why I've been getting these
wins<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> end<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.520> head<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.850> another

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

disconnecting<00:02:37.689> so<00:02:37.870> maybe<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.739> bit<00:02:38.829> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
disconnecting so maybe it's a bit of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.670 
disconnecting so maybe it's a bit of
karma<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.430> our<00:02:39.700> side<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.359> we<00:02:40.989> obviously<00:02:41.109> I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
karma on our side so we obviously I

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.679 
karma on our side so we obviously I
think<00:02:42.189> we're<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.639> about<00:02:42.760> six<00:02:43.209> points<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
think we're on about six points in the

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.179 
think we're on about six points in the
table<00:02:43.870> three<00:02:44.230> points<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:44.590> some<00:02:44.709> reason<00:02:44.829> so

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
table three points or some reason so

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.860 
table three points or some reason so
that<00:02:45.370> all<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.549> wind<00:02:45.819> didn't<00:02:46.209> count<00:02:46.419> so<00:02:46.689> that's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that all the wind didn't count so that's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.809 
that all the wind didn't count so that's
a<00:02:46.989> little<00:02:47.169> bit<00:02:47.349> annoying<00:02:47.709> but<00:02:47.859> we're<00:02:48.579> going<00:02:48.760> to

heading to another game I don't know if

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.650 
heading to another game I don't know if
I<00:04:32.610> would<00:04:32.730> be<00:04:32.880> tempted<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.270> do<00:04:33.450> some

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
I would be tempted to do some

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.720 
I would be tempted to do some
tournaments<00:04:34.140> or<00:04:34.260> something<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.890> prizes

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
tournaments or something that prizes

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.060 
tournaments or something that prizes
aren't<00:04:36.540> really<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:37.020> good<00:04:37.260> compared<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.890> what

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
aren't really that good compared to what

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.950 
aren't really that good compared to what
the<00:04:38.280> divisions<00:04:39.030> gives<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.510> it's<00:04:39.660> probably

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
the divisions gives you it's probably

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.990 
the divisions gives you it's probably
the<00:04:40.080> better<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.440> do<00:04:40.620> division<00:04:40.890> so<00:04:41.280> we<00:04:41.850> head

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
the better to do division so we head

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.970 
the better to do division so we head
into<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.210> game<00:04:42.420> against<00:04:42.720> a<00:04:42.810> 352<00:04:43.440> serie<00:04:43.800> a

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
game but we haven't really got the

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.140 
game but we haven't really got the
strongest<00:05:58.890> side<00:05:59.220> at<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.430> moment<00:05:59.760> we<00:05:59.850> have<00:05:59.970> got

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
strongest side at the moment we have got

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.450 
strongest side at the moment we have got
some<00:06:00.390> good<00:06:00.900> players<00:06:01.020> like<00:06:01.350> matage<00:06:01.800> terry<00:06:02.190> and

some good players like matage terry and
of<00:06:02.520> course<00:06:02.790> drug<00:06:03.000> berber<00:06:03.480> generally<00:06:04.410> it's<00:06:04.560> not

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
of course drug berber generally it's not

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.890

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
the strongest team in the world so we're

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.090 
the strongest team in the world so we're
going<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.110> head<00:06:07.230> into<00:06:07.380> another<00:06:07.860> game

unfortunately<00:06:08.460> like<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.540> chelsea<00:06:09.870> players

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
unfortunately like the chelsea players

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.900 
unfortunately like the chelsea players
at<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.230> moment<00:06:10.530> are<00:06:10.620> just<00:06:10.860> really<00:06:11.580> expensive

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
at the moment are just really expensive

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.820 
at the moment are just really expensive
and<00:06:12.420> there's<00:06:12.660> no<00:06:12.780> real<00:06:12.990> light<00:06:13.200> middle<00:06:13.590> ground

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
and there's no real light middle ground

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.260 
and there's no real light middle ground
where<00:06:13.950> we<00:06:14.070> can<00:06:14.250> just<00:06:14.400> pick<00:06:14.580> one<00:06:14.760> up<00:06:14.880> every<00:06:15.150> of

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
where we can just pick one up every of

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.880 
where we can just pick one up every of
the<00:06:15.360> game<00:06:15.540> but<00:06:15.750> i'm<00:06:16.230> pretty<00:06:16.410> sure<00:06:16.530> we'll<00:06:16.860> be

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
the game but i'm pretty sure we'll be

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.070 
the game but i'm pretty sure we'll be
able<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.190> do<00:06:17.400> at<00:06:17.520> least<00:06:17.550> one<00:06:17.940> per<00:06:18.180> episode<00:06:18.390> so

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080
