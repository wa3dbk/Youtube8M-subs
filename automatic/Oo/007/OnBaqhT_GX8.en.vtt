00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.200
 that a paramotor is an association 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.690
 wing of a paragliding sail and a 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.059
 engine so the combination of the two in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 a paramotor the take off to can 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 to stop what is basically 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 especially the paramotor since at the start 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.590
 the cart why because the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 paramotor stems naturally from 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.519
 paragliding and paragliding it's always 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 from take off on foot since we 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 calls the takeoff spots but so 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.019
 it stays really stops the base of the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.920
 paramotor where we will find 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.530
 most interesting sensations we're going 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 say since imagine you take off by 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.780
 your own 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.329
 your feet that is hidden little by little 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 ground level like a bird like 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.020
 when it comes to me is so it's 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.020
 the sensations are fabulous 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.220
 be aware that stealing is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.160
 mostly is managed at the base on 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.700
 dream of every man so what is 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.940
 fabulous 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.810
 me what I liked is to tell me 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.310
 for me aeronautics 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.510
 always passionate smaller it was 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.040
 always a difficult medium 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.300
 accessible for various reasons 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.260
 financial or time and then we 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.100
 thinks it's difficult 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.170
 to learn how to fly 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.580
 the benefit of an engine is that it is 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.900
 accessible to the greatest number 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.750
 and then what's great is the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.220
 shares the friendliness since it is 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 always more pleasant to fly at least 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.610
 two or more 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.610
 go go go 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.740
 once there up you'll see what 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.909
 is nice enough to fly over the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.390
 small fog sheet tati sunrise 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.030
 morning 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.310
 we have the impression of rubbing shoulders with the clouds 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.740
 it's a pretty extraordinary feeling 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.799
 the rise and empty the head 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.789
 it was above all the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.920
 world it's very difficult to describe it 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.189
 really needs to be leveraged but when you have it 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.979
 tasted 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.479
 generally we seem to spend more and we 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.640
 can not wait until the weather is 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.979
 the best possible to leave 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.069
 take off the clip possible everything 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.069
 simply
