in<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.840> video<00:00:01.020> I'm<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.380> give<00:00:01.530> this

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
in this video I'm going to give this

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.640 
in this video I'm going to give this
photograph<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.639> border<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.959> drop<00:00:04.350> shadow

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
photograph a border with a drop shadow

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.230 
photograph a border with a drop shadow
and<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.279> will<00:00:05.400> make<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.580> look<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:06.120> little

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
and that will make it look a little

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.690 
and that will make it look a little
classier<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:07.109> maybe<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.189> want<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.490> print<00:00:08.639> it

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
classier and maybe you want to print it

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.990 
classier and maybe you want to print it
with<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> border<00:00:09.320> so<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.530> frame<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.550> so

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
with a border so you can frame it but so

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.700 
with a border so you can frame it but so
this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.150> how<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.139> we've<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.679> our

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this is how you do it so we've got our

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.770 
this is how you do it so we've got our
you<00:00:14.400> know<00:00:14.429> down<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.730> our<00:00:14.880> layers<00:00:15.089> panel<00:00:15.389> we've

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
you know down in our layers panel we've

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
you know down in our layers panel we've
got<00:00:15.990> our<00:00:16.070> background<00:00:17.070> image<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.520> just

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
got our background image which is just

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.040 
got our background image which is just
my<00:00:18.810> little<00:00:19.109> girl<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.590> take<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.580> lock<00:00:21.390> drag

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
my little girl here take the lock drag

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.070 
my little girl here take the lock drag
it<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> trash<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.810> right

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it to the trash and then I'm going right

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080 
it to the trash and then I'm going right
next<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> trash<00:00:25.769> icon<00:00:26.189> there<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:26.910> an

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
next to the trash icon there there's an

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.960 
next to the trash icon there there's an
add<00:00:27.300> layer<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:28.349> click<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.130> it'll<00:00:29.730> be

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
add layer just click on it and it'll be

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.810 
add layer just click on it and it'll be
an<00:00:30.269> empty<00:00:30.599> layer<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.980> want

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
an empty layer you can see here I want

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.780 
an empty layer you can see here I want
to<00:00:33.000> make<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.480> layer<00:00:33.750> white<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.550> by

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to make that layer white so do that by

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.139 
to make that layer white so do that by
pushing<00:00:36.180> command<00:00:36.930> backspace<00:00:38.120> that'll<00:00:39.120> make

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
pushing command backspace that'll make

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.700 
pushing command backspace that'll make
it<00:00:39.300> white<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> reason<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it white and the reason for that is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459 
it white and the reason for that is
command<00:00:41.040> backspace<00:00:41.809> prompts<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> background

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
command backspace prompts the background

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.990 
command backspace prompts the background
color<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.100> case<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> background<00:00:44.879> color

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
color in this case the background color

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.479 
color in this case the background color
is<00:00:45.180> white<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.110> wanted<00:00:46.469> option<00:00:46.950> backspace

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
is white if I wanted option backspace

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.520 
is white if I wanted option backspace
that'll<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> foreground<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.410> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that'll be the foreground which in this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.880 
that'll be the foreground which in this
case<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> black<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.420> white<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> then

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
case is black but I want white so then

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.380 
case is black but I want white so then
what<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> turn<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.090> one

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
what we do I'm going to turn that one

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
what we do I'm going to turn that one
off<00:00:55.280> go<00:00:56.280> down<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:58.170> portrait<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
off go down here to this portrait and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.209 
off go down here to this portrait and
put<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> into<00:00:59.789> free<00:01:00.090> transform<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.350> image<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
put it into free transform so image and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
put it into free transform so image and
it's<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.449> edit<00:01:03.899> free<00:01:04.470> transform<00:01:04.769> or

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it's all right edit free transform or

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.020 
it's all right edit free transform or
command<00:01:05.880> T<00:01:06.860> shift<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.159> option<00:01:08.659> or<00:01:09.659> shift<00:01:10.140> alt

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
command T shift and option or shift alt

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
command T shift and option or shift alt
at<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> same<00:01:12.360> time<00:01:12.659> drag<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
at the same time drag in one of the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
at the same time drag in one of the
corners<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.760> scale<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
corners and that will scale the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
corners and that will scale the
photograph<00:01:16.970> appropriately<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.210> let<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
photograph appropriately if I let one of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.570 
photograph appropriately if I let one of
them<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.340> i<00:01:20.400> push

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
them go I can do this but if i push

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
them go I can do this but if i push
shift<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.420> option<00:01:22.700> it'll<00:01:23.700> it'll<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
shift and option it'll it'll do it so it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
shift and option it'll it'll do it so it
has<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> same<00:01:26.400> dimensions<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> same

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
has the same dimensions are the same

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.819 
has the same dimensions are the same
ratio<00:01:28.350> anyways<00:01:29.240> ok<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.840> let<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.350> I'm

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
ratio anyways ok and then let go I'm

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
ratio anyways ok and then let go I'm
pretty<00:01:32.280> happy<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.970> push<00:01:33.240> the

check mark or enter and then I'm going

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.179 
check mark or enter and then I'm going
to<00:01:38.490> select<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.450> whole<00:01:40.200> photograph<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.130> i

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
to select this whole photograph now if i

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
to select this whole photograph now if i
push<00:01:41.430> select<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.259> selects<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
push select all now it selects the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
push select all now it selects the
entire<00:01:43.890> canvas<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
entire canvas I don't want that what I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
entire canvas I don't want that what I
want<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:48.079> what<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> want<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.460> photograph

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
want is what I want is just a photograph

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.080 
want is what I want is just a photograph
so<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> ways<00:01:53.090> probably

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so to do that one of the ways probably

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359 
so to do that one of the ways probably
the<00:01:54.149> longest<00:01:54.299> way<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.130> possibly<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> most

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the longest way but possibly the most

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.719 
the longest way but possibly the most
accurate<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.420> go<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> view<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
accurate would be to go to view and

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.590 
accurate would be to go to view and
rulers<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.340> ruler<00:02:02.729> here<00:02:03.000> go

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
rulers so now we have a ruler here go

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
rulers so now we have a ruler here go
over<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> ruler<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.829> drag<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
over to the ruler and just drag in and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.260 
over to the ruler and just drag in and
you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.550> create<00:02:09.090> these

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
you can see that will create these

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.820 
you can see that will create these
guidelines<00:02:09.690> they're<00:02:10.500> called<00:02:10.739> guidelines

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
guidelines they're called guidelines

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.530 
guidelines they're called guidelines
and<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.430> reason<00:02:12.580> I'm<00:02:12.790> doing<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.300> because

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and the reason I'm doing this is because

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.690 
and the reason I'm doing this is because
when<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.110> selection<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.860> will<00:02:14.980> lock<00:02:15.250> into

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
when I do a selection it will lock into

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.390 
when I do a selection it will lock into
the<00:02:16.000> guideline<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.750> exactly<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:18.190> size

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the guideline so it's exactly the size

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.020 
the guideline so it's exactly the size
of<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> frame<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.510> sides<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.960> photograph

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
of the frame the sides of the photograph

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.380 
of the frame the sides of the photograph
click<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.210> rectangular<00:02:22.840> marquee<00:02:23.170> tool<00:02:23.440> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
click the rectangular marquee tool and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.660 
click the rectangular marquee tool and
go<00:02:25.390> up<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.570> one<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.020> corners<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:27.490> will

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
go up to one of the corners and it will

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.780 
go up to one of the corners and it will
lock<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:29.020> all<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.950> sides<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
lock into all the sides of the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.280 
lock into all the sides of the
photograph<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:31.570> now<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.870> perfect

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
photograph so now it's a perfect

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.760 
photograph so now it's a perfect
selection<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.980> exact<00:02:33.430> dimensions<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
selection the exact dimensions of the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.450 
selection the exact dimensions of the
photograph<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:37.240> can<00:02:37.530> turn<00:02:38.530> off<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
photograph you can turn off the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.520 
photograph you can turn off the
guidelines<00:02:39.910> by<00:02:40.150> going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.600> view<00:02:40.690> clear

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
guidelines by going to view clear

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.940 
guidelines by going to view clear
guidelines<00:02:42.300> now<00:02:43.300> go<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.230> layer<00:02:44.470> above<00:02:44.800> it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
guidelines now go to the layer above it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.850 
guidelines now go to the layer above it
it's<00:02:45.490> just<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.940> white<00:02:46.150> layer<00:02:46.770> select<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
it's just the white layer select the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.250 
it's just the white layer select the
white<00:02:48.040> layer<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.600> now<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
white layer on and now we have the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.730 
white layer on and now we have the
selection<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.340> white<00:02:51.520> layer<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:53.590> what

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
selection on the white layer so now what

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.930 
selection on the white layer so now what
we<00:02:53.890> want<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.520> just<00:02:54.760> push<00:02:55.090> delete<00:02:56.050> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
we want to do is just push delete and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.020 
we want to do is just push delete and
delete<00:02:57.940> tool<00:02:58.660> basically<00:02:59.410> make<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> hole<00:03:00.250> into

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
delete tool basically make a hole into

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.140 
delete tool basically make a hole into
this<00:03:04.320> top<00:03:05.320> layer<00:03:05.560> which<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:06.280> acts<00:03:06.730> as<00:03:07.030> our

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
this top layer which now acts as our

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.050 
this top layer which now acts as our
border<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.170> now<00:03:08.290> push<00:03:08.500> command<00:03:09.130> D<00:03:09.550> for

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
border so now push command D for

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.870 
border so now push command D for
deselect<00:03:10.860> make<00:03:11.860> sure<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.370> still<00:03:12.670> have

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
deselect make sure that you still have

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.690 
deselect make sure that you still have
the<00:03:13.270> upper<00:03:14.110> layer<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.620> border<00:03:14.950> highlighted

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
the upper layer the border highlighted

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.810 
the upper layer the border highlighted
go<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.480> FX<00:03:16.900> button<00:03:17.170> down<00:03:17.470> here<00:03:17.820> and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
go to this FX button down here and

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.430 
go to this FX button down here and
you'll<00:03:18.970> see<00:03:19.120> drop<00:03:19.390> shadow<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.140> one<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
you'll see drop shadow is the one the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.699 
you'll see drop shadow is the one the
last<00:03:20.590> one<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.000> like<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.420> go<00:03:22.570> with<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.780> angle

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
last one so I like to go with a angle

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.270 
last one so I like to go with a angle
directly<00:03:24.610> above<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.690> 90<00:03:26.500> degrees<00:03:26.860> i'll<00:03:27.100> just

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
directly above so 90 degrees i'll just

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.420 
directly above so 90 degrees i'll just
type<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.550> 90<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.560> see<00:03:29.800> just<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.370> you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
type in 90 and just to see just so you

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.570 
type in 90 and just to see just so you
can<00:03:30.670> see<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.030> effect<00:03:31.920> right<00:03:32.920> now<00:03:33.130> I'm<00:03:33.459> just

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
can see the effect right now I'm just

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.030 
can see the effect right now I'm just
going<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.880> exaggerate<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.350> let's<00:03:35.650> take<00:03:35.980> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
going to exaggerate it so let's take the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.030 
going to exaggerate it so let's take the
spread<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.910> size<00:03:37.269> really<00:03:38.230> high<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.890> can

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
spread and the size really high you can

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.460 
spread and the size really high you can
see<00:03:39.220> now<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.430> it's<00:03:39.760> adding<00:03:40.180> some<00:03:40.810> dimension

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
see now that it's adding some dimension

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.080 
see now that it's adding some dimension
to<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.600> border<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.080> photograph<00:03:45.090> turn

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
to the border and the photograph turn

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.729 
to the border and the photograph turn
the<00:03:46.209> opacity<00:03:46.480> layup<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.320> can<00:03:47.440> see<00:03:47.620> it

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
the opacity layup and you can see it

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.560 
the opacity layup and you can see it
there<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:48.220> almost<00:03:48.340> like<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.580> vignette<00:03:48.970> it's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
there it's almost like a vignette it's

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.540 
there it's almost like a vignette it's
way<00:03:49.750> too<00:03:49.810> strong<00:03:50.230> though<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.709> turn<00:03:50.860> the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
way too strong though you can turn the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.250 
way too strong though you can turn the
opacity<00:03:51.820> down<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.660> maybe<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:53.080> 40<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:55.260> you

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
opacity down to maybe like 40 and you

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.660 
opacity down to maybe like 40 and you
can<00:03:56.410> make<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.769> distance<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.340> little<00:03:57.370> bit

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
can make the distance a little bit

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.240 
can make the distance a little bit
bigger<00:03:58.440> size<00:04:00.660> spread<00:04:01.860> so<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.010> looks<00:04:03.190> pretty

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
bigger size spread so that looks pretty

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.190 
bigger size spread so that looks pretty
nice<00:04:03.720> probably<00:04:04.720> too<00:04:04.870> much<00:04:05.019> though<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:07.200> just

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
nice probably too much though so just

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.140 
nice probably too much though so just
touch<00:04:08.590> these<00:04:08.860> back<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.130> little<00:04:09.400> bit<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:09.790> then

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
touch these back a little bit and then

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.449 
touch these back a little bit and then
push<00:04:10.870> okay<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:11.769> see<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.010> we've<00:04:12.280> got

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
push okay and you can see that we've got

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.349 
push okay and you can see that we've got
a<00:04:12.489> little<00:04:12.790> drop<00:04:13.000> shadow<00:04:13.269> here<00:04:13.600> nice<00:04:14.410> subtle

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
a little drop shadow here nice subtle

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.270 
a little drop shadow here nice subtle
border<00:04:16.359> around<00:04:16.709> separating<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.799> white<00:04:17.979> and

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
border around separating the white and

and the photograph all right so that's a
pretty<00:04:20.620> standard<00:04:21.160> traditional<00:04:21.310> border<00:04:21.970> let's

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
pretty standard traditional border let's

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.600 
pretty standard traditional border let's
go<00:04:23.050> back<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.500> make<00:04:23.830> something<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.250> little<00:04:24.370> bit

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
go back and make something a little bit

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.840 
go back and make something a little bit
more

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
more

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.290

interesting so you can see what's going
on<00:04:28.390> what<00:04:29.140> you<00:04:29.290> could<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.610> instead<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.030> this

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
on what you could do so instead of this

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.100 
on what you could do so instead of this
instead<00:04:34.420> of<00:04:34.570> just<00:04:34.780> just<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.170> rectangular

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
instead of just just a rectangular

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.660 
instead of just just a rectangular
border<00:04:38.110> let's<00:04:38.590> deselect<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.340> make<00:04:39.430> something

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
border let's deselect and make something

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.840 
border let's deselect and make something
else<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:41.140> let's<00:04:41.350> make<00:04:44.280> let's<00:04:45.280> make<00:04:45.580> something

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
else so let's make let's make something

else so let's make let's make something
like<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.460> make<00:04:51.670> sure<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.940> second<00:04:52.390> one<00:04:52.540> is

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
like this so make sure the second one is

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.240 
like this so make sure the second one is
selected<00:04:53.200> so<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.470> will<00:04:53.560> add<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.040> layers

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
selected so it will add to the layers

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.520 
selected so it will add to the layers
and<00:04:54.580> we'll<00:04:55.210> just<00:04:55.390> do<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.900> bunch<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.290> really

select this layer here first we can push

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.239 
select this layer here first we can push
command<00:05:46.969> J<00:05:47.539> i<00:05:47.779> will<00:05:48.139> copy<00:05:48.319> just<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:49.039> piece

wait for it okay there it is so it can

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.499 
wait for it okay there it is so it can
turn<00:06:05.229> that<00:06:05.379> one<00:06:05.560> off<00:06:05.710> you<00:06:06.400> can<00:06:06.580> see<00:06:06.789> here<00:06:07.060> now<00:06:07.270> I

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
turn that one off you can see here now I

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.469 
turn that one off you can see here now I
almost<00:06:08.970> didn't<00:06:09.970> quite<00:06:10.150> keep<00:06:10.449> it<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:13.330> can<00:06:13.449> just

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
almost didn't quite keep it you can just

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.330 
almost didn't quite keep it you can just
start<00:06:13.750> again<00:06:14.020> but<00:06:14.289> you<00:06:14.409> can<00:06:14.560> see<00:06:14.710> here<00:06:14.949> that<00:06:14.979> I

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
start again but you can see here that I

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.200 
start again but you can see here that I
I<00:06:16.740> can<00:06:17.740> even<00:06:17.830> just<00:06:18.039> move<00:06:18.250> this<00:06:18.400> over<00:06:18.580> there<00:06:19.090> we

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
I can even just move this over there we

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.439 
I can even just move this over there we
go<00:06:23.009> okay<00:06:24.009> and<00:06:24.190> then<00:06:24.370> we<00:06:24.520> can<00:06:24.669> go<00:06:24.699> to<00:06:24.849> our<00:06:25.060> drop

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
go okay and then we can go to our drop

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.930 
go okay and then we can go to our drop
shadow<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:27.629> you<00:06:28.629> can<00:06:28.810> see<00:06:29.050> that<00:06:29.849> makes<00:06:30.849> a

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
shadow and you can see that makes a

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.850 
shadow and you can see that makes a
pretty<00:06:31.090> cool<00:06:31.330> effect<00:06:31.629> and<00:06:31.870> actually<00:06:32.500> what<00:06:32.830> I

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
pretty cool effect and actually what I

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.110 
pretty cool effect and actually what I
would<00:06:33.039> probably<00:06:33.159> do<00:06:33.580> is<00:06:34.590> crop<00:06:35.590> go<00:06:36.400> over<00:06:36.610> over

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
would probably do is crop go over over

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.230 
would probably do is crop go over over
here<00:06:37.270> to<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.389> crop<00:06:37.599> tool<00:06:37.810> and<00:06:38.139> crop<00:06:39.099> in<00:06:39.340> from

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
here to the crop tool and crop in from

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.510 
here to the crop tool and crop in from
all<00:06:40.419> the<00:06:40.509> sides<00:06:40.979> so<00:06:41.979> it's<00:06:42.130> not<00:06:42.280> so<00:06:42.759> thick<00:06:47.520> so

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
all the sides so it's not so thick so

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.499 
all the sides so it's not so thick so
you<00:06:48.550> can<00:06:48.819> make<00:06:48.880> some<00:06:49.090> pretty<00:06:49.240> interesting

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
you can make some pretty interesting

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.920 
you can make some pretty interesting
borders<00:06:50.080> just<00:06:50.919> with<00:06:51.130> the<00:06:51.280> selections<00:06:51.849> and<00:06:52.090> a

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
borders just with the selections and a

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.939 
borders just with the selections and a
white<00:06:53.280> layer<00:06:54.479> there<00:06:55.479> you<00:06:55.569> go<00:06:55.719> let's<00:06:56.710> wait<00:06:56.889> for

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
white layer there you go let's wait for

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:05.219 
white layer there you go let's wait for
this<00:06:57.190> come<00:06:57.520> up<00:06:57.550> here<00:07:01.680> yeah<00:07:02.680> so<00:07:02.979> there<00:07:03.099> you<00:07:03.159> go
