00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 hello everyone I think that those who have long been 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 watching my channel one by one only 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 the name of which master was understood today 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 there will be a speech actually anboxing 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.350
 I do this only to 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.480
 the owner of this knife 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.619
 made sure that everything is fine here well 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.599
 actually if there are any shoals 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.349
 to captivate in the way of removing yourself 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 a responsibility 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.730
 yes here so here i catch so let's 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:48.649
 open this parcel 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:48.649
 what do you like my new knife and see 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.379
 beautiful box let's try 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.420
 do nothing to hurt 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.000
 How did it happen ? And the trader herself 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.280
 I opened the package I also review this knife 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.950
 will of course 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.930
 I can tell you already at this stage that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.229
 This knife I without change our in quality 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.119
 well, for probably weeks 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.790
 3 just do not take off normally and those 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 the functions I need to 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.740
 he performed the knife he performed very fat 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 without any problems not looking at all 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 such intricacy of its design 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.520
 its geometry 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 in fact the knife is just letters that is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880
 this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.640
 tea test so here we have 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.640
 unplanned product placement and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 Of course a bunch of polyethylene oh you already 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.849
 see us at least probably not yet 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.709
 You see, but I see here already with a knife 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.369
 wielded mods that I wasted for fear 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.620
 disturb the beauty 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.000
 what we see now is according to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.760
 some one of the most one of 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.560
 most such say so beautiful and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.280
 This practical materials for 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.989
 use on the handle skin cooling 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.470
 stingray sits pretty tight clones come on 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.470
 buddy 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.030
 food 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.580
 these are moments like when 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.320
 how do i need to say something like 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.320
 want to say something yes but damn it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.170
 let's drink doc 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:09.900
 knife grease can not stick to it 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.930
 every nasty thing let's take a closer look 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 on the hilt about practicality and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.810
 beauty 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.810
 the beauty of commenting i'm probably not 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.700
 I'll be here all pretty obvious by 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.100
 about the practicality of stingray leather is 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 one of the most such 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.680
 resistant materials give to different 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.100
 sort of irritants 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.959
 it is very tenacious that is it provides 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.470
 very cool grip worked with 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.530
 palm 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.670
 work time yes and well now I have my hands 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.080
 a little wet taking this knife in your hand 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.890
 you feel discomfort at the same time 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.760
 Feelings like from some such know 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.980
 Well, let's say quite a positive such 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.110
 g10 will give a good notch and 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.600
 a letter notching that does not rub not 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.140
 starts namely created by clutch 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.440
 that is a lot of it is cool about 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.170
 blade knives urakova 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.329
 in principle, they could in my understanding 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.979
 to occupy a special position that is it 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.750
 something very beautiful and very bright and 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.350
 very cool looking 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.030
 but from my point of view well at least 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.550
 least for those tasks that are before 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.320
 me in front of my knives is very little 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.550
 Apply and that is, for example, I do not 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.300
 imagine where i could 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.370
 use 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.620
 here is this monster that is it well 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.440
 actually shoulders 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.610
 there is also a sword, but me 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.610
 really like the shape 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.120
 it is the socialists there are fried in all vengeance 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.600
 come on, yeah, I really like it 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 the form I really like traditional 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.550
 let's say so japanese up geometry at 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.690
 This did not really like the performance I 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.930
 I have nothing against it 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.640
 chisels we are just a knife of such dimensions with 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.350
 such a thick butt 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.010
 yes, for me, it's just a little bit 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.620
 bust 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.470
 well, just congratulate maxim 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.350
 great knife great choice i'm honest 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.680
 saying don't even know think poppy now 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.550
 yourself glad everything is fine you understand the sand is not 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.930
 I will comment 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.030
 things like boxing are obvious to him 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.890
 I hope you were interested in what it means 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.820
 I hope you were interested, thank you for 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.820
 Good luck viewing
