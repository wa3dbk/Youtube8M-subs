it's got a skull additional leather
spine<00:01:03.879> running<00:01:04.879> down<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:05.600> protect<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> sheath

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
spine running down to protect the sheath

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.870 
spine running down to protect the sheath
itself<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.490> know<00:01:07.729> okay<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.990> know<00:01:09.880> it'll

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880

pocket yeah I suppose you could use that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.240 
pocket yeah I suppose you could use that
for<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.900> fire<00:01:21.140> starter<00:01:21.650> or<00:01:21.920> sharpener<00:01:23.920> I'm<00:01:24.920> not

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
for a fire starter or sharpener I'm not

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.950 
for a fire starter or sharpener I'm not
certain<00:01:25.610> what<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:25.909> designed<00:01:26.300> for

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
certain what it's designed for

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.440 
certain what it's designed for
but<00:01:27.710> however<00:01:28.159> I'm<00:01:28.430> sure<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:28.729> becoming<00:01:29.090> handy

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
but however I'm sure it becoming handy

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.630 
but however I'm sure it becoming handy
for<00:01:29.570> something<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:30.860> all<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.159> sheath<00:01:31.370> is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
for something so in all the sheath is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.440 
for something so in all the sheath is
pretty<00:01:31.940> standard<00:01:33.670> now<00:01:34.670> let's<00:01:34.909> have<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.120> look<00:01:35.299> at

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
pretty standard now let's have a look at

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.750 
pretty standard now let's have a look at
the<00:01:35.510> actual<00:01:35.750> knife<00:01:36.020> itself<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:37.130> bear<00:01:37.580> in<00:01:37.610> mind

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
the actual knife itself now bear in mind

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.730 
the actual knife itself now bear in mind
this<00:01:38.120> is<00:01:38.780> straight<00:01:39.229> out<00:01:39.260> of<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> box

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
this is straight out of the box

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.800 
this is straight out of the box
brand-new<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:42.400> your<00:01:43.400> immediate<00:01:43.729> feel<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.540> is

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
brand-new and your immediate feel is is

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.100 
brand-new and your immediate feel is is
that<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.619> solid<00:01:45.950> wear<00:01:46.580> engineered<00:01:47.150> knife<00:01:47.479> it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
that of a solid wear engineered knife it

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.219 
that of a solid wear engineered knife it
doesn't<00:01:48.470> feel<00:01:48.590> flimsy<00:01:48.920> at<00:01:49.490> all<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.990> mean

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
doesn't feel flimsy at all and I mean

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.469 
doesn't feel flimsy at all and I mean
one<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> main<00:01:51.590> reasons<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.479> physical

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
one of the main reasons is the physical

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.330 
one of the main reasons is the physical
size<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.440> steel<00:01:54.680> running<00:01:54.979> through<00:01:55.220> it

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
size of the steel running through it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.870 
size of the steel running through it
this<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.640> three<00:01:56.479> point<00:01:56.750> seven<00:01:56.900> mil<00:01:57.320> think

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
this is three point seven mil think

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.929 
this is three point seven mil think
that's<00:01:58.880> way<00:01:59.720> thicker<00:01:59.750> than<00:02:00.260> saying

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
that's way thicker than saying

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.000 
that's way thicker than saying
comparable<00:02:01.939> size<00:02:02.240> or<00:02:02.450> more<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.630> for<00:02:02.900> example

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
comparable size or more a for example

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.530 
comparable size or more a for example
much<00:02:04.010> much<00:02:04.220> thicker<00:02:04.490> braid<00:02:04.820> all<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.210> way<00:02:05.299> down

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
much much thicker braid all the way down

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.789 
much much thicker braid all the way down
the<00:02:05.689> spine<00:02:05.750> here<00:02:07.090> now<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.840> blade<00:02:09.110> length<00:02:09.379> is

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
the spine here now the blade length is

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.210 
the spine here now the blade length is
just<00:02:10.399> under<00:02:10.610> four<00:02:10.819> inches<00:02:11.150> at<00:02:11.330> 97<00:02:11.989> mil<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.439> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
just under four inches at 97 mil and the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.479 
just under four inches at 97 mil and the
overall<00:02:13.730> length<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.599> knife<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.189> 214<00:02:16.189> mil

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
overall length of the knife is 214 mil

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.420 
overall length of the knife is 214 mil
but<00:02:17.420> without<00:02:17.659> doubt<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.830> first<00:02:19.159> thing<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
but without doubt the first thing that

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
looking at a few more details of this

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.690 
looking at a few more details of this
knife<00:02:39.659> it's<00:02:40.659> a<00:02:40.900> 420<00:02:41.890> stainless<00:02:42.629> with<00:02:43.629> a<00:02:43.659> clip

pretty<00:02:48.790> standard<00:02:49.239> stuff<00:02:49.329> there<00:02:49.659> really<00:02:49.900> but

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
pretty standard stuff there really but

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.940 
pretty standard stuff there really but
one<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.209> features<00:02:52.359> I<00:02:52.689> I<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.319> lot<00:02:53.680> are

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
one of the features I I like a lot are

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.800 
one of the features I I like a lot are
the<00:02:54.329> handle<00:02:55.329> scales<00:02:55.769> there<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.010> g10<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.810> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
the handle scales there the g10 and I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.959 
the handle scales there the g10 and I
particularly<00:02:59.590> like<00:02:59.859> this<00:03:00.010> material<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.609> it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
particularly like this material and it

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.119 
particularly like this material and it
does<00:03:01.239> feel<00:03:01.510> nice<00:03:01.750> on<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.200> knife<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
does feel nice on this knife the

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.770 
does feel nice on this knife the
advantage<00:03:03.669> and<00:03:03.879> one<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> good<00:03:04.480> design

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
advantage and one of the good design

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.449 
advantage and one of the good design
features<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.709> knife<00:03:05.889> is<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.189> fact<00:03:06.400> that

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
features of this knife is the fact that

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.809 
features of this knife is the fact that
they've<00:03:06.669> they've<00:03:07.510> included<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:09.040> talk<00:03:09.340> star

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
they've they've included the talk star

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.099 
they've they've included the talk star
screws<00:03:10.180> here<00:03:11.040> which<00:03:12.040> enable<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.030> take<00:03:13.450> the

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
screws here which enable you to take the

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.099 
screws here which enable you to take the
scales<00:03:14.409> off<00:03:15.299> refit<00:03:16.299> new<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.689> as<00:03:16.840> if<00:03:16.930> they<00:03:17.019> were

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
scales off refit new one as if they were

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.770 
scales off refit new one as if they were
to<00:03:17.230> get<00:03:17.409> damaged<00:03:17.769> or<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.760> put<00:03:19.120> new<00:03:19.329> handle

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780

could<00:03:22.180> change<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.480> wood<00:03:22.659> or<00:03:22.870> whatever<00:03:23.430> that's

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
could change the wood or whatever that's

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.849 
could change the wood or whatever that's
a<00:03:24.609> really<00:03:24.939> good<00:03:25.060> feature<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:26.169> I<00:03:26.319> like<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.829> a

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
a really good feature and I like that a

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:34.649 
a really good feature and I like that a
lot<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:30.370> knife<00:03:30.930> overall<00:03:32.189> is<00:03:33.189> it's<00:03:34.180> hard<00:03:34.449> to

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
lot so the knife overall is it's hard to

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.930 
lot so the knife overall is it's hard to
fault<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:37.019> feel<00:03:38.019> of<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.379> good<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.949> like

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
fault it the feel of it is good I like

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.030 
fault it the feel of it is good I like
this<00:03:40.090> clip<00:03:40.359> point<00:03:40.540> blade<00:03:40.690> anyway<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.440> certainly

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
this clip point blade anyway I certainly

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.710 
this clip point blade anyway I certainly
like<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.280> handles<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.180> feels<00:03:43.419> good<00:03:43.599> in

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
like the handles and it feels good in

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.030 
like the handles and it feels good in
your<00:03:43.750> hand<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.739> thick<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.310> solid<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:47.040> think

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
your hand it's thick it's solid I think

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.069 
your hand it's thick it's solid I think
all<00:03:48.159> I'll<00:03:48.250> do<00:03:48.400> I'll<00:03:48.609> do<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.790> few<00:03:49.000> tests<00:03:49.389> on

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
all I'll do I'll do a few tests on

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.580 
all I'll do I'll do a few tests on
September<00:03:50.709> 1st<00:03:51.669> the<00:03:51.760> omit<00:03:52.060> perform<00:03:52.389> is

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
September 1st the omit perform is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.539 
September 1st the omit perform is
sharpness<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.829> want<00:03:53.949> to<00:03:54.010> test<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.340> see<00:03:54.489> if

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
sharpness I just want to test it see if

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.969 
sharpness I just want to test it see if
it'll<00:03:54.669> cut<00:03:54.879> through<00:03:56.489> absolutely<00:03:57.489> no<00:03:57.639> problem

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
it'll cut through absolutely no problem

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.490 
it'll cut through absolutely no problem
that's<00:03:59.979> shaping<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.579> hairs<00:04:00.759> off<00:04:00.939> my<00:04:01.150> arm

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
that's shaping the hairs off my arm

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.409 
that's shaping the hairs off my arm
hopefully<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.590> can<00:04:02.709> see<00:04:02.949> that<00:04:06.000> no<00:04:07.000> problem<00:04:07.329> at

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
hopefully you can see that no problem at

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:13.909 
hopefully you can see that no problem at
all<00:04:07.629> ok<00:04:08.349> a<00:04:08.530> good<00:04:09.220> indicator<00:04:09.729> of<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.810> sharp<00:04:11.079> knife

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.170 

next

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
next

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.449 
next
just<00:04:16.900> will<00:04:17.079> choke<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.739> on<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.190> see<00:04:18.310> if<00:04:18.370> we

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
just will choke down on it and see if we

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.189 
just will choke down on it and see if we
can<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:18.669> some<00:04:18.850> nice<00:04:19.030> slivers<00:04:21.780> there<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.930> go

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.570 

we'll<00:04:26.199> try<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.500> will<00:04:26.800> choke<00:04:27.009> right<00:04:27.340> down

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
we'll try that will choke right down

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.790 
we'll try that will choke right down
onto<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:27.910> blade<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.639> certainly<00:04:34.000> comes

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
onto the blade so it certainly comes

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.909 
onto the blade so it certainly comes
sharp<00:04:35.800> enough<00:04:37.050> not<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.229> have<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.620> worry<00:04:39.660> about

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
sharp enough not to have to worry about

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.939 
sharp enough not to have to worry about
resetting<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.130> blade<00:04:42.370> or<00:04:42.580> anything<00:04:43.949> so

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
resetting the blade or anything so

00:04:44.949 --> 00:05:11.700 
resetting the blade or anything so
that's<00:04:45.100> working<00:04:45.490> well

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.650
