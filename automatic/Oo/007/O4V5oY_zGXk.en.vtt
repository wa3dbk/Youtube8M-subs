the<00:00:57.090> reason<00:00:57.390> messes<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> list<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.500> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the reason messes on this list is that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
the reason messes on this list is that
with<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.070> Q<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.399> such<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> short<00:00:59.910> cooldown<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
with his Q on such a short cooldown it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
with his Q on such a short cooldown it
really<00:01:01.079> takes<00:01:01.320> no<00:01:01.530> time<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
really takes no time at all to get

really takes no time at all to get
stanked<00:01:02.609> plus<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.449> build<00:01:03.629> almost<00:01:03.899> 100%
