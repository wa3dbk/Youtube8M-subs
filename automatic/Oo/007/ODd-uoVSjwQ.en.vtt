00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 fennels are hardly found 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 au gratin well it is a recipe 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.189
 very simple but the method will be like 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.699
 we're going to cook them that will make it 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.489
 really delicious this dish what there 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:40.110
 it takes a pound and a half of half fennel 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.870
 liter of breadcrumb oil and pour 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.909
 but let's go through the preparation and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.299
 if we clean all the fennel we will go to 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:01:01.530
 stories for all as more that we do not 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:01:04.760
 need also remove the bare parts and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.760
 then we go to cool it 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.000
 and after that we will pass out to the water 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:28.230
 is about to boil almost like that we see i 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 fennel and the bordino market will have to 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:43.170
 stay only one minute chin e 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 half we dip the pinocchios of the water and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 they will have to take on a little more color 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.000
 dark 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.150
 at this point we can remove the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 fennel and now we see to dispose in 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:02.580
 a baking pan 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:07.950
 so let's put the oil it is important that 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.430
 we put people downstairs and so there 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.269
 let's settle everything right now by 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.900
 also inside 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:32.570
 and so we can add the oil inside 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.420
 that to go to flour and we will put them 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.320

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.150
 surely they won't be dry 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.970
