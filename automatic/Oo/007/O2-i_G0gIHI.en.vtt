but in our relationships and in our
thinking<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:18.250> can<00:01:18.610> be<00:01:18.729> very<00:01:19.090> detrimental

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
thinking it can be very detrimental

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.770

because what it causes us to do is to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.889 
because what it causes us to do is to
then<00:01:22.990> label<00:01:23.829> things<00:01:24.149> very<00:01:25.149> quickly<00:01:25.509> even

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
then label things very quickly even

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.139 
then label things very quickly even
before<00:01:26.649> we<00:01:26.829> even<00:01:26.950> become<00:01:27.340> conscious<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:27.969> it

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
before we even become conscious of it

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.730 
before we even become conscious of it
but<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:28.630> take<00:01:28.810> conscious<00:01:29.229> control<00:01:29.409> this

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
but we can take conscious control this

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.160 
but we can take conscious control this
process<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.579> label<00:01:31.000> things<00:01:31.180> as<00:01:31.360> bad<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.020> good

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
process we label things as bad and good

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.139 
process we label things as bad and good
and<00:01:32.380> when<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.189> do<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.369> when<00:01:33.609> we<00:01:33.640> say<00:01:33.850> this<00:01:34.000> is

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
and when we do that when we say this is

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.630 
and when we do that when we say this is
bad<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:34.600> we<00:01:34.659> do<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.960> quickly<00:01:35.229> we<00:01:36.070> actually

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
bad and we do that quickly we actually

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.749 
bad and we do that quickly we actually
limit<00:01:37.000> our<00:01:37.180> ability<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:38.380> find<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:39.070> value<00:01:39.549> in

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
limit our ability to find the value in

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.270 
limit our ability to find the value in
that<00:01:40.030> thing<00:01:40.359> we<00:01:41.229> limit<00:01:41.619> our<00:01:41.770> ability<00:01:42.070> to

that thing we limit our ability to

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.240 
that thing we limit our ability to
actually<00:01:43.119> open<00:01:43.600> our<00:01:43.960> minds<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:44.560> see<00:01:44.859> what<00:01:45.130> we

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
actually open our minds and see what we

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.429 
actually open our minds and see what we
could<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.549> benefited<00:01:46.090> from<00:01:46.119> from<00:01:46.960> learning

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
could have benefited from from learning

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.730 
could have benefited from from learning
from<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:48.250> relationship<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:49.659> we<00:01:50.020> close<00:01:50.439> our

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
from that relationship we we close our

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.859 
from that relationship we we close our
minds<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.700> good<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.420> becomes<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.840> very

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
minds to the good and it becomes a very

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.469 
minds to the good and it becomes a very
rigid<00:01:53.500> way<00:01:53.859> of<00:01:54.009> thinking<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.549> very<00:01:54.759> rigid<00:01:55.119> way

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
rigid way of thinking a very rigid way

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.990 
rigid way of thinking a very rigid way
of<00:01:55.780> thinking<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.920> behaving<00:01:57.460> in<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.820> world

of thinking and behaving in the world

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.330 
of thinking and behaving in the world
that<00:01:58.630> then<00:01:58.840> limits<00:01:59.200> our<00:01:59.320> ability<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.859> find<00:02:00.159> new

that then limits our ability to find new

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.679 
that then limits our ability to find new
opportunities<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:01.060> new<00:02:01.329> possibilities

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
opportunities and new possibilities

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.200 
opportunities and new possibilities
because<00:02:02.619> really<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.039> universe<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.609> infinite

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
because really the universe is infinite

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.480 
because really the universe is infinite
possibility<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.140> our<00:02:05.679> lives<00:02:05.950> can<00:02:06.189> become

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
possibility and our lives can become

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.340 
possibility and our lives can become
infinite<00:02:06.880> possibility<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.659> we<00:02:07.869> can<00:02:08.050> become

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
infinite possibility and we can become

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.570 
infinite possibility and we can become
infinite<00:02:08.740> possibility<00:02:09.340> when<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:10.030> embrace

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
infinite possibility when we embrace

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.630 
infinite possibility when we embrace
non-judgmental<00:02:12.580> ism<00:02:12.849> being<00:02:13.409> non-judgmental

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
non-judgmental ism being non-judgmental

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.580 
non-judgmental ism being non-judgmental
so<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.239> tall<00:02:16.510> order<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.290> might<00:02:17.440> be

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
so it is a tall order you might be

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.809 
so it is a tall order you might be
saying<00:02:17.830> well<00:02:18.069> how<00:02:18.280> can

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
saying well how can

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.110 
saying well how can
I<00:02:18.849> become<00:02:19.299> non-judgmental<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.790> society<00:02:21.790> my

I wonder what that what what what the

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.300 
I wonder what that what what what the
possibilities<00:04:04.629> lie<00:04:04.840> in<00:04:05.019> this<00:04:05.139> situation<00:04:05.919> what

the<00:04:06.430> possibilities<00:04:07.090> lie<00:04:07.419> with<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:08.290> new<00:04:08.819> item

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
the possibilities lie with this new item

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.550 
the possibilities lie with this new item
that<00:04:10.209> has<00:04:10.329> entered<00:04:10.509> my<00:04:10.859> reality<00:04:11.859> my<00:04:12.189> awareness

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
that has entered my reality my awareness

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.899 
that has entered my reality my awareness
is<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.709> interesting<00:04:15.129> thing<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.459> most<00:04:15.669> things

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
is the interesting thing is most things

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.009 
is the interesting thing is most things
that<00:04:15.969> we<00:04:16.120> observe<00:04:16.389> are<00:04:16.539> actually<00:04:16.840> first

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
that we observe are actually first

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.770 
that we observe are actually first
created<00:04:17.469> in<00:04:17.590> our<00:04:17.620> minds<00:04:17.889> anyways<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.909> so<00:04:18.969> why

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
created in our minds anyways and so why

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.649 
created in our minds anyways and so why
would<00:04:19.810> we<00:04:20.079> judge<00:04:20.380> something<00:04:20.889> that<00:04:21.280> we<00:04:21.659> have

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
would we judge something that we have

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.070 
would we judge something that we have
created<00:04:22.990> why<00:04:23.530> would<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:23.949> try<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.750> limit<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
created why would we try to limit the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.990 
created why would we try to limit the
possibilities<00:04:26.830> of<00:04:27.070> what<00:04:27.310> we<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.490> create<00:04:27.909> in

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
possibilities of what we can create in

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.969 
possibilities of what we can create in
our<00:04:28.120> life<00:04:28.330> through<00:04:28.810> judging<00:04:29.349> things<00:04:29.620> as<00:04:29.800> good

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
our life through judging things as good

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.090 
our life through judging things as good
or<00:04:30.039> bad

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100

to move forward and contemplate and
think<00:05:12.410> about<00:05:12.620> things<00:05:13.150> so<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:14.420> a<00:05:14.540> very<00:05:14.780> big

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
think about things so it's a very big

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.590 
think about things so it's a very big
topic<00:05:15.440> it's<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.950> very<00:05:16.220> big<00:05:16.490> concept<00:05:17.150> but

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
topic it's a very big concept but

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.360 
topic it's a very big concept but
there's<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.840> lot<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.290> power<00:05:18.590> in<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:18.950> so<00:05:19.100> I<00:05:19.160> don't

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
there's a lot of power in it so I don't

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.810 
there's a lot of power in it so I don't
want<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.940> judge<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.540> concept<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.820> and

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820
