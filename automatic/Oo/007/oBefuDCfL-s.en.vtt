now in terms of processor Samsung didn't
mention<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.939> two<00:01:51.090> processes<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
mention there be two processes one of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
mention there be two processes one of
course<00:01:52.259> would<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> Exynos<00:01:53.070> 5<00:01:53.280> processor

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
course would be the Exynos 5 processor

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.580 
course would be the Exynos 5 processor
which<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.270> course<00:01:54.329> has<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.720> killer<00:01:55.200> specs

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
which of course has this killer specs

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
which of course has this killer specs
it's<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:57.770> multi<00:01:58.770> quorum<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.909> core

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it's that multi quorum you know a core

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
it's that multi quorum you know a core
system<00:02:00.869> whatever<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.530> super<00:02:02.430> crazy<00:02:02.579> stuff

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
system whatever it is super crazy stuff

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
system whatever it is super crazy stuff
and<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.689> course<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.140> also<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.500> these

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and of course you can also get these

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
and of course you can also get these
Snapdragon<00:02:05.340> 600<00:02:06.149> which<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.479> likely<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:07.170> will

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
Snapdragon 600 which was likely we will

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100 
Snapdragon 600 which was likely we will
get<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.009> US<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.090> 2<00:02:09.330> gigs<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.660> ram<00:02:09.869> in

you look away from your screen the video

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.870 
you look away from your screen the video
will<00:03:03.630> pause<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.440> then<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.190> continue<00:03:05.670> if

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
will pause and then you can continue if

you look back on the screen I'm sure

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.199 
you look back on the screen I'm sure
that'd<00:03:07.500> probably<00:03:07.709> work<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.160> videos<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
that'd probably work with videos on the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.699 
that'd probably work with videos on the
system<00:03:09.570> probably<00:03:09.840> not<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.230> YouTube<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
system probably not on YouTube and

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.870 
system probably not on YouTube and
things<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:11.160> who<00:03:11.400> knows<00:03:11.550> what<00:03:11.760> will

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
things like that but who knows what will

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.090 
things like that but who knows what will
happen<00:03:11.910> with<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.360> when<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.170> device<00:03:13.470> finally

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
happen with that when the device finally

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.789 
happen with that when the device finally
launches<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:15.480> also<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.930> things<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
launches you also have things like the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
smart scrolling you have the air view

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.990 
smart scrolling you have the air view
where<00:03:19.260> which<00:03:19.739> was<00:03:20.010> available<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.700> which<00:03:20.850> is

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
now you can do that on the galaxy s4

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.710 
now you can do that on the galaxy s4
with<00:03:25.680> your<00:03:25.830> finger<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.820> basically<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.540> hover
