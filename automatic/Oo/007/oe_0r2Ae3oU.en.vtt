00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello everybody I'm emanuele this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.740
 clearly today we will talk about the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.230
 tourette jeans syndrome that a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.589
 despite the name , many know what 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589
 we're talking about 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 because I said that many will know of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.840
 what are we talking about because this 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.430
 syndrome is a feature that has it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 made quite famous as it is 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.119
 also appeared in episodes of the Simpsons and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.529
 of south park but let's go with order 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.570
 the gilles de la tourette syndrome 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.550
 also called simply the syndrome of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.260
 tourette is a pathology that has several 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.879
 symptoms including especially tic 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.690
 engines therefore uncontrolled movements 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.829
 and tic sound then the sound emission 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.150
 involuntary and within these sounds it falls 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.339
 the feature that makes this 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.600
 the fact is such a peculiar syndrome 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.670
 that sometimes can come out 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 bad words or very offensive phrases 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.299
 technically this is called coprolalia 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 but in practice it consists in sending 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.839
 fuck off people in an uncontrolled way 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.610
 without knowing it now I know it could 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.500
 seem like a nice thing but it is not 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 not at all it is a problem 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.040
 which can also be quite serious 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 but to think about it is not so beautiful 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.610
 risk offending people without it 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.439
 be able to control yourself fortunately anyway 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.780
 it is the disorder that appears on the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 tournament years and disappears in adolescence 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 so it's generally not a thing 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.150
 criticism and fortunately it isn't either 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 the origin of the syndrome is so frequent 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.509
 of tourette is still not very clear e 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 there are three different hypotheses that al 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.390
 moment may be plausible and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 on which the is focusing 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.070
 research the first hypothesis to consist of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.510
 foundas ie pediatric autoimmune europ 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 so afrique disordes society 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.350
 whistler pig live action that translated 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 it would be pediatric disorders 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.950
 auto immune neuropsychiatrists from 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.260
 streptococcal infections 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.240
 here now I take advantage of it to do a 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.110
 appeal to the guys who put the names on 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.880
 illnesses 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.979
 dear dudes that you put the names to 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 diseases you could call it more 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.460
 Christian please I want to say if I go 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.080
 in the hospital doing a check on mine 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.790
 son now that I write to the doctor 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.710
 have diagnosed a pediatric 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.540
 autoimmune neuropsychiatrists need the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.460
 society of the right whist top live action 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.810
 understand that the doctor ends the shift 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.330
 it is not a beautiful thing 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 however that are their bandas are 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.440
 disorders caused by a bacterium that is 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.050
 called streptococcus there are several 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.030
 tight types with koman 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 the point the point is that the narrow coconut 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.200
 attacks the brain with mechanisms 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.700
 absorbable details arrive on 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 our body's bacterium goes crazy and 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 produces maretta antibodies creating damage 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.460
 everywhere to include a disease 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.080
 in the bandas it takes some requirements 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.330
 the presence of an obsessive disorder 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.970
 compulsive or the presence of tic la 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.410
 appearance of symptoms in childhood 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.330
 neurological abnormalities and association 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.110
 temporal between the infection is the appearance 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.730
 of symptoms 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.620
 if you remember syntonies of the rap act 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.850
 it could come back but let's move on 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.040
 with the second hypothesis there is that 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.990
 genetics in particular could 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.520
 focus on the chromosome hicks 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.350
 also in consideration of the fact that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.450
 a syndrome that generally affects i 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.730
 finally the third hypothesis concerns males 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.020
 the anatomical normality, that is alterations 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.970
 in the structure of the brain 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.830
 if it then interests someone, it seems 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.390
 the cerebral ventricles are diminished 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.920
 compared to a healthy person and you are there 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.930
 of anatomical dysfunctions also i 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.610
 basal ganglia you understood nothing 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500
 no problem it doesn't seem that either 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.030
 researchers are understanding us a lot 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.740
 in short, to research into causes such as 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.540
 you will understand is quite uncertain 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.250
 however as safe the syndrome of 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.570
 tourette let's start from considering that 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.220
 as we said before it could 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.810
 then disappear in adolescence 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.850
 It would only serve a maintenance is 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.380
 a real care in any case for 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.930
 mild forms do not use drugs 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.620
 but psychological therapy e 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.420
 behavioral in the most serious cases 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.160
 instead it seems that the expert wing can 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.180
 have positive results in 80 per 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.520
 one hundred cases 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.870
 and I believe I would add I shout it 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.150
 lennon sedative used for example 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.459
 in psychotic syndromes so I want 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.200
 say pretty much anyway 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.730
 obviously any therapy must be 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.860
 discussed with the doctor at 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.180
 psychologist based on the cases if it can be 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.280
 interesting it seems that even Mozart 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.110
 suffered from tourette syndrome e 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.000
 some believe that the soa francs 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.310
 but even if it is not clear if you swear 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.720
 are due to the tourette or billions 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.920
 that they procure when they are put up 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.780
 case amid rap songs 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.250
 I still hope that guests enjoyed 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.250
 and we'll see you next Saturday
