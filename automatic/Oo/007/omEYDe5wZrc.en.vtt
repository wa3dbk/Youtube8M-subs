today I'm going to answer a question
that<00:00:29.160> I've<00:00:29.429> been<00:00:29.580> asked<00:00:30.060> quite<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> bit<00:00:30.779> which

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that I've been asked quite a bit which

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
that I've been asked quite a bit which
scale<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> use<00:00:32.550> over<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> cord<00:00:33.420> we're

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
scale can I use over this cord we're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
scale can I use over this cord we're
going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> take<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> problem<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.770> flip<00:00:35.399> it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
going to take the problem and flip it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940 
going to take the problem and flip it
around<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:36.120> order<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> lead<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> coherence

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
around in order for a lead to coherence

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.610 
around in order for a lead to coherence
and<00:00:38.129> work<00:00:38.579> over<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> corridor<00:00:39.629> series<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.260> cords

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and work over a corridor series of cords

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.880 
and work over a corridor series of cords
there<00:00:41.309> needs<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.149> connection<00:00:42.629> between

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
there needs to be a connection between

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.930 
there needs to be a connection between
we're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> take<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> closer<00:00:44.520> look<00:00:44.670> at

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we're going to take a closer look at

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.380 
we're going to take a closer look at
that<00:00:45.059> connection<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.030> they're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that connection and they're going to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
that connection and they're going to
start<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.800> scale<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.399> opposed<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
start with the scale as opposed to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
start with the scale as opposed to
starting<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.539> core<00:00:51.809> let's<00:00:52.230> consider<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
starting with the core let's consider a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.569 
starting with the core let's consider a
scale<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.390> will<00:00:54.390> work<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.110> frigate<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.489> I'm

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
scale and will work in a frigate so I'm

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
scale and will work in a frigate so I'm
going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> big<00:00:57.270> blank<00:00:57.570> fretboard<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
going to take a big blank fretboard and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
going to take a big blank fretboard and
each<00:00:58.590> time<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> seven<00:00:59.879> notes

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
each time I have one or the seven notes

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.939 
each time I have one or the seven notes
of<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.510> Phrygian<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> dot<00:01:01.920> on

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
of a Phrygian I'm going to put a dot on

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
of a Phrygian I'm going to put a dot on
their<00:01:02.280> big<00:01:02.789> fretboard<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:04.290> check<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
their big fretboard let's check it out

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.670 
their big fretboard let's check it out
all<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.159> dots<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.850> possible<00:01:06.510> notes<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
all these dots are possible notes that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
all these dots are possible notes that
are<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> create<00:01:08.250> chords<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.840> will

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
are going to create chords that will

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
are going to create chords that will
work<00:01:10.710> over<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> scale<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.390> dealing

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
work over the scale that you're dealing

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
work over the scale that you're dealing
with<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.430> be

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
creative and pick some of these dots and

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
creative and pick some of these dots and
try<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:19.130> quartz<00:01:20.130> whether<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
try to come up with quartz whether you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
try to come up with quartz whether you
know<00:01:20.909> their<00:01:21.060> name<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> court<00:01:21.630> or<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
know their name of the court or not it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.679 
know their name of the court or not it
doesn't<00:01:22.110> matter<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.210> record<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.330> chords

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
doesn't matter and record these chords

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.899 
doesn't matter and record these chords
and<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.439> happens<00:01:25.770> make<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and see what happens make sure that you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.999 
and see what happens make sure that you
keep<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.240> steady<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> base<00:01:28.290> you're<00:01:28.829> going

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
keep a steady a on the base you're going

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.090 
keep a steady a on the base you're going
to<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> series<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.150> chords<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> lot

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to have a series of a chords with a lot

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.620 
to have a series of a chords with a lot
of<00:01:32.130> different<00:01:32.549> embellishments<00:01:32.759> these

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of different embellishments these

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
of different embellishments these
embellishments<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> work<00:01:35.310> over

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
embellishments are going to work over

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.800 
embellishments are going to work over
the<00:01:36.720> scale<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:38.220> took<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> scale<00:01:38.939> took

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the scale because we took the scale took

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
the scale because we took the scale took
several<00:01:40.079> notes<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> scale<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.100> created

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
several notes of the scale and created

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
several notes of the scale and created
chords<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> strong<00:01:43.200> connection

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
chords now we have a strong connection

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.370 
chords now we have a strong connection
between<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.790> scale<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.810> core<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
between the scale and the core this is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499
