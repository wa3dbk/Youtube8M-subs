00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
using vanilla flavour just because

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.120 
using vanilla flavour just because
that's<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.320> open<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> really

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that's what I have open but it really

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
that's what I have open but it really
doesn't<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> difference<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.150> you're

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
doesn't make a difference and you're

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.240 
doesn't make a difference and you're
just<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.110> measure<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.740> cup<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just gonna measure out one cup of that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.410 
just gonna measure out one cup of that
to<00:01:41.490> start<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.850> add<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.390> your

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to start then you add that to your

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.920 
to start then you add that to your
chocolate<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> you're<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.680> mix<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
chocolate and you're gonna mix it in I

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
chocolate and you're gonna mix it in I
like<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> mix<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.439> by<00:01:52.619> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.950> folding<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
like to mix it in by kind of folding the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.630 
like to mix it in by kind of folding the
chocolate<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:55.140> other<00:01:55.290> rice<00:01:55.409> krispies<00:01:55.890> just

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
chocolate over other rice krispies just

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.179 
chocolate over other rice krispies just
I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.360> helps<00:01:57.659> stop<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.469> breakage<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
I think this helps stop the breakage of

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
I think this helps stop the breakage of
the<00:01:59.250> rice<00:01:59.399> krispies<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.479> do

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the rice krispies but you can do

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
the rice krispies but you can do
whatever<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:03.649> now<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> little

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
whatever you like now this is a little

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.800 
whatever you like now this is a little
trick<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
trick I like to do I like to kind of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
trick I like to do I like to kind of
push<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.350> chocolate<00:02:07.710> rice<00:02:07.860> krispies<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> one

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
push the chocolate rice krispies to one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.249 
push the chocolate rice krispies to one
side<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.479> still<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> lot<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
side and if I still see a lot of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.420 
side and if I still see a lot of
liquidity<00:02:10.800> aqil<00:02:11.190> --it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
liquidity aqil --it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.880 
liquidity aqil --it
then<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> add<00:02:12.300> more

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
then I like to add more

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.830 
then I like to add more
crispies<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:13.819> you're<00:02:14.030> into<00:02:14.360> having<00:02:14.660> more

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
crispies but if you're into having more

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.140 
crispies but if you're into having more
chocolate<00:02:15.350> than<00:02:15.650> krispies<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:16.850> go<00:02:17.060> ahead

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
chocolate than krispies then go ahead

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:29.610 
chocolate than krispies then go ahead
and<00:02:17.300> leave<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.140> last<00:02:18.470> quarter<00:02:19.310> cup<00:02:19.550> out

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.140 

so<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:30.860> mix<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.370> until<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:31.910> fully

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
so just mix that in until it's fully

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.940 
so just mix that in until it's fully
integrated<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:36.560> we're<00:02:36.830> going

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
integrated like this and now we're going

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
integrated like this and now we're going
to<00:02:37.010> align<00:02:37.220> our<00:02:37.490> cookie<00:02:37.880> sheet<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.600> put<00:02:38.750> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
to align our cookie sheet to put the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990 
to align our cookie sheet to put the
clusters<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.340> use<00:02:40.370> baking<00:02:40.700> paper

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
clusters on and you can use baking paper

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.660 
clusters on and you can use baking paper
or<00:02:41.360> wax<00:02:41.510> paper<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.170> now<00:02:42.980> we're<00:02:43.220> gonna<00:02:43.310> scoop

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
or wax paper and now we're gonna scoop

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.790 
or wax paper and now we're gonna scoop
out<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.850> clusters<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:45.080> do<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.530> can<00:02:45.680> use

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
out the clusters to do that you can use

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.070 
out the clusters to do that you can use
a<00:02:45.830> tablespoon<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.610> cookie<00:02:46.910> scooper<00:02:47.360> or<00:02:47.690> an<00:02:47.990> ice

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
a tablespoon a cookie scooper or an ice

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.050 
a tablespoon a cookie scooper or an ice
cream<00:02:48.320> scooper<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:48.890> I'm<00:02:49.340> using<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.760> cookie

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
cream scooper and I'm using this cookie

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.090 
cream scooper and I'm using this cookie
scooper<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.410> like<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.980> use

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
scooper here it's what I like to use

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.190 
scooper here it's what I like to use
it's<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.310> easiest<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:52.940> me<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.990> gives

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
dollop of that and just put it on the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.210 
dollop of that and just put it on the
cookie<00:02:59.180> sheet<00:02:59.230> it's<00:03:00.230> really<00:03:00.650> simple<00:03:00.860> just

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
cookie sheet it's really simple just

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.510 
cookie sheet it's really simple just
keep<00:03:02.150> putting<00:03:02.600> clusters<00:03:03.290> down<00:03:03.530> until<00:03:04.400> you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
keep putting clusters down until you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.070 
keep putting clusters down until you
have<00:03:04.730> no<00:03:05.210> mixture<00:03:05.600> left

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
have no mixture left

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.760

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
I got about 17 large clusters from this

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.870 
I got about 17 large clusters from this
and<00:03:09.770> once<00:03:09.980> you're<00:03:10.160> done<00:03:10.280> you're<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.610> gonna
