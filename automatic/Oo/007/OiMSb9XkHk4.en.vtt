00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.640
 They thought right push will be supported 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.440
 the two good the guy who is the director 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 Creative game's executive director 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.899
 game that is jonathan dies and he said 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.219
 that yes since how to launch the best of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.090
 was already developing the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.640
 second version 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
 but this time they'll be bolder 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 how much more used will they try 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 put some games some 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 games a few gameplay style 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.809
 in-game mechanics that can be 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 you do not like it or you might like it 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.059
 many players things that do not exist 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.470
 today they are working 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.830
 fortunately for this to be something else that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.590
 jonathan dies on the stairs near death 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.299
 a director there he said that they are 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.340
 constantly interviewing the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.890
 players and also looking at all the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 forums about the game to know the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.850
 that the guys who make it a game and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.540
 This time they can not go wrong can not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.659
 put a game that is sensational 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.049
 than people are looking for something else 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 that omar spoke on the subject of narrative 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.680
 he said one thing they did not 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.560
 can sin in making a very 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.110
 extended very well this very complicated 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150
 but to let the player make his 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.579
 own history as the game world 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 has opened up to the point where a person has 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.100
 a certain narrative and a certain side 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.869
 to make your story the player to do 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.280
 another story then what he one 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.189
 of the things he most wants to work on 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.439
 not to leave the legislative kucinich 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.079
 and let the player 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.520
 simply have fun with the next 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.890
 open world game that will be 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.220
