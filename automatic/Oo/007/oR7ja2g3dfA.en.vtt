most<00:00:06.259> of<00:00:06.470> the<00:00:06.590> paintings<00:00:07.009> start<00:00:07.460> with<00:00:08.420> a

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
most of the paintings start with a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.490 
most of the paintings start with a
chaotic<00:00:08.900> state

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
chaotic state

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.590 
chaotic state
and<00:00:09.950> if<00:00:10.520> they'll<00:00:10.760> start<00:00:11.180> there<00:00:11.360> they<00:00:11.480> get

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
and if they'll start there they get

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.110 
and if they'll start there they get
there<00:00:11.780> pretty<00:00:11.959> quickly<00:00:12.550> this<00:00:13.550> is<00:00:13.610> back<00:00:13.940> and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
there pretty quickly this is back and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.879 
there pretty quickly this is back and
forth<00:00:14.179> between<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:15.200> painting<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:15.679> myself

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
forth between the painting and myself

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.760 
forth between the painting and myself
where<00:00:16.750> for<00:00:17.750> a<00:00:17.779> while<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.259> paintings<00:00:18.619> in

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
where for a while the paintings in

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.190 
where for a while the paintings in
charge<00:00:19.009> and<00:00:19.220> then<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.970> take<00:00:20.330> a<00:00:20.360> little<00:00:20.599> I<00:00:20.840> rest<00:00:21.050> a

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
charge and then I take a little I rest a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.450 
charge and then I take a little I rest a
little<00:00:21.410> control<00:00:21.740> from<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.250> then<00:00:22.340> the

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
little control from it and then the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.790 
little control from it and then the
painting<00:00:22.760> overwhelms<00:00:23.210> me<00:00:23.420> again<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:23.900> the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
painting overwhelms me again and the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.290 
painting overwhelms me again and the
painting<00:00:25.100> becomes<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.460> fight<00:00:25.699> it's<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:26.000> struggle

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
painting becomes a fight it's a struggle

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.320 
painting becomes a fight it's a struggle
until<00:00:26.630> something<00:00:27.670> hopefully<00:00:28.670> on<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:28.939> good<00:00:29.180> day

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
until something hopefully on a good day

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.320 
until something hopefully on a good day
emerges<00:00:29.930> that<00:00:30.279> that's<00:00:31.279> worth<00:00:31.519> keeping<00:00:31.880> and

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
emerges that that's worth keeping and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.380 
emerges that that's worth keeping and
that<00:00:32.480> that<00:00:32.930> has<00:00:33.290> sustaining<00:00:34.100> value<00:00:34.519> when<00:00:35.269> you

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
that that has sustaining value when you

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.140 
that that has sustaining value when you
start<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.949> put<00:00:36.949> one<00:00:37.309> gray<00:00:37.580> next<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:37.940> another

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
start to put one gray next to another

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.619 
start to put one gray next to another
gray<00:00:38.540> you<00:00:38.750> see<00:00:38.989> that<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.040> fact<00:00:40.250> one<00:00:40.489> is<00:00:40.670> one

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
gray you see that in fact one is one

gray you see that in fact one is one

turns into a blue and the other into a
red<00:00:43.460> because<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.030> subtlety<00:00:44.479> starts<00:00:44.839> to

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
red because the subtlety starts to

red because the subtlety starts to

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
figure in the painting act as something

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.350 
figure in the painting act as something
to<00:00:51.650> sort<00:00:51.830> of<00:00:51.860> draw<00:00:52.129> your<00:00:52.369> energy<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.239> to

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
to sort of draw your energy and and to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.410 
to sort of draw your energy and and to
draw<00:00:53.570> your<00:00:53.869> attention<00:00:54.369> in<00:00:55.369> if<00:00:55.909> what<00:00:56.150> you<00:00:56.269> want

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
draw your attention in if what you want

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.700 
draw your attention in if what you want
to<00:00:56.479> do<00:00:56.570> is<00:00:56.659> experience<00:00:57.080> the<00:00:57.199> paint<00:00:57.470> in<00:00:57.619> the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
to do is experience the paint in the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.729 
to do is experience the paint in the
relationship<00:00:58.220> and<00:00:58.369> the<00:00:58.460> colors<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:59.650> sort<00:01:00.650> of

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
relationship and the colors it sort of

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.719 
relationship and the colors it sort of
centers<00:01:01.549> and<00:01:01.729> and<00:01:02.530> hones<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.860> experience<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
centers and and hones that experience so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.730 
centers and and hones that experience so
that<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.119> know<00:01:05.510> how<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.780> get<00:01:06.020> in<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.439> out<00:01:06.560> of

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
that you know how to get in and out of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.649 
that you know how to get in and out of
that<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.640> my<00:01:07.760> painting<00:01:08.150> is<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.390> sort<00:01:08.600> of

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
that so my painting is this sort of

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.250 
that so my painting is this sort of
hierarchical<00:01:09.560> system<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.280> ideas<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.270> you

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
hierarchical system of ideas and you you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.960 
hierarchical system of ideas and you you
can't<00:01:12.530> put<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.920> putting<00:01:13.460> down<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.700> first

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
can't put that putting down the first

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.520 
can't put that putting down the first
note<00:01:14.240> helps<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.750> think<00:01:14.930> about<00:01:15.200> what<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
note helps you think about what the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.500 
note helps you think about what the
second<00:01:15.890> might<00:01:16.130> be<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:17.060> have<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.300> sort<00:01:17.420> of

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
second might be and you have to sort of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.380 
second might be and you have to sort of
discover<00:01:17.870> that<00:01:18.140> as<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.440> go<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.640> find<00:01:19.970> what

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
discover that as you go you find what

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.090 
discover that as you go you find what
works<00:01:20.630> next<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.200> something<00:01:21.410> else<00:01:21.680> into<00:01:21.980> when

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
works next to something else into when

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.530 
works next to something else into when
it<00:01:22.220> doesn't<00:01:22.400> work<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.820> try<00:01:23.000> something<00:01:23.270> else

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
it doesn't work you try something else

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.540 
it doesn't work you try something else
and<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.440> keep<00:01:24.620> pushing<00:01:24.950> them<00:01:25.040> until<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.400> find

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
and you keep pushing them until you find

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.420 
and you keep pushing them until you find
something<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:25.970> surprises<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.870> works

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
something that surprises you and works

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.070 
something that surprises you and works
unexpectedly<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:29.120> that's<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.690> moment<00:01:29.870> of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
unexpectedly and that's the moment of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.560 
unexpectedly and that's the moment of
magic<00:01:30.230> what<00:01:31.190> I'm<00:01:31.280> trying<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.120> to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
magic what I'm trying to do is to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.750 
magic what I'm trying to do is to
approximate<00:01:33.500> my<00:01:34.460> what<00:01:35.330> I'm<00:01:35.450> feeling<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.440> to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
approximate my what I'm feeling and to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.070 
approximate my what I'm feeling and to
give<00:01:37.760> you<00:01:37.940> some<00:01:38.530> way<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:40.360> feel<00:01:41.360> some<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.870> that

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
give you some way to feel some of that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.410 
give you some way to feel some of that
so<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.070> when<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.430> come<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.000> painting

same<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.540> anxiety<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.470> I<00:01:58.830> put<00:01:59.159> into<00:01:59.310> it

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
same kind of anxiety that I put into it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.750 
same kind of anxiety that I put into it
or<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> same<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.590> comes<00:02:01.590> end<00:02:02.400> feeling

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
or the same kind of comes end feeling

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.490 
or the same kind of comes end feeling
that<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> put<00:02:03.330> into<00:02:03.479> whatever<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that I put into whatever it was that I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.710 
that I put into whatever it was that I
was<00:02:04.680> feeling<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.970> say<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.420> day<00:02:06.659> but

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
was feeling I don't say that day but

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.469 
was feeling I don't say that day but
over<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.800> expanse<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.610> time<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.360> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
over that expanse of time and that's I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.969 
over that expanse of time and that's I
think<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.380> interesting<00:02:10.500> things

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
think one of the interesting things

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
think one of the interesting things
about<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.310> large<00:02:11.550> paintings<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.150> particular

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
about the large paintings in particular

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.229 
about the large paintings in particular
is<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.190> many<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.370> them<00:02:14.580> most<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.090> them

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
is that many of them most of them

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.010 
is that many of them most of them
contain<00:02:15.720> both<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.380> Zen<00:02:17.310> day<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.330> an<00:02:18.810> anxious

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
contain both a Zen day and an anxious

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.880 
contain both a Zen day and an anxious
day<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.770> an<00:02:19.950> angry<00:02:20.670> day<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.650> maybe

day and an angry day and you know maybe

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.680 
day and an angry day and you know maybe
a<00:02:23.010> quiet<00:02:23.250> contemplative<00:02:23.970> day<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.600> know

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
a quiet contemplative day you know

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.199 
a quiet contemplative day you know
they're<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:25.590> put<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.010> those

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
they're they put all those

juxtapositions they are all contained

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.770 
juxtapositions they are all contained
within<00:02:28.410> one<00:02:28.920> painting<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> long

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
within one painting you can have a long

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.440 
within one painting you can have a long
relationship<00:02:31.709> with<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.070> painting<00:02:32.519> because

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
relationship with the painting because

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.940 
relationship with the painting because
every<00:02:33.720> day<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.900> bring<00:02:34.260> something<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
every day you bring something to it and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.350 
every day you bring something to it and
it's<00:02:35.070> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> feed<00:02:35.519> off<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.760> something<00:02:36.150> else

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's going to feed off of something else

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
it's going to feed off of something else
that<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.570> gave<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:38.280> going<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
that I gave to it and that's going to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.509 
that I gave to it and that's going to
build<00:02:38.790> into<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> serious<00:02:39.630> relationship<00:02:39.750> where

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
build into a serious relationship where

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.580 
build into a serious relationship where
you<00:02:41.519> are<00:02:41.790> learning<00:02:42.090> from<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> painting<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you are learning from the painting and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.100 
you are learning from the painting and
the<00:02:43.680> painting<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.160> learning<00:02:44.370> from<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:45.110> there

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
the painting is learning from you there

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.330 
the painting is learning from you there
days<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.290> I'm<00:02:46.560> having<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> good<00:02:47.040> day<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
days when I'm having a good day in the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.920 
days when I'm having a good day in the
model<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.640> having<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.970> bad<00:02:48.150> day<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.420> days<00:02:48.720> when

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
model is having a bad day and days when

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.330 
model is having a bad day and days when
the<00:02:49.019> model<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.440> having<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.800> good<00:02:49.980> day<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.250> I'm

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the model is having a good day and I'm

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.270 
the model is having a good day and I'm
having<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.790> bad<00:02:50.940> day<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.380> has<00:02:53.250> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
having a bad day all of that has to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.470 
having a bad day all of that has to
somehow<00:02:53.880> congeal<00:02:54.390> into<00:02:54.780> into<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.590> picture

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
somehow congeal into into one picture

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.130 
somehow congeal into into one picture
and<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.600> think<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.320> best<00:02:58.620> pictures<00:03:00.140> what

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and I think in the best pictures what

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.770 
and I think in the best pictures what
happens<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.190> quite<00:03:02.670> settle<00:03:03.150> there

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
happens is they don't quite settle there

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.940 
happens is they don't quite settle there
are<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:03.989> bits<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.620> them<00:03:04.739> sort<00:03:04.920> of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
are little bits of all of them sort of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
are little bits of all of them sort of
floating<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.579> shimmering<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.350> look

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
floating and shimmering and if you look

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.610 
floating and shimmering and if you look
at<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.799> from<00:03:08.100> one<00:03:08.760> angle<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.360> see<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.380> one

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
at it from one angle you see you see one

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.289 
at it from one angle you see you see one
piece<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.700> look<00:03:11.820> at<00:03:11.910> from<00:03:12.030> another

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
piece of and if you look at from another

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.470 
piece of and if you look at from another
angle<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.780> see<00:03:12.930> another<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.120> think<00:03:15.150> that's

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
angle you see another and I think that's

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.390 
angle you see another and I think that's
true<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.810> life<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.380> true<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.680> my<00:03:16.829> life<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.220> any

true to life it's true to my life in any

case that on my best days I'm still I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.380 
case that on my best days I'm still I
still<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.650> little<00:03:22.980> bit<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.610> anxiety

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
still have a little bit of that anxiety

or anger or trauma or whatever it is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.080

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
lurking in the background and on my

joy and surprise and excitement and they

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.280 
joy and surprise and excitement and they
the<00:03:34.950> richness<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.489> life<00:03:35.549> comes<00:03:36.120> from<00:03:36.290> weaving

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
the richness of life comes from weaving

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.560 
the richness of life comes from weaving
all<00:03:37.440> these<00:03:37.680> subtleties<00:03:38.070> together<00:03:38.609> it's<00:03:39.480> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
all these subtleties together it's a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.860 
all these subtleties together it's a
complicated<00:03:40.049> world<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.530> live<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.630> art<00:03:42.630> is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
complicated world we live and and art is

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.599 
complicated world we live and and art is
sort<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.260> way<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.410> sorting<00:03:43.859> all<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.340> out
