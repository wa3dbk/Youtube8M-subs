 studios from the more kotofeem broadcast this 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.650
 two things are completely different and it seemed to me 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.060
 that i just see utter idiot 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.039
 and complete in every sense of it 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.889
 words because when i looked later 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.500
 On the screen, my husband wrote down because 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.110
 was direct firms he wrote me 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.810
 directly from the TV when me 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.910
 waited there of course there was utter pokemon 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190
 I stretched out there so I thought mom 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.430
 dear probably there is generally time 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.080
 stop here but then I looked it up 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.270
 already in such a normal format and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.400
 ok of course bun he is general and 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.830
 bun has no matter how cool it is terrible to 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.950
 I Mandra fat shafts I think I Mandra 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.530
 I'm still fattening it seems to me I looked 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.660
 not very convincingly well, generally of course 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.380
 self-criticism she has always been inherent in me 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.050
 and well, I can say that I can be everything 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.680
 much worse so ok ok 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.320
