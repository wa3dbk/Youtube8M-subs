00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.560
 another goal and 60 of the river chest 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.900
 represented 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.269
 like dashed lines 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.889
 soon 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.259
 next to dulko counter ie in front of the counter and we have this window 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.439
 lighting event the kitchen 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.560
 the series still in the kitchen we will have a door that will give access to the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099
 to recover the land uol bah 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.160
 residence 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.239
 a door of 70 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.740
 by 2 and 10 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.860
 and bc says it has a closing line so it's bounded 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.890
 the limit 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.270
 this kitchen 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.550
 which is 50 centimeters with a bis bis de miguel 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220
 the floor 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.500
 part of the appeal will 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.020
 date of fixation 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 then going through all the design of the whole house plan 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.420
 we observe 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.880
 dashed line this dashed line 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.930
 who saw us at the rental plan 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.060
 that here is the reverse 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.200
 then represented a real gain and the projection of the hedge to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.850
 dashed line 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.940
 is occupying the projection of the roof 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.500
 while in the lease plan 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.090
 we had 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.980
 the representation 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.450
 by full lines because we were living 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.890
 both have given 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.390
 in the foreground now we're very close to him 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.210
 and with this extension of soda limiting 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.370
 the real power of residence 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.870
 The next we have 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.770
 the cut lines 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.040
 lines closer to dash and brings less to power said tracey point 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.250
 with the representation of aggression 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.340
 that the direction of travel 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.840
 of the high observer of the air direction 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.620
 until the direction br 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 observing the internal parts of the residence 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.840
 i teacher of cc 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.249
 paulo duration 2 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.929
 observing 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.339
 Also what happens in the kitchen 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:15.590
 in the bathroom 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.120
 in the 4th then what is happening with this representation 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.339
 and what this is going to be viewed 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.239
 so you need to do me well 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.239
 exactly from that cut 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.499
 If you give, you will demonstrate. 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.349
 the parts 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.099
 which are being requested in reading interpretation 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.029
 observe the region in the cut 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 abi 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.089
 What is happening to her? 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.949
 the building 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.999
 little piquet of the day to see 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.939
 we observe 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.149
 the projection of the average roof near the air 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.689
 as this residence possesses in Argentina there is a gaping team 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.939
 up to island and recommended packaging 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.689
 that meet each patient 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.099
 to slab 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.929
 not to compromise 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.829
 flagstone 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.520
 so normally if you design 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.449
 50 cent and west of tile bir al 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.659
 you 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.599
 makes fun with 35 to 40 centimeters giving this distance 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.629
 to avoid 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.899
 Do you worry about the projection streak? 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:45.019
 doubt nagle that is the biggest item that are the tvs so how do I think it is 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.239
 moved away more 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.359
 usually 50 centimeters 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.359
 then this re-presentation 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.709
 the first wall appears bathroom window 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.039
 then the bathroom window in terms of oil 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:05.079
 of one meter and 65 note that the recess of the prison he is marking 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.139
 45 centimeters 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.139
 then the window tries one meter and 65 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.199
 Incidentally the time window 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.169
 of territory mats olsson has five 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.370
 fifty centimeters high in 50 centimeters inside it until it reaches 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.630
 right foot 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.450
 that the part 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.120
 but low dealing with the bay 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.740
 in the inner straw 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.940
 observed effect 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.490
 the representation 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.389
 of the sanitary basin 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.389
 view laterally than on ice at conventions 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.940
 double of the bull 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.370
 suspended 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.439
 on the wall 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.789
 so we have the representation also list while 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.990
 following towards the br there appears a dvd player 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.050
 betis 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.899
 note that this box wall she does not go to the hotel 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.380
 it has a defined height up to a size 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.599
 bathroom door ie 2 meters r10 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.599
 she stands as wall to blocks 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.499
 following we cross 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:16.960
 to carry 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.599
 keane among the roll in a bathroom 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.499
 then I look at the conventions in the 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.870
 the representation on the wall 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.740
 so four lines 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.939
 and in 2011 presenting 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.620
 the door 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.510
 stop ahead messi praising we'll see a space defined by the door 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.550
 to give 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.099
 kitchen 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.110
 she is facing 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.650
 for the observer 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.620
 following what we have in the car 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.479
 the wall 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.529
 air was it will take place this 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.900
 that we have 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.789
 represented by a line 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.030
 according to him year mercilessly are already in the dining room 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.499
 there was a deviation or it was observed that he had been walking 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.710
 in the sense of reopening the midfielder here he took a few steps to 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.889
 forward and continued 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.830
 looking sideways 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.779
 so the bc of the team seems not to have cut and the br 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.020
 she comes the result 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.080
 he has been walking sideways 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.569
 then it stays upright means it has stopped 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.120
 gave spaces forward 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.520
 and continued sideways it was for tattoo of 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.659
 the dining room window 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.759
 so when he went through 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.180
 dinner room 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.199
 it was observed the re-presentation in the open cut 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:50.580
 from the dining room window the sill with one meter to loft one meter and 10 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.779
 mid-network 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.860
 zero point 50 without pepper 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.930
 Right foot 2 meters said yes 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.270
 so I stipulated 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.919
 the representation 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.919
 run here towards the observer 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.919
 in the next exercise you go 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.819
 develop activities 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.029
 making 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.029
 another representation in the cut the surplus 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:21.540
 and with that 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.569
 we start our part of 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.689
 cortez in the technical drawing 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.969
 representation of conventional plants
