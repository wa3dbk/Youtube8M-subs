00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I'm Lawrence Clark burg and I live in

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.379 
I'm Lawrence Clark burg and I live in
New<00:00:03.600> York

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.140 

your<00:00:10.389> typical<00:00:10.570> electric<00:00:11.290> bike<00:00:11.700> looks<00:00:12.700> like<00:00:12.910> a

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
your typical electric bike looks like a

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.900 
your typical electric bike looks like a
normal<00:00:13.660> bike<00:00:13.840> in<00:00:14.139> most<00:00:14.650> regards<00:00:14.799> except<00:00:15.429> if

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
normal bike in most regards except if

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.630 
normal bike in most regards except if
you<00:00:16.059> look<00:00:16.209> closely<00:00:16.450> you'll<00:00:16.810> notice<00:00:16.900> and<00:00:17.640> one

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
you look closely you'll notice and one

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.970 
you look closely you'll notice and one
of<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:19.090> hubs<00:00:19.480> of<00:00:19.869> one<00:00:20.259> of<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.470> wheels<00:00:20.710> is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
of the hubs of one of the wheels is

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.550 
of the hubs of one of the wheels is
slightly<00:00:21.310> larger<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.899> has<00:00:23.200> some<00:00:23.349> wires

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
slightly larger and has some wires

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.950 
slightly larger and has some wires
coming<00:00:23.860> out<00:00:24.009> of<00:00:24.160> it<00:00:24.279> so<00:00:24.970> that<00:00:25.270> is<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.750> motor

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
coming out of it so that is the motor

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.339 
coming out of it so that is the motor
it's<00:00:26.890> often<00:00:27.550> small<00:00:27.820> hard<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.390> tell<00:00:28.599> sometimes

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
it's often small hard to tell sometimes

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.299 
it's often small hard to tell sometimes
but<00:00:30.000> yeah<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.239> motors<00:00:31.630> part<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.800> wheel<00:00:32.980> of

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
but yeah the motors part of the wheel of

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.930 
but yeah the motors part of the wheel of
the<00:00:33.430> bike<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:34.570> we<00:00:35.020> call<00:00:35.200> that<00:00:35.230> an<00:00:35.620> electric<00:00:36.520> hub

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
the bike so we call that an electric hub

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.250 
the bike so we call that an electric hub
motor<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:39.179> okay<00:00:40.179> if<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.390> follow<00:00:40.690> those<00:00:40.929> wires

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
motor and okay if you follow those wires

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.340 
motor and okay if you follow those wires
up<00:00:41.620> from<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.129> motor<00:00:42.420> those<00:00:43.420> wires<00:00:44.019> will

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
up from the motor those wires will

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.610 
up from the motor those wires will
typically<00:00:44.710> go<00:00:44.980> into<00:00:45.460> some<00:00:45.789> kind<00:00:45.999> of<00:00:46.620> little

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
typically go into some kind of little

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.860 
typically go into some kind of little
black<00:00:47.829> box<00:00:48.249> and<00:00:48.609> that<00:00:49.269> is<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.629> motor

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
black box and that is the motor

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.399 
black box and that is the motor
controller<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.829> that's<00:00:51.399> some<00:00:51.670> electronics

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
controller and that's some electronics

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.160 
controller and that's some electronics
that's<00:00:53.409> necessary<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.609> spin<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.659> motor<00:00:55.809> and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
that's necessary to spin the motor and

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.489 
that's necessary to spin the motor and
it<00:00:56.940> puts<00:00:57.940> an<00:00:58.089> electric<00:00:58.480> current<00:00:58.690> exactly

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
it puts an electric current exactly

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.470 
it puts an electric current exactly
where<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.739> needs<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.010> be<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.579> attract<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.149> little

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
where it needs to be to attract a little

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.049 
where it needs to be to attract a little
magnet<00:01:01.839> on<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.050> motor<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.589> thereby<00:01:03.429> spin<00:01:03.850> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
magnet on the motor and thereby spin the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.870 
magnet on the motor and thereby spin the
wheel<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.890> if<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.130> follow<00:01:06.340> some<00:01:06.520> more

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
wheel and then if you follow some more

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.899 
wheel and then if you follow some more
wires<00:01:07.180> out<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.930> controller<00:01:08.580> you'll<00:01:09.580> see

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
wires out of that controller you'll see

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.720 
wires out of that controller you'll see
typically<00:01:10.870> on<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.140> handlebars<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.130> the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
typically on the handlebars is a the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.480 
typically on the handlebars is a the
throttle<00:01:13.120> Doda<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.410> throttle<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.220> this

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
throttle Doda the throttle is this

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.260 
throttle Doda the throttle is this
little<00:01:16.390> button<00:01:16.630> right<00:01:16.660> here<00:01:17.940> this<00:01:18.940> one<00:01:19.150> is<00:01:19.180> a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
little button right here this one is a

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.300 
little button right here this one is a
thumb<00:01:19.540> throttle<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.950> lot<00:01:21.100> like<00:01:21.280> a

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
thumb throttle it's a lot like a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.520 
thumb throttle it's a lot like a
motorcycle<00:01:21.670> throttle<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.990> I'm<00:01:23.140> often<00:01:23.320> you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
motorcycle throttle and I'm often you

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.560 
motorcycle throttle and I'm often you
press<00:01:24.100> your<00:01:24.280> thumb<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.730> button<00:01:25.030> or<00:01:25.240> twist

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
press your thumb on a button or twist

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.710 
press your thumb on a button or twist
your<00:01:25.830> twist<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.950> throttle<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.450> follow

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
your twist the throttle if you follow

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.170 
your twist the throttle if you follow
another<00:01:32.050> wire<00:01:32.740> out<00:01:33.160> of<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.430> controller<00:01:33.850> that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
another wire out of the controller that

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.000 
another wire out of the controller that
will<00:01:34.840> go<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:36.580> battery<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:38.890> is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
will go to the battery so this is

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.710 
will go to the battery so this is
basically<00:01:39.430> just<00:01:39.550> like<00:01:39.850> any<00:01:40.090> other<00:01:40.270> battery

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
basically just like any other battery

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.170 
basically just like any other battery
you<00:01:40.960> might<00:01:41.110> put<00:01:41.290> in<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.530> flashlight<00:01:42.040> or<00:01:42.310> some

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
you might put in a flashlight or some

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.980 
you might put in a flashlight or some
other<00:01:43.330> device<00:01:43.630> except<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.230> big<00:01:45.690> so<00:01:46.690> those<00:01:46.840> are

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
other device except is big so those are

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.750 
other device except is big so those are
the<00:01:47.110> parts<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.530> electric<00:01:48.280> bike<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.640> have

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
the parts of the electric bike you have

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.660 
the parts of the electric bike you have
the<00:01:48.910> electric<00:01:49.270> hub<00:01:49.480> motor<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
the electric hub motor and the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.870 
the electric hub motor and the
controller<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:53.080> throttle<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.520> battery

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
controller the throttle and the battery

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.109 
controller the throttle and the battery
so<00:01:55.330> that's<00:01:55.510> it

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.510 

boxy<00:01:59.750> bikes<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.170> more<00:02:00.560> than<00:02:00.770> just<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.100> store

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
boxy bikes is more than just a store

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.640 
boxy bikes is more than just a store
into<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.390> way<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.979> empower<00:02:03.979> people<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:05.650> find

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
into the way to empower people to find

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.130 
into the way to empower people to find
new<00:02:06.860> ways<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.580> getting<00:02:08.119> around<00:02:08.179> people<00:02:09.020> who
