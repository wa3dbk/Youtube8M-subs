but this is what will make it curdle and
we<00:00:56.930> need<00:00:57.080> three-quarters<00:00:57.949> of<00:00:57.979> a<00:00:58.129> teaspoon<00:00:58.309> of

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
taste and be blamed without the salt so

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.310

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
mix this in a little bit later so let's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.450 
mix this in a little bit later so let's
set<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:08.270> aside<00:01:08.680> ok<00:01:09.680> first<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.070> want<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.280> take

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
immediately and this should start to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.410 
immediately and this should start to
curdle<00:02:41.190> they<00:02:42.190> should<00:02:42.370> start<00:02:42.610> curdling<00:02:43.090> within

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
choosing to use as you can see this is

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.780 
choosing to use as you can see this is
actually<00:02:55.030> starting<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.600> curl<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.640> what

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
actually starting to curl and what

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.670 
actually starting to curl and what
you'll<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.120> here<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.780> what<00:02:59.050> they<00:02:59.200> call<00:02:59.380> curds

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
you'll have here is what they call curds

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.350 
you'll have here is what they call curds
in<00:02:59.890> way<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:02.410> see<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.740> curds<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
in way you can see the curds and the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.470 
in way you can see the curds and the
liquid<00:03:04.690> left<00:03:04.900> behind<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.830> way<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.330> can

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
liquid left behind is the way as you can

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.860 
liquid left behind is the way as you can
see<00:03:10.660> here<00:03:11.250> 30<00:03:12.250> seconds<00:03:12.640> later<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.510> did

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
see here 30 seconds later this did

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.430 
see here 30 seconds later this did
curdle<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:16.600> have<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.750> separation<00:03:17.260> between

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
curdle and we have a separation between

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.210 
curdle and we have a separation between
the<00:03:18.370> way<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.480> curds<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.110> I'm<00:03:20.800> gonna<00:03:20.950> let

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
the way and the curds and I'm gonna let

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.800 
the way and the curds and I'm gonna let
this<00:03:21.400> sit<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.910> rest<00:03:22.150> off<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.870> heat<00:03:24.210> for<00:03:25.210> 10

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
this sit and rest off the heat for 10

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.930 
this sit and rest off the heat for 10
minutes<00:03:26.760> okay<00:03:27.760> now<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.330> need<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.930> drain<00:03:29.940> your

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
minutes okay now you need to drain your

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.030 
minutes okay now you need to drain your
curds<00:03:31.510> into<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.710> cheesecloth<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.770> can<00:03:35.920> do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
curds into your cheesecloth you can do

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.640 
curds into your cheesecloth you can do
this<00:03:36.190> one-handed

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.030 

okay<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:46.209> we're<00:03:46.450> gonna<00:03:46.540> let<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.780> drain<00:03:47.230> for

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
okay and we're gonna let that drain for

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.170 
okay and we're gonna let that drain for
probably<00:03:48.489> about<00:03:48.670> five<00:03:49.180> minutes<00:03:50.700> okay<00:03:51.700> when

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
probably about five minutes okay when

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.009 
probably about five minutes okay when
the<00:03:52.720> cheese<00:03:53.260> curds<00:03:54.159> have<00:03:54.489> drained<00:03:55.019> really

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
the cheese curds have drained really

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.449 
the cheese curds have drained really
well<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.799> tell<00:03:56.920> there<00:03:57.069> won't<00:03:57.189> be<00:03:57.220> much

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
well you can tell there won't be much

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.240 
well you can tell there won't be much
fluid<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:57.970> bottom<00:03:58.329> of<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.530> colander<00:03:59.920> and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
fluid in the bottom of the colander and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.460 
fluid in the bottom of the colander and
it<00:04:01.060> kind<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.269> holds<00:04:01.420> its<00:04:01.629> shape<00:04:01.689> just<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.230> little

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
it kind of holds its shape just a little

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.080 
it kind of holds its shape just a little
bit<00:04:02.620> there<00:04:02.829> when<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.129> move<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.569> like<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:06.090> it's

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
bit there when you move it like so it's

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.099 
bit there when you move it like so it's
got<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.239> little<00:04:07.359> bit<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.599> a<00:04:07.659> spring<00:04:07.930> back

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
got a little bit of a spring back

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.800 
got a little bit of a spring back
texture<00:04:08.680> then<00:04:09.340> go<00:04:09.640> ahead<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.269> tie<00:04:10.540> this<00:04:10.599> up

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
texture then go ahead and tie this up

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.330 
texture then go ahead and tie this up
okay<00:04:13.810> we're<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:13.989> going<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.379> gather<00:04:14.590> the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
okay we're just going to gather the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
and just squeeze out a little bit of the

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.110 
and just squeeze out a little bit of the
liquids<00:04:25.419> just<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.780> little<00:04:25.960> bit<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.280> see<00:04:27.520> it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.189 

like<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.240> see<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.479> cake<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:31.840> don't<00:04:31.870> squeeze<00:04:32.169> too

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
like I see a cake you don't squeeze too

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.150 
like I see a cake you don't squeeze too
hard<00:04:32.380> you'll<00:04:32.800> push<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.630> curds<00:04:34.630> through<00:04:35.160> take

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
hard you'll push the curds through take

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.689 
hard you'll push the curds through take
a<00:04:36.190> string<00:04:36.699> I<00:04:38.099> always<00:04:39.099> give<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> little<00:04:39.520> bit

a string I always give it a little bit

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.110 
a string I always give it a little bit
of<00:04:39.789> a<00:04:39.849> spin<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.419> then<00:04:40.599> I<00:04:40.690> take<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:41.110> string<00:04:41.590> and

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
of a spin and then I take a string and

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.980 
of a spin and then I take a string and
tie<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.180> like<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:45.300> okay<00:04:46.300> once<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:46.750> has<00:04:46.960> been

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
tie it like so okay once this has been

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.210 
tie it like so okay once this has been
tied<00:04:47.530> I'm<00:04:48.520> now<00:04:48.849> going<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.389> tie<00:04:49.720> this<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:51.190> a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
tied I'm now going to tie this to a

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.870 
tied I'm now going to tie this to a
wooden<00:04:51.699> spoon<00:04:52.110> I'm<00:04:53.110> gonna<00:04:53.289> transfer<00:04:54.010> this<00:04:54.160> to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
wooden spoon I'm gonna transfer this to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.790 
wooden spoon I'm gonna transfer this to
a<00:04:54.910> taller<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:56.159> stockpot<00:04:58.199> make<00:04:59.199> sure<00:04:59.380> your<00:04:59.500> spoon

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
a taller a stockpot make sure your spoon

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.100 
a taller a stockpot make sure your spoon
is<00:04:59.979> wide<00:05:00.250> enough<00:05:00.460> for<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.479> diameter<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:02.020> the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
is wide enough for the diameter of the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.379 
is wide enough for the diameter of the
pot<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.710> can<00:05:03.430> see<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:03.699> is<00:05:03.880> just<00:05:04.120> hanging
