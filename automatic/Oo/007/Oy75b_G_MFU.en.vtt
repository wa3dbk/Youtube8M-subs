1<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.570> 5<00:02:37.900> complete<00:02:38.320> now<00:02:38.530> I've<00:02:38.830> made<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
1 of 5 complete now I've made it to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.980 
1 of 5 complete now I've made it to
about<00:02:39.400> phase<00:02:39.820> three<00:02:40.180> or<00:02:40.300> four<00:02:40.510> gnarly<00:02:40.840> sure

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
about phase three or four gnarly sure

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.530 
about phase three or four gnarly sure
which<00:02:41.260> one<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.740> there's<00:02:42.640> five<00:02:43.030> phases<00:02:43.270> I

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
which one but there's five phases I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.090 
which one but there's five phases I
guess<00:02:43.720> with<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.960> demo<00:02:44.230> version<00:02:44.320> not<00:02:44.890> really

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
guess with the demo version not really

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.440 
guess with the demo version not really
sure<00:02:45.250> about<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.550> paid<00:02:45.700> version<00:02:45.730> since<00:02:46.300> I

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
sure about the paid version since I

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.200 
sure about the paid version since I
don't<00:02:46.600> really<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.340> guys<00:02:48.520> can

change the view very easily with the
accelerometer<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:55.990> gyroscope<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.850> hear<00:02:57.850> of

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
accelerometer and gyroscope and hear of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
also a timer if you guys see right there

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.680 
also a timer if you guys see right there
so<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.650> have<00:03:02.860> two<00:03:03.280> minutes<00:03:03.490> 45<00:03:04.000> seconds<00:03:04.420> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
so you have two minutes 45 seconds and
