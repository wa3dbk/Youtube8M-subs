00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 and are already training for the next 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.889
 round of the São Paulo championship how 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 there is the team and I also wanted to know 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.540
 of you as someone who is 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.970
 there being air from the montijo 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.619
 first good morning to trainings 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.019
 It's still in the beginning, we have to 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 pretending only training day was the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.720
 second match we are and we are 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 training with the third match and team 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.079
 little then in front of people 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.520
 physically that they began to train 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.200
 November 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 So when we start to equalize 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.129
 in which the championship will be good 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.410
 the montijo exit is a player 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.730
 exceptional is not that you do not have to speak 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.620
 He is an ace 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.410
 it's going to be a big big loss pro 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 but there are players who can be 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 by him 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.020
 the boys from the base who are coming from 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.809
 Other players who 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.239
 are there in the cast are of good quality 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 montijo already said goodbye to you and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.420
 another curiosity which the matter today 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.460
 athletes the next round or decision of the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.020
 because many players who 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.150
 came from the base are part of the cast 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 main is the montijo he's still there 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.090
 He's talking to us all the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 Thank you, God, and the subject is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 just the two 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 We're rooting for the boys who 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.439
 they can be champions 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.079
 two-time champion is not showing his 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.600
 his talent that the saints can show 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.060
 also its size in its greatness which 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920
 will be two-time champion and that they can 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.920
 do a good job there that they can 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.500
 rise so that the professional and that good 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 view also and we are also 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.610
 I look at the next match that there is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.100
 eight years 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 We want to get out of there and dictate 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 three points 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.950
 changed the marking system 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.530
 of the American only with a steering wheel you 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.799
 I really was surprised that you played 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.360
 a lesson you in that sharing just played 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.820
 practically alone and had it in his head 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.410
 of area is very changes and system of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.430
 marking imposed by the game is a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.170
 little né that started from landrin 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.230
 his look is actually half 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.590
 I was helping a lot there but the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.719
 philosophy of dax complicated a little ne 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.420
 that he has a philosophy of game that 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.310
 plays the ball a lot and people like me said 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.879
 early in the season when 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.230
 just the same, physically, we 're okay 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.150
 there beating them and see if the game 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.439
 have a little bit a little bit 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.569
 another five minutes more 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.629
 could turn the game that in the end he 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.060
 Feel this, then, for me, what? 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.060
 got me a lot in the game is the physical part 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.150
 I talked about the behavior of the 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.569
 Osvaldo, right? 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 in these first days of work 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.829
 apparently for the paulistas 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.769
 there was a radical change in his style 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.040
 was a man not accustomed tranquilão 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.359
 screaming beatifying field and in the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.849
 last game until it is to be directed to two 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.500
 fans who were running in the 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.500
 ear has done in the trainings that 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.109
 he is overcharging you what 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.329
 the positive aspects of this change and 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.419
 You're also surprised by this 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.629
 Mr. Osvaldo is because already known 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:36.349
 In my view, Ronaldo is a quiet guy. 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.810
 I do not not see that from the supporter 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.299
 He's a guy who charges people but 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.519
 collection is always to improve is 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.799
 an emotive face that you 're looking for 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:51.079
 always the top of the group the group also 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.590
 It's a guy who is victorious the guy who 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.599
 was in the botafogo was champion carioca and 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.919
 left the botafogo on the liberators 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.169
 he is still implementing his 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.479
 here in the saints only philosophy of 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.530
 play and when this game is in place 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.530
 You'll see what's going to happen. 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:12.319
 it may be that the arouca and the cycere are come back 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.400
 It's for this Sunday game against 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.109
 italian 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.229
 I wanted you to talk about da 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.209
 importance of these two players and 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.139
 osvaldo at the beginning of the season he 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:28.469
 has complained a little of lack of 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.259
 of options was not who imagined a cast 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.849
 more filled and stuffed 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.360
 You see this too if you think you need 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.580
 get more players is on the back of 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.830
 arouca and cycere are great return are 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.210
 great players who have done a lot of 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.129
 and that we missed a lot was in the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.379
 beginning of the season that players 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.169
 they hurt and we got the cast 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.389
 a little reduced but thank god 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.279
 everyone is already recovering in my 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.810
 Should I recover from the shoulder? 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.879
 Of course I know if she's coming back. 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.590
 photo looks only who's in there yet 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.460
 recovering is coming back too. 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.599
 when the group is at full disposal 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.430
 Then I think he will not miss it. 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.789
 not because technically this group is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.789
 very good 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.800
 besides the back of the inserted the arouca 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.810
 and alison is recovering like you 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.439
 same remembered that in this scheme with the 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.580
 plant soil 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.639
 he is using the scheme with three 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.469
 attackers so the dispute for vacancy 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.779
 in the middle field but you see the competition 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.219
 for a space in the middle having 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.870
 pimentel was convinced how a 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.189
 player who plays a little more behind the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.349
 line with the example of the 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:37.139
 advanced competition 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.779
 the competition is great, it's not the same as 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.360
 last year are the same players 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.250
 I'll always be working for 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:51.719
 treat mood to play time 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:55.500
 and the team technically physically is 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:57.509
 is still evolving is the osvaldo still 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.879
 is implanting his philosophy as 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.879
 I told you and you'll still fit it there.
