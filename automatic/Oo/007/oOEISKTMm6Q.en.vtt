absolutely love now a lot of people are
wondering<00:01:30.420> what's<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> difference<00:01:31.320> between

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
wondering what's the difference between

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
wondering what's the difference between
this<00:01:31.890> guy<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> guy<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.180> there's<00:01:33.720> not

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this guy and this guy here there's not

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
this guy and this guy here there's not
too<00:01:34.290> many<00:01:34.439> differences<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.310> gonna<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
too many differences so you're gonna be

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
too many differences so you're gonna be
good<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.509> either<00:01:36.720> pair<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.380> there

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
good to go with either pair but there

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.859 
good to go with either pair but there
are<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.310> small<00:01:38.640> differences<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.630> could

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
are some small differences that could

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
are some small differences that could
make<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.290> break<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.619> decision<00:01:41.009> depending<00:01:41.640> on

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
make or break your decision depending on

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.639 
make or break your decision depending on
which<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.390> interested<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.350> one

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
which one you are interested in so one

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
which one you are interested in so one
of<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> main<00:01:43.979> differences<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of the main differences would be the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.060 
of the main differences would be the
cushion<00:01:45.270> these<00:01:45.960> guys<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.590> full-length

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
cushion these guys here use full-length

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280 
cushion these guys here use full-length
micro<00:01:47.430> G<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> entire<00:01:48.060> mid<00:01:48.299> soles<00:01:48.540> micro<00:01:48.899> G<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
micro G the entire mid soles micro G and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
micro G the entire mid soles micro G and
it<00:01:49.799> feels<00:01:50.009> awesome<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> Curry's<00:01:51.420> they

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it feels awesome and in the Curry's they

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
it feels awesome and in the Curry's they
have<00:01:51.990> micro<00:01:52.590> G<00:01:52.740> carrier<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.850> yellow

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
have micro G carrier which is the yellow

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.969 
have micro G carrier which is the yellow
portion<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> charged<00:01:55.380> foam<00:01:55.680> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
portion and then the charged foam is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980 
portion and then the charged foam is
this<00:01:56.250> thin<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.670> white<00:01:56.939> layer<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.750> they

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
this thin little white layer so they

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.389 
this thin little white layer so they
have<00:01:58.170> micro<00:01:58.590> gene<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> they<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> small

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
have micro gene and they have a small

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
have micro gene and they have a small
layer<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> charged<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.360> top<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
layer of charged on top of that now I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
layer of charged on top of that now I
personally<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.090> both<00:02:03.240> feel

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
personally think that they both feel

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.569 
personally think that they both feel
really<00:02:03.869> good<00:02:04.049> however<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> little

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
really good however this one is a little

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
really good however this one is a little
bit<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.570> guess<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> softer<00:02:07.469> side<00:02:07.619> so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
bit more on I guess the softer side so

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.619 
bit more on I guess the softer side so
if<00:02:08.009> you're<00:02:08.160> looking<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.670> something<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
if you're looking for something just a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.900 
if you're looking for something just a
little<00:02:09.660> bit<00:02:09.959> more<00:02:10.190> stable<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.730> is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
little bit more stable then this is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.340 
little bit more stable then this is
definitely<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> better<00:02:12.810> option

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
definitely going to be a better option

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080 
definitely going to be a better option
or<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.590> tractions<00:02:14.100> nearly<00:02:14.460> identical<00:02:14.610> so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
or you tractions nearly identical so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.220 
or you tractions nearly identical so
you're<00:02:15.210> gonna<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.480> good<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.720> go<00:02:15.840> either<00:02:16.080> way

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you're gonna be good to go either way

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.840 
you're gonna be good to go either way
and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.680> I'd<00:02:16.830> say<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.130> major<00:02:17.340> difference

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and then I'd say the major difference

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.940 
and then I'd say the major difference
would<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.330> material<00:02:18.870> these<00:02:19.380> guys<00:02:19.650> feature

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
would be the material these guys feature

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.530 
would be the material these guys feature
clutch<00:02:20.310> fit<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.760> then<00:02:20.910> these<00:02:21.030> guys<00:02:21.240> feature

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
clutch fit and then these guys feature

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.090 
clutch fit and then these guys feature
what<00:02:21.720> they<00:02:21.840> call<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.230> ax<00:02:22.260> foam<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.920> more

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
what they call an ax foam this is more

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.310 
what they call an ax foam this is more
plasticy<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:24.180> does<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.660> slight<00:02:25.050> stretch

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
plasticy it does have a slight stretch

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.890 
plasticy it does have a slight stretch
to<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.680> whereas<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.190> has<00:02:26.370> less<00:02:26.640> stretch<00:02:26.970> but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to it whereas this has less stretch but

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.540 
to it whereas this has less stretch but
it<00:02:27.990> feels<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.410> nicer<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:29.070> foot<00:02:29.340> these

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
it feels a lot nicer on your foot these

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.430 
it feels a lot nicer on your foot these
also<00:02:29.730> fit<00:02:30.090> slightly<00:02:30.600> wider<00:02:30.840> than<00:02:30.990> these<00:02:31.260> guys

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
also fit slightly wider than these guys

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
also fit slightly wider than these guys
as<00:02:31.680> far<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:31.980> volume<00:02:32.220> not<00:02:32.670> width<00:02:33.060> wise<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:33.600> just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
as far as volume not width wise but just

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
as far as volume not width wise but just
the<00:02:34.020> volume<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.680> which<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.400> material<00:02:35.790> kind<00:02:35.910> of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the volume in which the material kind of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.190 
the volume in which the material kind of
wraps<00:02:36.210> around<00:02:36.330> your<00:02:36.510> foot<00:02:36.660> these<00:02:36.870> are<00:02:37.050> pretty

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
wraps around your foot these are pretty

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
wraps around your foot these are pretty
snug<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.800> then<00:02:38.310> these<00:02:38.460> ones<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
snug and then these ones just have a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.820 
snug and then these ones just have a
little<00:02:39.180> bit<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.390> extra<00:02:39.690> space<00:02:39.900> around<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
little bit of extra space around the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.260 
little bit of extra space around the
foot<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.310> obviously<00:02:41.430> these<00:02:41.880> guys<00:02:42.060> have

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
foot and then obviously these guys have

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.540 
foot and then obviously these guys have
much<00:02:42.510> more<00:02:42.690> perforation<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.710> there<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.190> actual

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
much more perforation so there is actual

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.190 
much more perforation so there is actual
ventilation<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.180> these<00:02:45.300> guys<00:02:45.510> no<00:02:45.780> blister

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
ventilation and these guys no blister

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.350 
ventilation and these guys no blister
issues<00:02:46.560> whereas<00:02:47.430> these<00:02:47.580> guys<00:02:47.640> some<00:02:48.090> people

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
issues whereas these guys some people

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.320 
issues whereas these guys some people
have<00:02:48.540> blisters<00:02:48.810> some<00:02:49.230> people<00:02:49.500> don't<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:51.000> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
have blisters some people don't so you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330 
have blisters some people don't so you
know<00:02:51.450> those<00:02:51.750> are<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.230> main<00:02:52.440> differences

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
know those are the main differences

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.190 
know those are the main differences
between<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.180> other<00:02:54.600> than<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.960> they're

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
between the two other than that they're

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.780 
between the two other than that they're
almost<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.710> same<00:02:55.860> exact<00:02:56.220> shoe<00:02:56.400> now<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
almost the same exact shoe now on a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.460 
almost the same exact shoe now on a

know step spare I'm not really short or

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.350 
know step spare I'm not really short or
it<00:04:05.190> could<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.460> been<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.730> sample<00:04:06.150> stage

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360
