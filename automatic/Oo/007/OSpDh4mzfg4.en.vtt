00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
in the future it's pretty smart when I

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.670 
in the future it's pretty smart when I
heard<00:00:55.450> about<00:00:55.540> it<00:00:55.810> as<00:00:55.899> brick<00:00:56.110> taps<00:00:56.320> use<00:00:56.500> time

travel now I don't think so I don't know
maybe<00:00:58.390> they'll<00:00:58.570> explain<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.290> movie

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
maybe they'll explain that in the movie

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.200

you're<00:01:01.510> doing<00:01:01.750> with<00:01:01.899> it<00:01:01.930> but<00:01:02.170> aside<00:01:02.410> from

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
you're doing with it but aside from

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.020 
you're doing with it but aside from
picking<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.010> movie<00:01:03.190> apart<00:01:03.460> that's<00:01:03.670> clearly

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
picking the movie apart that's clearly

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.789
