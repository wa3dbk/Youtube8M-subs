00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
here and as the plant grew I added more

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.040 
here and as the plant grew I added more
soil<00:00:40.560> so<00:00:40.860> hopefully<00:00:41.370> we've<00:00:42.270> got<00:00:42.510> potatoes

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and I believe that you just kind of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470 
and I believe that you just kind of
stick<00:02:30.680> them<00:02:30.860> down<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.190> basement<00:02:31.480> clean

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
stick them down in the basement clean

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.970 
stick them down in the basement clean
them<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.780> little<00:02:32.810> bit<00:02:33.080> but<00:02:33.230> don't<00:02:33.440> wash<00:02:33.709> them

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
them up a little bit but don't wash them

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.240 
them up a little bit but don't wash them
and<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:35.540> kind<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.840> brush<00:02:36.440> off<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.830> dirt<00:02:37.070> and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
and just kind of brush off the dirt and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.940 
and just kind of brush off the dirt and
then<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.060> leave<00:02:38.270> them<00:02:38.480> down<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.290> basement

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
then you leave them down in the basement

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.920 
then you leave them down in the basement
for<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> couple<00:02:40.850> weeks<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.330> then<00:02:41.450> they'll<00:02:41.630> cure

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
for a couple weeks and then they'll cure

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.199 
for a couple weeks and then they'll cure
the<00:02:42.770> big<00:02:42.920> thing<00:02:43.100> with<00:02:43.220> potatoes<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.030> make

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
the big thing with potatoes is to make

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.820 
the big thing with potatoes is to make
sure<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.540> they're<00:02:44.720> not<00:02:44.900> green<00:02:45.350> on<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
sure that they're not green on the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.400 
sure that they're not green on the
inside<00:02:46.450> potatoes<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:47.660> exposed<00:02:48.200> to

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
inside potatoes that are exposed to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.550 
inside potatoes that are exposed to
light<00:02:48.770> will<00:02:49.640> get<00:02:50.270> green<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> inside<00:02:50.959> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
light will get green on the inside and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.860 
light will get green on the inside and
that's<00:02:51.739> some<00:02:52.070> sort<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:53.000> forget<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.780> is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
that's some sort of I forget what it is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.510 
that's some sort of I forget what it is
some<00:02:54.080> sort<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.320> acid<00:02:54.680> or<00:02:54.770> whatever<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.370> is

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
some sort of acid or whatever and it is

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.610 
some sort of acid or whatever and it is
not<00:02:55.730> good<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.090> humans<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.570> eat<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.380> if<00:02:57.500> you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
not good for humans to eat so if you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.430 
not good for humans to eat so if you
find<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.920> green<00:02:58.070> potato<00:02:58.930> just<00:02:59.930> plant<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.290> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
find a green potato just plant it and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.320 
find a green potato just plant it and
grow<00:03:00.860> some<00:03:01.100> potatoes<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.730> aren't<00:03:01.940> green<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
grow some potatoes that aren't green I

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.510 
grow some potatoes that aren't green I
think<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.930> would<00:03:03.050> be<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.140> best<00:03:03.260> option<00:03:03.530> so

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
think that would be the best option so

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.160 
think that would be the best option so
anyway<00:03:04.790> there<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.030> go<00:03:05.180> there<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.600> potatoes

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
