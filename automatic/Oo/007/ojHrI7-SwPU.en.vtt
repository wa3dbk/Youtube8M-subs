00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.150
 the camera 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 with the cable it has the first light 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.560
 for camera in series production 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 We managed to look at this camera 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 just a little closer 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 When you look the light you call yourself 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.250
 Of course not necessarily to one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.540
 digital camera reminds the line 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 is held long 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.439
 a discreet elegance of the housing is 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.949
 definitely not by hand 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 point 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.740
 the housing partly consists of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.600
 aluminum and partly silicone 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.730
 The lens is made with a magnetic 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.950
 cap protected against external influences 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.360
 In the operation you have to go through 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.730
 the changed shape of course something 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.280
 There are only keys to change 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.000
 few on the top is the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.500
 trigger 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.780
 behind it is also the zoom 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.150
 Regulator, however, this was very 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.710
 unusually realized to change 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.320
 The focal length is driven by the finger 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.570
 over the camera housing the 8x zoom 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.130
 covers a small picture equivalent 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.990
 focal length from 43 to 3 144 mm 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.479
 on the bottom was the one 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 In addition, the switch is placed 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.250
 camera here via micro usb with a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.780
 computer connected and charged 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.369
 There are no buttons 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.040
 remaining settings are per 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.080
 made on the backside touchscreen 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.940
 one strokes on the display from below 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.050
 There is an additional display upstairs 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.120
 to the fore 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.730
 Here is the creative mode 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.290
 also changed the 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.640
 available space and the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.640
 show battery status 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.450
 4 from top to bottom weight you get 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.009
 with activated manual settings 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.729
 access to the sensors artificiality 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.729
 and the closing time 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.340
 the iso area can be a third 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.280
 to 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.280
 from iso 80 to iso 3,200 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.500
 to take a picture , one looks for oneself 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.150
 two or more motives are in 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.810
 different distance to the camera 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.090
 are located 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.860
 it works best with the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.990
 creative mode and focused on that 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.310
 second motive or the middle case 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.060
 More than two objects in the picture 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.040
 are located 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.310
 now the other objects should be in the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.380
 picture appear slightly blurry 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.050
 The menu is accessed via the carrie 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.850
 gear in the upper right corner 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.050
 here are among others the manual 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.050
 Settings enabled 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.370
 the recorded images can be with 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.370
 to swipe to the right 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.120
 Here are the recordings, among others 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.120
 also be deleted 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.540
 already in the camera can 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.190
 focus effect be used by the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.720
 low resolution of the display leaves 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 not much on this 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.040
 Recognize the recording mode 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.040
 you get to the left by wiping
