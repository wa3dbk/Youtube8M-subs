00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello to everyone so today we get 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.650
 found for a social tutorial 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.509
 how to make a hypnotic look 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 so in fact it's a tutorial that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.029
 mix of tips but also a review 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.800
 on the products of the anah infinitely 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.119
 you do not know if you know or 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 not this mark 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.150
 and if ever that sheep and well I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.160
 let you look 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769
 it's marty then the first trick 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.590
 for a hypnotic look it's without 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.110
 hesitation the work of his eyebrow 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.079
 so the eyebrow obviously he has to be 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.260
 extremely well shaved if you are not 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.540
 not strong in hair removal I advise you 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 to go to professionals then 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.879
 inevitably in everyday life we â€‹â€‹have the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.910
 eyebrow makeup and to do this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.430
 we come to the mark infinitely you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.070
 so why I really enjoyed 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 this brand at the level of their products 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.180
 for eyebrows it's simply 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 because it's a mascara and I find 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.860
 it's more practical than a pencil 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.590
 because the pencil in general you can 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.170
 to get to a pretty ugly thing and that you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 does a big disgusting bottom at the level 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.670
 eyebrows that there is a mascara that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 actually contains fiber and it's going 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.680
 just simply pigmented and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.310
 redesign your source he make 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.710
 too much 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 then at the color level there is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.130
 four colors I have three so 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.079
 you have the lite you have there 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 cappuccino and chocolate is necessarily 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 so joke the color that I use 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 it's chocolate 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.920
 so I like it a lot because 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 give right away a lot more 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720
 of intensity you will see I'm going to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.810
 show 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.320
 so already mascara it's like those 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 this called louvre game and as you 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 can see there are plenty of 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 little fibers on the brush and what it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.829
 will happen is that I will spend it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.840
 on my eyebrows and little by little it's going 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.080
 come spicy then what I like 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.760
 as well 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.820
 in this mascara is that in addition to 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:08.410
 fibers there is clay and actually doing that 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 will help strengthen your hair and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.160
 So, as you can see 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.920
 well my eyebrow does a lot less 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.530
 scattered but it's still very 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.860
 natural then we can see the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.140
 difference between before and after 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.510
 here it is immediately much more 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.580
 decided and it really gives more 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.530
 character especially after when I them 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.230
 makeup so I necessarily do the same 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.510
 on the other side the second tips 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.990
 inevitably it's going to be becoming master of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.150
 black kohl pencil in the mucous membrane and 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.459
 to finish we go to the third 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.800
 step it is the application of mascara 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.660
 so mascara is the same thing 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.330
 it's a fibrous mascara that goes 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.180
 allow to expand especially to lengthen 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.880
 your eyelashes to the max then at the level of makeup 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.640
 eyelids I put only a makeup 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.980
 clear eyelids I did not want to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.810
 how to say a mascara too much 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.660
 loaded because if you want us to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.330
 can see your eyelashes think necessarily a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.790
 guy with eyeshadow very clear if 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.650
 georges rÃ©mi said black it was dead all 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.290
 immediately as we would really - 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.300
 welcome but if it's the same avoid 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.600
 you make a line of eyeliner too 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.090
 thick because it breaks the line of 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.010
 eyelashes so first I apply their 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.800
 mascara you can very well use 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.050
 your mascara but this mascara actually and 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.360
 provides when you buy mascara 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.950
 fibrous I really like the brush I 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.260
 find that it is really thick 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.700
 I'm going to apply mascara on 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.769
 eyelashes 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.709
 so really think about putting it everywhere 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.989
 the idea is that we're going 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.560
 moisten the eyelash so as to go 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.330
 put the fibers afterwards 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.220
 here is what gives mascara without them 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.250
 fibers and now I'm going to 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.110
 the application of fiber mascara you 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.799
 that in fact I'm going to come and apply the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.650
 fibers on the mascara and actually it takes 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.850
 do it just in time to get it 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.270
 result that we want I replicate the 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.800
 mascara so do not know if we see the 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.360
 camera but already there we see 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.290
 the result he is super pretty years 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.090
 I love then not only it finally goes 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.000
 I find that Sam lengthens the lashes 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.220
 but beyond lying down I find 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.750
 that's it and then if I wanted you 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.120
 show the difference between the two 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.820
 so on that side actually it's the side 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.050
 where I put the mascara plus the fibers 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.690
 and that I put a coat of mascara 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.720
 and that side is where I put the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.670
 mascara alone and here we see very 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.910
 clearly the difference and I am 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.560
 super happy with the result 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.450
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.530
 think and I will inevitably do this 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.150
 year there because there it looks like you 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.180
 there he is asleep this one he in mode 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.130
 hello too well awake the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.740
 tutorial is now over then 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.080
 I can not wait to have all your 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.090
 comments do not hesitate to tell me if 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.700
 did you know the brand 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.770
 infinitely you if it tempts you to 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.660
 test and I would like to know if you 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.600
 find that my eyebrows are too 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.520
 marked or not me I admit that I would have 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.130
 may have been able to pass only one layer 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.980
 but I also like to have eyebrows 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.169
 draw enough what I was doing too 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.390
 before is that I put myself squarely 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.980
 black mascara on the eyebrows so 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.340
 this is really a question of 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.960
 taste for mascara at eye level 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.570
 I have nothing to say I find 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.640
 really well the only little problem where he 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.950
 must be careful is that when 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.500
 apply fiber it can make 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.150
 small deposits on your cheek but that 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.130
 share very easily you take a 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.050
 cotton swab you lightly past it 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.840
 on it actually the fibers go 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.450
 cling on the stalk cotton hairs 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.580
 and there is nothing so there I am 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.620
 really very satisfied with his products 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.350
 I will put you all the links in 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.590
 the info bar the product for them 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.530
 eyebrow costs 35 euros and for the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.100
 mascara the same is 35 euros and there you 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.450
 offers in addition the normal mascara but 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.520
 again if you do not want that 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.180
 use the fiber you can put 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.710
 your own mascara also at the level of 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.450
 mascara me g 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.880
 the black color but you can also 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.430
 take it in colorless ie 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.590
 if you like pigmented your eyebrows in 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.690
 blue or purple i do not know me eh 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.000
 well you use your mascara and on 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.460
 the site you select the color 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.590
 colorless so here I think you have 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.230
 everything says there is no date of 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.600
 expiry since it's fiber from 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.480
 it's pretty practical 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.910
 do not perish here that's it bah I hope in 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.070
 any case that this video will have pleased you 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.770
 and what else do you say I'm good at 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.110
 thank you very much for your follow-up 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.240

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.750
