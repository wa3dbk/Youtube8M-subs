00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
math type documents and code but that's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.610 
math type documents and code but that's
about<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.610> they<00:03:01.940> see<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.840> mind-blowing

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
about it they see is that mind-blowing

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.589 
about it they see is that mind-blowing
that<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.459> was

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
that it was

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.520 
that it was
the<00:03:05.959> peak<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.530> Technology<00:03:07.400> now<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:08.120> seems<00:03:08.989> kind

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the peak of Technology now it seems kind

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.559 
the peak of Technology now it seems kind
of<00:03:09.680> worthless<00:03:09.980> well<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.969> kind<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.329> good

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
of worthless well it's kind of good

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.000 
of worthless well it's kind of good
because<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.200> was<00:03:12.349> kind<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.799> first

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
because it was kind of the first

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.300 
because it was kind of the first
technology<00:03:13.400> my<00:03:14.030> computers<00:03:14.959> today<00:03:15.170> are<00:03:15.379> kind

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
technology my computers today are kind

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.849 
technology my computers today are kind
of<00:03:16.400> better<00:03:17.359> let's<00:03:17.750> do<00:03:18.019> some<00:03:18.260> math<00:03:18.409> go<00:03:18.650> ahead

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
of better let's do some math go ahead

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:28.000 
of better let's do some math go ahead
type<00:03:19.159> in<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.340> math<00:03:19.489> problem<00:03:26.709> when<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.799> just

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
type in a math problem when you just

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.979 
type in a math problem when you just
type<00:03:28.220> numbers<00:03:28.640> out<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:29.209> computer<00:03:29.689> doesn't

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
type numbers out the computer doesn't

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.599

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
know what you want it to do it just sees

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.099 
know what you want it to do it just sees
the<00:03:31.760> numbers<00:03:31.909> you<00:03:32.450> need<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.750> give<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.019> a

the numbers you need to give it a

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.140 
the numbers you need to give it a
command<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.590> let<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.189> know<00:03:34.220> hey<00:03:34.549> I'm<00:03:34.730> about<00:03:34.969> to

give you numbers that doesn't make any

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.679 
give you numbers that doesn't make any
sense<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:40.220> have<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.609> give<00:03:40.970> some<00:03:41.269> sort<00:03:41.540> of

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
sense you have to give some sort of

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.899 
sense you have to give some sort of
command<00:03:42.379> and<00:03:42.680> then<00:03:42.889> type<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.400> what<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:43.760> want

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.289 
in the world so what you need to do is
you<00:03:48.919> have<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.099> type<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.669> word<00:03:49.879> print<00:03:50.599> first<00:03:51.230> oh

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
you have to type the word print first oh
