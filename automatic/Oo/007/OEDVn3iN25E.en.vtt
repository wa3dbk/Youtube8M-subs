we sort of fought with gameplay versus

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
we sort of fought with gameplay versus
what<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.340> felt<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> characters<00:01:15.299> should

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

one<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.150> other<00:01:37.330> characters<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.290> think

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
one of the other characters that I think

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.160 
one of the other characters that I think
I<00:01:39.010> personally<00:01:39.820> struggled<00:01:40.270> with<00:01:40.450> was<00:01:40.690> ruined

I personally struggled with was ruined
who's<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.860> horse<00:01:42.150> horses<00:01:43.150> are<00:01:43.390> really<00:01:43.780> hard

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
who's the horse horses are really hard

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.780 
who's the horse horses are really hard
to<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.260> first<00:01:44.650> of<00:01:44.770> all<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:44.920> hate<00:01:45.250> drawing<00:01:45.520> horses

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
to do first of all I hate drawing horses

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.490 
to do first of all I hate drawing horses
I<00:01:46.180> just<00:01:46.360> think<00:01:46.630> at<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> thing<00:01:47.470> about

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
I just think at it and the thing about

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.230 
I just think at it and the thing about
horses<00:01:47.950> they<00:01:48.220> look<00:01:48.400> kind<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.640> odd<00:01:48.820> from

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
horses they look kind of odd from

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.719 
horses they look kind of odd from
certain<00:01:49.630> angles<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:50.620> we<00:01:50.950> had<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.310> create

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
certain angles and so we had to create

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.580 
certain angles and so we had to create
this<00:01:51.970> horse<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.510> was<00:01:52.630> somehow<00:01:52.870> much<00:01:53.320> cooler

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this horse that was somehow much cooler

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.760 
this horse that was somehow much cooler
than<00:01:53.890> an<00:01:54.010> actual<00:01:54.220> horse

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.209 

we<00:01:57.100> wanted<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.490> make<00:01:57.700> ruin<00:01:58.509> bigger<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.590> more

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
we wanted to make ruin bigger and more

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.279 
we wanted to make ruin bigger and more
powerful<00:02:00.280> than<00:02:00.880> any<00:02:01.179> horse<00:02:01.570> could<00:02:01.840> possibly

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
powerful than any horse could possibly

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.620 
powerful than any horse could possibly
be<00:02:02.590> he<00:02:03.340> had<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.609> look<00:02:03.820> like<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> weapon

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
be he had to look like a weapon

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:16.700 
be he had to look like a weapon
basically<00:02:05.200> something<00:02:06.159> like<00:02:06.969> this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.680 

I<00:02:16.740> think<00:02:17.070> film<00:02:17.370> directors<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.060> influenced

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
I think film directors have influenced

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.670 
I think film directors have influenced
me<00:02:18.900> what<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> love<00:02:20.160> about<00:02:20.190> movies<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
me what I love about movies is the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.570 
me what I love about movies is the
cinematography<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.220> lot<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
cinematography and I think a lot of the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.490 
cinematography and I think a lot of the

more<00:02:28.140> important<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.650> me<00:02:28.680> once<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.670> started

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
more important to me once we started

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.150 
more important to me once we started
working<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> cutscenes

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.190

again because I'm pretty sure there's a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.900 
again because I'm pretty sure there's a
better<00:02:39.120> shot<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.570> could<00:02:39.720> use<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.350> moment

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910
