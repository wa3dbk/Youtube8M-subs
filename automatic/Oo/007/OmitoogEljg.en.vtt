00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
hi guys today I'm going to show you how

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.720 
hi guys today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:07.300> make<00:00:07.660> a<00:00:07.870> simple<00:00:07.980> lock<00:00:08.980> for<00:00:09.309> your<00:00:09.340> doors

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
to make a simple lock for your doors

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.990 
to make a simple lock for your doors
using<00:00:10.210> redstone<00:00:10.540> and<00:00:10.690> some<00:00:11.050> levers<00:00:12.000> it's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
using redstone and some levers it's

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.390 
using redstone and some levers it's
actually<00:00:13.120> a<00:00:13.330> very<00:00:13.510> easy<00:00:13.900> you<00:00:14.230> have<00:00:14.410> to<00:00:14.620> put

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
actually a very easy you have to put

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.120 
actually a very easy you have to put
these<00:00:15.610> on<00:00:15.910> levers<00:00:16.900> in<00:00:16.930> a<00:00:17.260> certain<00:00:17.470> pattern<00:00:17.830> in

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
these on levers in a certain pattern in

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.130 
these on levers in a certain pattern in
order<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.400> open<00:00:18.580> them<00:00:18.880> so<00:00:19.570> this<00:00:19.810> one<00:00:19.990> for

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
order to open them so this one for

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.659 
order to open them so this one for
instance<00:00:20.199> has<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.650> get<00:00:20.769> down<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.339> that<00:00:21.550> one

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
instance has to get down and that one

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.819 
instance has to get down and that one
has<00:00:21.789> to<00:00:21.849> go<00:00:21.999> up<00:00:22.210> and<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.839> door<00:00:22.990> opens<00:00:23.380> as<00:00:23.650> you

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
has to go up and the door opens as you

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.099 
has to go up and the door opens as you
can<00:00:23.980> see<00:00:24.189> we<00:00:24.730> have<00:00:24.849> some<00:00:25.029> gates<00:00:25.329> here<00:00:25.749> we<00:00:25.960> have

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
can see we have some gates here we have

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.710 
can see we have some gates here we have
just<00:00:26.289> plain<00:00:27.159> redstone<00:00:27.789> here<00:00:28.089> connecting<00:00:28.599> to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
just plain redstone here connecting to

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.290 
just plain redstone here connecting to
that<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.230> then<00:00:30.039> oops<00:00:30.310> such<00:00:30.550> an<00:00:30.730> be<00:00:30.909> there<00:00:31.089> and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
that and then oops such an be there and

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.660 
that and then oops such an be there and
this<00:00:31.810> just<00:00:32.079> connects<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.890> door<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.280> opens

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
this just connects to the door and opens

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.420 
this just connects to the door and opens
or<00:00:33.790> closes<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.650> so<00:00:35.650> let's<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:36.070> show<00:00:36.190> you<00:00:36.280> guys

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
or closes it so let's just show you guys

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.960 
or closes it so let's just show you guys
how<00:00:36.490> to<00:00:36.730> build<00:00:37.060> it<00:00:38.460> okay<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:39.520> let's<00:00:39.760> start

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
how to build it okay so let's start

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.700 
how to build it okay so let's start
building<00:00:40.300> this<00:00:40.450> so<00:00:40.900> first<00:00:41.140> of<00:00:41.290> all<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.500> need

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
building this so first of all you need

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.540 
building this so first of all you need
your<00:00:41.860> house<00:00:42.100> as<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.640> can<00:00:42.790> see<00:00:43.060> I<00:00:43.300> have<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.540> ball

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
your house as you can see I have a ball

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.740 
your house as you can see I have a ball
as<00:00:45.550> I'm<00:00:45.760> filming<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.060> in<00:00:46.240> a<00:00:46.330> cave<00:00:46.510> because

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
as I'm filming this in a cave because

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.940 
as I'm filming this in a cave because
the<00:00:47.680> map<00:00:47.980> is<00:00:48.250> just<00:00:48.760> rubbish<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.350> anyway<00:00:50.650> you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
the map is just rubbish but anyway you

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.880 
the map is just rubbish but anyway you
need<00:00:51.070> some<00:00:51.250> levers<00:00:51.580> adorn<00:00:52.030> your<00:00:52.510> house

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
need some levers adorn your house

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.010 
need some levers adorn your house
obviously<00:00:53.890> redstone<00:00:54.400> redstone<00:00:55.120> torches<00:00:55.810> and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
obviously redstone redstone torches and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.350 
obviously redstone redstone torches and
some<00:00:56.380> stone<00:00:56.680> cobblestone<00:00:57.460> dirt<00:00:57.820> whatever<00:00:58.240> you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
some stone cobblestone dirt whatever you

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.000 
some stone cobblestone dirt whatever you
have<00:00:58.510> there<00:00:58.900> it<00:00:58.960> should<00:00:59.080> work<00:00:59.230> fine<00:00:59.560> I<00:00:59.620> guess

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
have there it should work fine I guess

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.520 
have there it should work fine I guess
so<00:01:01.000> first<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.480> all<00:01:01.570> let's<00:01:01.630> just<00:01:01.960> put<00:01:02.200> two

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
so first of all let's just put two

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.920 
so first of all let's just put two
redstone<00:01:02.800> dust<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.180> easier<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.689> see

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
redstone dust so it is easier to see

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.040 
redstone dust so it is easier to see
which<00:01:05.170> connection<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.220> which<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.930> bit

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
which connection is which is just a bit

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.450 
which connection is which is just a bit
easier<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:08.530> like<00:01:08.650> programming<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.340> do

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
easier it's like programming you do

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.550 
easier it's like programming you do
stuff<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> make<00:01:10.120> everything<00:01:10.420> easier<00:01:10.840> then<00:01:11.470> you

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
stuff to make everything easier then you

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.100 
stuff to make everything easier then you
put<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.890> two<00:01:11.920> pieces<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.630> stone<00:01:13.630> or<00:01:13.840> dirt

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
put your two pieces of stone or dirt

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.920 
put your two pieces of stone or dirt
whatever<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:14.500> want<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.270> now<00:01:16.420> we're<00:01:16.600> making

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
whatever you want a so now we're making

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.380 
whatever you want a so now we're making
a<00:01:16.990> gate<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.000> put<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.210> redstone

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
a gate basically so you put a redstone

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.110 
a gate basically so you put a redstone
torch<00:01:19.600> let<00:01:20.470> some<00:01:20.710> dust<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.280> i'll<00:01:21.640> touch<00:01:21.880> i'll

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
torch let some dust and i'll touch i'll

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.700 
torch let some dust and i'll touch i'll
explain<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.450> later<00:01:22.720> when<00:01:22.960> we<00:01:23.080> have<00:01:23.110> once<00:01:23.530> we

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
explain this later when we have once we

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.450 
explain this later when we have once we
have<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.040> second<00:01:25.030> lever<00:01:25.180> up<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.540> running<00:01:25.750> too

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
have the second lever up and running too

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.490 
have the second lever up and running too
then<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.960> put<00:01:28.960> your<00:01:29.050> connection<00:01:29.470> to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
then you just put your connection to

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.750 
then you just put your connection to
your<00:01:29.710> door<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:32.049> would<00:01:32.200> guess<00:01:32.760> you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
your door and as you would guess you

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.730 
your door and as you would guess you
turn<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.210> lever<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.990> door<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.560> door

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
turn the lever on the door the door

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.080 
turn the lever on the door the door
opens<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.580> vice<00:01:37.000> versa<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:39.220> now<00:01:39.400> let's<00:01:39.820> just

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
opens and vice versa so now let's just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.020 
opens and vice versa so now let's just
start<00:01:40.479> making<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.200> second<00:01:41.680> wiring<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.190> i'm

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
start making the second wiring to i'm

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.700 
start making the second wiring to i'm
making<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.600> three<00:01:43.960> high<00:01:44.140> because<00:01:44.320> i<00:01:44.530> don't

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
making this three high because i don't

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.500 
making this three high because i don't
want<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:45.190> signal<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.580> interfere<00:01:46.119> with<00:01:46.330> on

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
want this signal to interfere with on

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.250 
want this signal to interfere with on
this<00:01:46.720> torch<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.880> lon<00:01:49.180> I'll<00:01:49.810> explain<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.229> later

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
this torch the lon I'll explain it later

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.160 
this torch the lon I'll explain it later
once<00:01:50.590> again<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.490> actually<00:01:51.909> pretty<00:01:52.299> obvious

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
once again it's actually pretty obvious

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.390 
once again it's actually pretty obvious
so<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.280> lay<00:01:54.520> your<00:01:54.549> redstone<00:01:55.000> oops<00:01:56.400> here

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
so you just lay your redstone oops here

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.800 
so you just lay your redstone oops here
and<00:01:58.150> put<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.479> there<00:01:59.729> alright<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.570> both

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and put it there alright so so both

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.320 
and put it there alright so so both
levers<00:02:02.140> are<00:02:02.530> in<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.040> off<00:02:03.220> position<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:04.119> you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
levers are in the off position as you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.679 
levers are in the off position as you
can<00:02:04.540> see<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.650> not<00:02:05.860> giving<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.250> signal<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.909> this

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
can see so not giving a signal and this

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.509 
can see so not giving a signal and this
one<00:02:07.900> technically<00:02:08.289> speaking<00:02:08.739> isn't<00:02:09.039> giving<00:02:09.429> a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
one technically speaking isn't giving a

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.670 
one technically speaking isn't giving a
signal<00:02:09.700> either<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:10.959> looks<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:11.410> it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
signal either but it just looks like it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.180 
signal either but it just looks like it
is<00:02:11.800> because<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:12.250> connected<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.090> torch

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
is because it's connected to this torch

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.010 
is because it's connected to this torch
so<00:02:15.190> once<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.700> give<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.880> signal<00:02:16.120> here

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
so once we give a signal here

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.050 
so once we give a signal here
as<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:18.250> can<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:19.230> signal<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.800> stir<00:02:21.100> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
as you can see signal this stir that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.890 
as you can see signal this stir that
signal<00:02:22.450> turns<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.930> torch<00:02:23.230> into<00:02:23.470> no<00:02:23.740> signal

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
signal turns this torch into no signal

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.850 
signal turns this torch into no signal
now<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.110> one<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.320> still<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.710> off

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
now this one is still in the off

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.710 
now this one is still in the off
position<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.670> as<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.090> see<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.540> not

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
position so as you can see it's not

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.930 
position so as you can see it's not
giving<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.170> signal<00:02:29.380> which<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.160> cause<00:02:30.550> this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
giving a signal which will cause this

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.400 
giving a signal which will cause this
torch<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.540> turn<00:02:31.750> on<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.760> I'll<00:02:33.760> also<00:02:34.660> open<00:02:35.290> this

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
torch to turn on and I'll also open this

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.950 
torch to turn on and I'll also open this
door<00:02:35.650> when<00:02:36.370> you're<00:02:36.520> close<00:02:36.760> or<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.540> put

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
door when you're close or when you put

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.810 
door when you're close or when you put
on<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.440> lever<00:02:38.710> in<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.130> position<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
on this lever in the on position the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.780 
on this lever in the on position the
door<00:02:40.060> will<00:02:40.270> close<00:02:40.440> because<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.160> which

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
door will close because this one which

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880 
door will close because this one which
is<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> on<00:02:43.330> position<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.320> still<00:02:44.650> giving

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
is in the on position to is still giving

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.100 
is in the on position to is still giving
a<00:02:45.100> signal<00:02:45.310> which<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.150> turning<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.570> torch<00:02:46.840> off

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
a signal which is turning this torch off

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.400 
a signal which is turning this torch off
and<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.340> lever<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.420> also<00:02:50.020> giving<00:02:50.320> a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
and now this lever is also giving a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.900 
and now this lever is also giving a
signal<00:02:51.360> which<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.690> turning<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.640> torch<00:02:54.640> off

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
signal which is turning that torch off

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.670 
signal which is turning that torch off
which<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.180> closing<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.690> door<00:02:55.990> so<00:02:56.560> if<00:02:56.650> we

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
which is closing the door so if we

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.570 
which is closing the door so if we
interrupt<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.910> signal<00:02:58.120> from<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.480> second

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
interrupt the signal from the second

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.210 
interrupt the signal from the second
lever<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.330> can<00:03:01.480> see<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.630> door<00:03:01.900> will<00:03:02.050> open

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
lever and you can see the door will open

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.340 
lever and you can see the door will open
because<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.550> torch<00:03:03.910> doesn't<00:03:04.750> give<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.110> signal

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
because this torch doesn't give a signal

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.170 
because this torch doesn't give a signal
which<00:03:05.860> turns<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.370> one<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:08.140> we<00:03:09.180> recover

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
which turns this one on so we recover

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.800 
which turns this one on so we recover
the<00:03:10.360> signal<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.820> as<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.940> can<00:03:13.120> see<00:03:13.150> now<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the signal and as you can see now the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.950 
the signal and as you can see now the
door<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.230> closed<00:03:14.680> again<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.970> basically<00:03:16.510> when

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
door is closed again so basically when

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.090 
door is closed again so basically when
when<00:03:17.290> they're<00:03:17.440> both<00:03:17.710> in<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.860> off<00:03:18.070> position

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
when they're both in the off position

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.550 
when they're both in the off position
nothing<00:03:18.970> will<00:03:19.120> happen<00:03:19.150> when<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.320> one's<00:03:20.470> in

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
nothing will happen when that one's in

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.990 
nothing will happen when that one's in
the<00:03:20.650> on<00:03:20.800> position<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.520> one<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.850> off

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
the on position and that one in the off

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.590 
the on position and that one in the off
position<00:03:22.260> magic<00:03:23.260> will<00:03:23.440> start<00:03:23.770> happening<00:03:24.600> as

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
position magic will start happening as

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.230 
position magic will start happening as
you<00:03:25.810> can<00:03:25.959> see<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.410> will<00:03:26.770> only<00:03:27.010> work<00:03:27.550> when<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.120> is

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
you can see it will only work when it is

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.120 
you can see it will only work when it is
like<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.480> as<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.850> can<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.680> now<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:32.890> can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
like that as you can see so now you can

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.370 
like that as you can see so now you can
make<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.550> bit<00:03:33.700> harder<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.959> can<00:03:35.140> make<00:03:35.260> the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
make it a bit harder to you can make the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.060 
make it a bit harder to you can make the
code<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.709> guess<00:03:36.100> they<00:03:36.700> are<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.060> crack<00:03:37.360> by<00:03:37.690> just

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
code I guess they are the crack by just

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.620 
code I guess they are the crack by just
putting<00:03:39.070> some<00:03:39.190> random<00:03:40.980> levers<00:03:41.980> around<00:03:42.630> maybe

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
putting some random levers around maybe

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.500 
putting some random levers around maybe
also<00:03:43.900> putting<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.560> few<00:03:44.770> buttons<00:03:46.530> whoops<00:03:48.510> yeah

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
also putting a few buttons whoops yeah

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.260 
also putting a few buttons whoops yeah
so<00:03:50.170> as<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.350> can<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.709> now<00:03:50.860> it's<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:51.940> pretty

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
so as you can see now it's it's pretty

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.540 
so as you can see now it's it's pretty
complicated<00:03:52.570> only<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.500> only<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.310> will<00:03:54.490> know

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
complicated only and only you will know

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.320 
complicated only and only you will know
how<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.090> works<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:57.610> open<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:57.940> up<00:03:58.090> again

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
how this works I just open it up again

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.560 
how this works I just open it up again
so<00:03:59.140> now<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.320> can<00:03:59.350> also<00:03:59.620> hide<00:04:00.370> this<00:04:00.700> redstone

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
so now I can also hide this redstone

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.560 
so now I can also hide this redstone
wiring<00:04:02.110> which<00:04:02.950> I'll<00:04:03.130> show<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:04.209> next

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
wiring which I'll show you in a next

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.770 
wiring which I'll show you in a next
video<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.610> hope<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.030> enjoyed<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.420> video<00:04:07.630> I

video so I hope you enjoyed this video I
hope<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.200> learn<00:04:08.620> something<00:04:08.650> from<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.400> which

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
hope you learn something from it which
