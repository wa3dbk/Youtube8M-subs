 I represent formed one boxing of the HP mini 110 in the prophylaxis spectators 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.759
 but superstar and already to his stomach that's it 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.730
 black version Lehmann to the Chilton Stickel he can sing Jan Gedenk 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.710
 technical data with an old accounted for 5 50 percent, and therefore on the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.390
 the newest but still the battery life is very nice 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.360
 slowly made his crew small comma 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.550
 a witness Mattes display 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.329
 It's going to be nice to see you this month 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.929
 ddr3 RAM Announcer by far Bischofszell here for nine years 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.929
 is built core and otherwise opportunities 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.190
 The first thing I want to do here is the city administration in front of me through a bit 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.730
 Zoom in on a 2 0-liter and so on and so on what you get here with 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.240
 Make Cape Town 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.070
 because what are the connections and so on I want now but synonymous 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.490
 of course explain 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.660
 but he has already left 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.080
 right away 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.190
 Armani HQ here 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 Weizsacker makes volts so we have 55 overtime hours 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.560
 Bent should do it 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.410
 in case of recurrence that the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.710
 Nayla Hayek have 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.720
 we are and the end not too big nice stable Kabul not necessarily 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.340
 This is more easily converted to Niqab OTC in the form of these as well 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 Shipment not 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.340
 but here it is second cable with the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.340
 thick end the subject Ballack Seggewiß to 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.980
 not as Langs with about 80 cm 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.490
 and here too 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.020
 but she also has one 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.170
 short percent instructions for 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.170
 Belgrade would mean solving phone numbers worldwide 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.250
 Prof 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.390
 then maybe we can continue 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 to the Red 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.550
 of course you can not see them here black is it reflects 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.440
 but they are on the verge of departure here 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.650
 The Taliban fight what we have and will 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.040
 otherwise here 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.530
 he just printed the solution 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.130
 a bottom we have nothing to know «The whole is 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.079
 completely one piece 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.410
 the plastic continues 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.230
 you can easily do it 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.230
 by bringing in such an organ donation celebration inside 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.509
 our squad is completely inner 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.629
 now it's never been seen we've been here but always privy 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.109
 can still cost ten euros 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.150
 Hermann pci-express-slot of possibly for umts-modems 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.060
 there would be the first sim-cards of this possibility still there 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.130
 but we have a missing one here 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.719
 Expressen Supermini Express Card Reader 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.209

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.590
 W-lan Bluetooth of course integrated and had right here under this 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.739
 EM 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.579
 Underneath this cover was as easy as loosening or duplicating the screws 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.539
 that is at the expense 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.519
 but why do we carry on anyway is so with the idea 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.389
 of the device 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.339
 Red just do it now 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.989
 Apply Press Press Press can wait there 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.060
 and you have the underside of the dramaturge a single screw too 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.279
 treat the mother needs sitting in the storm 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.860
 To headphone and microphone are via a USB time 0 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.439
 without electricity issue has the fight back 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.559
 Business Administration is done here in Münster like Georg and Strom user data 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.399
 stolen 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.259
 on the one hand we have Kensington Lock two USB 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:13.439
 and off switch is the micro 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.089
 after a MMC and processors in the St and of course we still have 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.720
 on 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.560
 LAN port can end up the operator ten months 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.480
 should also transfer data fast enough and contaminate it 2 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.479
 good speakers 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.329
 The End 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.199
 Finn dinghy 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.199
 then a matte display as already mentioned they should be dismounted 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.009
 and if they can see it how can the system that I wait for that 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.069
 the new design is very nice of course what I have to do says 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.569
 Madisch 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.519
 You are off the table and is under transaction help 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.240
 then we have one of the core here 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.980
 to lift microphone slightly 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.949
 we can have a clever keyboard how to recognize 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.549
 Percent no bag empty but and the cups and too big a pro for 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.499
 very good 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:12.339
 Per cent Astra is the Ticino with something to run agile is you have it in the top 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.469
 but now it's on 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.699
 afterwards writes about the weather to do 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.859
 - we are in the paint box EFT has and function keys are included 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.260
 Hochtief Rathaus that means you can change 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.569
 Whether the motto of the meadow is over there, the guys were previously without 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.349
 that must press from FM 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.620
 hectic big king's we get too big at the place 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.319
 how nice this is here 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.319
 this flushes up too wide out of Süsterseel 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.360
 and separate mouse buttons 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.620
 the Selbert quotes are quiet and the Wars catch Hamburg already 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.370
