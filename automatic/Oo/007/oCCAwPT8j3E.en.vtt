change<00:05:08.010> everything<00:05:08.250> now<00:05:08.910> whether<00:05:09.150> this<00:05:09.300> is

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
change everything now whether this is

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.390 
change everything now whether this is
just<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:10.020> single<00:05:10.530> player<00:05:10.800> thing<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.220> then<00:05:11.310> you

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
just a single player thing and then you

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.250 
just a single player thing and then you
don't<00:05:11.640> put<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.000> into<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.270> multiplayer<00:05:12.750> but<00:05:13.020> I

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
don't put it into the multiplayer but I

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.380 
don't put it into the multiplayer but I
think<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.220> could<00:05:14.490> see<00:05:14.670> this<00:05:14.790> in<00:05:14.940> multiplier<00:05:15.360> for

think I could see this in multiplier for

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.350 
think I could see this in multiplier for
short<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.130> he<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.280> something<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.090> like

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360

or with some kind of nation start off
with<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.860> then<00:06:08.220> he's<00:06:08.340> basically<00:06:08.640> gonna<00:06:08.790> stab

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
with and then he's basically gonna stab

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.790 
with and then he's basically gonna stab
them<00:06:09.360> in<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.510> back<00:06:09.600> and<00:06:10.110> work<00:06:10.290> against<00:06:10.710> them

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
them in the back and work against them

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.830 
them in the back and work against them
because<00:06:10.920> he's<00:06:11.160> had<00:06:11.310> a<00:06:11.370> better<00:06:12.030> offer<00:06:12.360> more

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
because he's had a better offer more

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.590 
because he's had a better offer more
money<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.320> so<00:06:14.010> his<00:06:14.490> company<00:06:15.030> would<00:06:15.150> then<00:06:15.330> try

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
money and so his company would then try

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.110 
money and so his company would then try
and<00:06:15.840> destroy<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.920> US<00:06:17.220> or<00:06:17.460> something<00:06:17.850> that<00:06:18.000> is

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
and destroy the US or something that is

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.400 
and destroy the US or something that is
how<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.300> think<00:06:18.600> the<00:06:18.660> store<00:06:18.870> line<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.140> going<00:06:19.320> to

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
how I think the store line is going to

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.780 
how I think the store line is going to
go<00:06:19.530> but<00:06:19.740> put<00:06:19.950> your<00:06:20.070> thoughts<00:06:20.250> in<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.490> comment
