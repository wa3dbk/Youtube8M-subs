swatch them side by side later and see
how<00:01:41.880> similar<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.680> but<00:01:43.680> still

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
how similar they are but still

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.530

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420 
regardless I think this is a little more
like<00:01:45.750> cream<00:01:46.290> colored<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.130> makes<00:01:47.340> sense

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
like cream colored if that makes sense

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
and i swatched it on top of the OPI

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.340 
and i swatched it on top of the OPI
red<00:04:26.310> or<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.520> coca-cola<00:04:27.060> red<00:04:27.420> color<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.080> it

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
red or the coca-cola red color and it

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.540 
red or the coca-cola red color and it
looked<00:04:28.530> really<00:04:28.680> good<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:28.920> top<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.340> so
