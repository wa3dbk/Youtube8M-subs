00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.259
 beautiful actions here ghost cases and today they are 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 here on tiger power again fund is 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.820
 been previously with the video of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 bie steen 1.8 seconds instead today vi 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.860
 I come to bring a replay on modern 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 warfare 3 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.439
 let's join together in 114 seconds and of course 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 it is a good gameplay as you can see 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.779
 even for a double this one the second one 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.880
 that I take during this game 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 we say yes it is a bomber play but 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
 obviously I'm not going to tell him it's a super 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 gameplay since there are thousands of them 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 much faster and there are a lot of people 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.469
 stronger than me who can't make it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.820
 even faster than this with weapons 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.219
 much weaker 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 however let's say it looks like a good gameplay in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.539
 all the cases I wanted to thank before 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 all pauner the dark for giving me 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.350
 the opportunity again to be here with 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 you over italy over power with this one 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.750
 mob 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 I'm really happy to still be 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 here in this brief comment of why 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 the gameplay and braverman you are imagine 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 as already mentioned before and I wanted to give you from 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 advice we say is not that there is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.780
 manual for tirana but fast though 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.939
 some advice that can be given because 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.799
 you have to have more than anything else that ass 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.090
 is the main factor according to factor 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.430
 is to use a weapon that is run 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 someone as you have seen is to use 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 a weapon that is well known to a weapon 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.030
 as strong as cr can be as it can 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.900
 be a 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.430
 submachine gun you will really make 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 massacres will give us the no scoop with aim 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.720
 stable of course I'm obviously 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 coming going to say who with other weapons 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.530
 you can't make these new fast ones 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 because you can very well 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's not talk about spam as it is 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.720
 call in the end shoot at the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.680
 wall excluded what can be done 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 fine with other weapons 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.490
 prejudiced to use such a weapon 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.509
 and play it for example in maps 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.220
 dome terminal 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.050
 within the spa one like this 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.340
 In case you find me really close 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.080
 you will make massacres and if no one else 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.660
 invades your companions are good not 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.000
 make them run away and be up 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.950
 ends in the sport of ha then you will do 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 truly massacres 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 obviously you need to have a good one too 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.720
 team because otherwise he can speak for himself 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.910
 do obviously but quite well though 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.590
 nothing now or personam or as you have seen 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.820
 nothing concluded gameplay tell you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.880
 only if you want to pass mine 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.039
 channel find the link in description 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.500
 I carry various types of mobs 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.480
 the gameplay on black ops two tips e 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.690
 strategies and funny videos about how many 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.489
 votes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.080
 if you want past and see you there or there 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.790
