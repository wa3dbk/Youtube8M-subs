frying an egg absolutely no oil I have

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:49.580 
frying an egg absolutely no oil I have
the<00:00:39.620> burner<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:42.300> medium<00:00:44.120> low<00:00:45.120> heat<00:00:48.379> let<00:00:49.379> these

show<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.089> results

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 

the<00:01:03.839> reason<00:01:04.170> why<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> wanted<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> demonstrate

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the reason why I wanted to demonstrate

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.020 
the reason why I wanted to demonstrate
this<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:09.439> if<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this was because if you really are in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.810 
this was because if you really are in
the<00:01:12.119> cooking<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.920> want<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.009> pan<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.820> easy

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the cooking and want a pan that is easy

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.260 
the cooking and want a pan that is easy
to<00:01:18.000> clean<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:19.399> without<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.670> use<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:22.850> any<00:01:23.850> oil

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
to clean up without the use of any oil

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.529 
to clean up without the use of any oil
that<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.200> ceramic<00:01:28.200> nonstick<00:01:28.710> pan

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
that I think this ceramic nonstick pan

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.359 
that I think this ceramic nonstick pan
is<00:01:30.539> great<00:01:30.990> another<00:01:31.439> nice<00:01:31.649> feature<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is great another nice feature about it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.169 
is great another nice feature about it
is<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> aluminum<00:01:36.560> handle

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
is because you get the aluminum handle

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.260 
is because you get the aluminum handle
it's<00:01:39.179> not<00:01:39.420> hot

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
it's not hot

00:01:41.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's not hot
