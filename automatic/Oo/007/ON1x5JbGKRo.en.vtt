sort of a frosted soft touch sort of
feeling<00:03:31.430> material<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.090> which<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.450> pretty

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
feeling material here which is pretty

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.330 
feeling material here which is pretty
cool<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.690> good-looking<00:03:35.870> case

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
cool and I it's a good-looking case

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.410 
cool and I it's a good-looking case
affordable<00:03:37.340> we<00:03:37.670> had<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> couple<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.180> screen

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
affordable we had a couple of screen

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.170 
affordable we had a couple of screen
shields<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.900> included<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:40.090> cleaning<00:03:41.090> cloth

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
shields and it included a cleaning cloth

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.040 
shields and it included a cleaning cloth
which<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.660> always<00:03:41.810> good

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
which is always good

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.680 
which is always good
and<00:03:43.700> there's<00:03:44.700> not<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:45.000> much<00:03:45.180> more<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.540> say

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and there's not really much more to say

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
and there's not really much more to say
about<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.990> case<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.500> really<00:03:46.830> do<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:48.710> so

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
about this case I really do like this so

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.310 
about this case I really do like this so
I<00:03:49.740> guess<00:03:50.160> that's<00:03:50.310> about<00:03:50.460> it<00:03:50.610> with<00:03:50.820> this<00:03:50.940> one

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
I guess that's about it with this one

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.360 
I guess that's about it with this one
again<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.560> pick<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.770> up<00:03:52.920> for<00:03:53.100> twenty

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
again you can pick this up for twenty

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.800 
again you can pick this up for twenty
two<00:03:53.490> dollars<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.970> ninety-nine<00:03:54.180> cents<00:03:54.600> from
