okay so we're here at the Saturn this is
the<00:00:03.750> Saturn<00:00:04.170> update<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:06.560> turns<00:00:07.560> out<00:00:07.770> it

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
the Saturn update and turns out it

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.089 
the Saturn update and turns out it
wasn't<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.220> coil<00:00:08.460> pack<00:00:09.019> because<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.559> put<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> new

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
wasn't a coil pack because I put a new

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:11.690 
wasn't a coil pack because I put a new
one<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.250> there

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
one on there

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.220 
one on there
well<00:00:11.849> salvage<00:00:12.360> yard<00:00:12.650> that<00:00:13.650> tested<00:00:14.099> good<00:00:15.230> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
well salvage yard that tested good and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.660 
well salvage yard that tested good and
it<00:00:16.320> made<00:00:16.440> no<00:00:16.590> change<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.010> still<00:00:17.250> wasn't<00:00:17.369> firing

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it made no change I still wasn't firing

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.580 
it made no change I still wasn't firing
on<00:00:17.880> two<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.180> three<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> pulled<00:00:21.180> off<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
on two and three so I pulled off the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
on two and three so I pulled off the
ignition<00:00:22.590> module<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> took<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.300> down<00:00:24.330> had<00:00:25.140> it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
ignition module and took it down had it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.730 
ignition module and took it down had it
tested<00:00:25.500> no<00:00:26.220> good<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:30.560> we<00:00:31.560> got

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
tested no good so we got one here we got

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.729 
tested no good so we got one here we got
one<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.079> I'm<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> switch<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> out

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
one here and I'm going to switch it out

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.209 
one here and I'm going to switch it out
real<00:00:35.040> quick<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:36.770> see<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> does<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
real quick and see if that does the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:01:34.280 
real quick and see if that does the
trick<00:00:38.480> hopefully<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> does

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.800 

and<00:01:35.290> we've<00:01:35.560> got<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.860> whole<00:01:35.979> setup<00:01:36.280> here<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
and we've got the whole setup here to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.490 
and we've got the whole setup here to
coil<00:01:38.080> packs<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.130> ignition<00:01:39.369> module<00:01:40.500> okay

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
coil packs and the ignition module okay

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.219 
coil packs and the ignition module okay
that<00:01:42.009> was<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.130> quick<00:01:42.340> switch<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.020> coil

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
that was a quick switch got the coil

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.760 
that was a quick switch got the coil
packs<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.890> new<00:01:45.960> ignition<00:01:46.960> module<00:01:47.380> there's

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
packs on the new ignition module there's

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.580 
packs on the new ignition module there's
the<00:01:47.979> old<00:01:48.130> one<00:01:48.810> we'll<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.080> thing<00:01:50.140> slapped

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the old one we'll get this thing slapped

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.540 
the old one we'll get this thing slapped
on<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.950> see<00:01:51.040> what<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:51.250> does

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
on and see what it does

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.960 
on and see what it does
a<00:01:58.979> disadvantages<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.130> not<00:02:00.280> having<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.729> real

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
a disadvantages to not having a real

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.620 
a disadvantages to not having a real
camera<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.800> real<00:02:02.800> video<00:02:03.160> camera<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.509> it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
camera a real video camera is that it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.160 
camera a real video camera is that it
falls<00:02:07.840> down<00:02:08.020> sometimes<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.989> most

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
falls down sometimes and the most

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.289 
falls down sometimes and the most
opportune<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.890> times<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:13.989> annoying

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
opportune of times it's really annoying

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:24.150 
opportune of times it's really annoying
but<00:02:16.299> it's<00:02:16.450> all<00:02:16.570> good

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:50.970 

baby<00:02:28.050> hold<00:02:49.260> okay<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.320> we<00:02:50.620> got<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.860> ignition

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
baby hold okay so we got the ignition

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.040 
baby hold okay so we got the ignition
module<00:02:51.580> led<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:53.530> all<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.800> coil<00:02:54.100> packs<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.400
