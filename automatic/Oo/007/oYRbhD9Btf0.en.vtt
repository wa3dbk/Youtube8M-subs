00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.210 
down there and right at the top is
covered<00:02:49.680> also<00:02:50.330> now<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.660> notice<00:02:51.900> that

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
covered also now you will notice that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
covered also now you will notice that
these<00:02:53.220> corners<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.750> not<00:02:56.810> covered<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.260> skin

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
these corners are not covered with skin

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.380 
these corners are not covered with skin
that<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.820> because<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.480> right<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:02.270> cut<00:03:03.270> it

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that is because is right here I cut it

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.110 
that is because is right here I cut it
off<00:03:03.570> because<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.500> cannot<00:03:04.890> install<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.970> properly

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
off because I cannot install it properly

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.770 
off because I cannot install it properly
so<00:03:06.980> when<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.160> install<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> skin<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.270> have<00:03:09.510> to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
so when you install a skin you have to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.660 
so when you install a skin you have to
take<00:03:10.020> your<00:03:10.200> time<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.830> installing<00:03:11.459> these

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
take your time in installing these

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.080 
take your time in installing these
corners<00:03:12.330> because<00:03:13.550> it's<00:03:14.550> going<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.850> take<00:03:15.060> a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
corners because it's going to take a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.490 
corners because it's going to take a
while<00:03:15.209> for<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:17.720> install<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:21.320> also<00:03:22.320> it

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
while for you to install that also it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.740 
while for you to install that also it
has<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> self-healing<00:03:23.519> technology<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.630> they

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
has a self-healing technology that they

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.229 
has a self-healing technology that they
implement<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.620> when<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.280> scratch<00:03:26.640> when<00:03:27.030> you

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
implement so when you scratch when you

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.390 
implement so when you scratch when you
have<00:03:27.840> here<00:03:28.200> lines<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.620> scratches<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.190> there

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
have here lines of scratches in there

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.170 
have here lines of scratches in there
after<00:03:30.150> 24<00:03:30.630> hours<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.170> will<00:03:31.470> disappear

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
after 24 hours it will disappear

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.400 
after 24 hours it will disappear
