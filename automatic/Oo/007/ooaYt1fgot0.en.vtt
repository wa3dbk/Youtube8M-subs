00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.150
 a greeting guardians welcome another 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.469
 once to the universe channel of sting and 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.830
 Well, the banner of 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.770
 iron again yesterday he sent me a joke 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.480
 I said smell room came to me commenting that 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.750
 was going to bring quite juicy news 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:30.520
 so let's see what you bring me 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.520
 hi tito what's up 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.940
 good as always he 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.710
 we have contracts worth 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.040
 and good what the team does not matter 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:53.000
 worth as it was to foresee armor of light 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.090
 33 for at level 31, it's good for what you 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.559
 like the mambo there is not much to see 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.120
 because they are the same armors of 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.650
 always of the iron standard but 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.050
 went up to 33 and then the armament 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.570
 that I see it more interesting we have the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.910
 sniper rifle spear of fride 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.080
 afridi 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:18.400
 as you say 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.400
 which looks very good with sun damage 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.970
 and the characteristics are the casualties of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.890
 precision with this weapon makes the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.050
 whites explode like all the rifles of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.100
 sniper and more ammunition for weapons 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.100
 and then an automatic rifle 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.539
 the wrath of that missile and sea 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.909
 with a brutal but brutal cadence 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.640
 minimal impact spit bullet like a yes 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.440
 that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.120
 and good the last half charged 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.120
 causes in editions also have higher 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.890
 greater stability 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.740
 I do not see the truth not interesting 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.210
 then we have the usual ones 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.650
 whenever this I have it I have it 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.540
 and the pod and the temper that is the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.090
 enhancer 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.250
 to win 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.190
 to gain more experience I for my 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 part because I'm not going to play banner 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.769
 iron because it's not worth it 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.239
 that yes it is worth it is very good for 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.420
 those who want to get the team the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.030
 standard but good I see that it is another 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.610
 option to get the only thing that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.230
 they have to serve at level 3 but let's go 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.519
 that you have avant-garde teachings 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.140
 I walk a little stiff 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.459
 the truth but good that I do not have either 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.129
 over here for now my main goal 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.530
 is to get the root armor already 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.750
 it has no more no more history 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.549
 so good for what you want to give 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.799
 to the competitive one because you have a 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.519
 incentive but I for one think 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.470
 it does not bring anything that brings me the truth 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.959
 so good guardians I hope you 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.310
 you find useful here is the if that 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.040
 issued to say that if it will contribute 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.849
 less contributed so greetings and we 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.849
 we see at the border
