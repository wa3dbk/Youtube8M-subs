00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
because you know all these galaxies

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.990 
because you know all these galaxies
there<00:05:46.750> must<00:05:46.930> be<00:05:47.050> something<00:05:47.410> else<00:05:47.530> somewhere

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
there must be something else somewhere

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.640 
there must be something else somewhere
you<00:05:49.000> know<00:05:49.090> maybe<00:05:49.270> bazillions<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.170> miles<00:05:50.380> away

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
you know maybe bazillions a miles away

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.040 
you know maybe bazillions a miles away
from<00:05:50.710> us<00:05:51.040> but<00:05:51.310> gotta<00:05:52.000> be<00:05:52.150> something<00:05:52.540> somewhere

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
from us but gotta be something somewhere

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.560 
from us but gotta be something somewhere
you<00:05:53.830> know<00:05:53.950> there's<00:05:54.220> us<00:05:54.490> so<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:54.940> mean<00:05:55.300> if<00:05:55.390> there's

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
you know there's us so I mean if there's

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.640 
you know there's us so I mean if there's
us<00:05:55.720> there's<00:05:55.750> got<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.170> be<00:05:56.200> something<00:05:56.410> else

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
us there's got to be something else

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.640 
us there's got to be something else
think<00:05:57.070> about<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:57.340> that<00:05:57.460> way
