 description 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.960
 hello gangsters with you panda jakiro 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 against leshrak 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 ends in and intellectuals in our 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.400
 whether the battle of heroes midone at all 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.080
 Soon heroes will be shuffled from Dodgers 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 strongmen and intellect will fight each 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.180
 against each other the rollers are just kids and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.219
 mortal well and today we are looking at 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.360
 fight of support against support as a matter of fact 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.130
 should say that of course jakiro 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.309
 has a big push potential due to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.149
 his terrible skill called 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.280
 joker with a little joker 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.110
 it looks like and generally a big minus jakiro 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 in my opinion from his slowness that is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.530
 he is such a dragon I am slowly 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.879
 fly up then slowly give my camp to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.550
 In general, this is not very cool in fact 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 Actually , as you will see if jakiro 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.719
 hits then little is shown with 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 the other side of the camp of leshrak is also not 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.390
 has the ability to be thrown to them immediately then 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 there is also some slowdown there 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 like my spikes slowly crawl out from under 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 land that's why it turns out funny 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 have hit the camp perfectly did not hit 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.350
 camp well, well, naturally someone more often 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.049
 gets he kills more then more 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.720
 kills that batch wins like this 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.340
 born a pun right off the battles actually 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.490
 approximately equal with does not think that of course 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
 much more fun just pushing the sensor out 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.689
 the appearance of ulta 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 if you leshrak a lot of mana then it's just 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.840
 very very painful but whether you are in medon 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.590
 know much much much then and not on 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.729
 farm much much and not nafarmit 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 the joker has a great third skill 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.159
 which is generally free and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.820
 accordingly you can spit it 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.649
 almost as long as the guys did 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 so 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.880
 battles are about equal difficult 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 say who dominates here looking for the day 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.689
 the same four fights won by jakiro three 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 only crayfish won the fight 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.920
 that is, fifti-fifti in the comments 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.200
 can write whether you played this day 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.729
 if you played for whom and who you 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.649
 seemed more interesting and strong 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.879
 You can play with us in public which 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.580
 called the battle of heroes I don't be 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.260

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.800
