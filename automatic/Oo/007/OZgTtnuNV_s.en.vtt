00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.170
 video that in a prolonged explanation 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.639
 can contribute to weight loss 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 body was formulated for the first 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.199
 time by the author horas fletcher che 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.119
 today he is remembered as the great 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.310
 chewer this author happened 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.740
 even to chew up to 100 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 sometimes every bite before the crew 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.489
 say it because obviously this exists 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.380
 correlation try to explain why 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.630
 this correlation exists between the number 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.790
 of masticatory acts and maintenance 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 even body weight loss 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.030
 of body weight 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.199
 then of substance 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.140
 we have an intestinal level 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.120
 series of passages that are functional 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.360
 basically digestion when the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.570
 food bolus already processed arrives at 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.269
 intestine level having passed 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.370
 through the chewing act then the 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.809
 mechanical digestion in chemical part 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.149
 of the stomach 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.180
 here it is issued by 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.360
 cholecystokinin whose function is 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 substantially to stimulate 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.789
 release of the property and on the one hand e 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.649
 of the digestive intimates that come 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.560
 feel this pancreatic level 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.390
 on the other because the bulk of the managements 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.580
 chemistry comes precisely from the first section 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.619
 of the intestine that is to say in the government 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.140
 therefore the cholecystokinin would have 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 primarily a local action e 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.440
 functional at the time of digestion 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.630
 but also an action let's say a little more 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.390
 to courage and the sense that comes 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.479
 then conveyed through the system 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.700
 nervous system in the brain stem 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:54.820
 that here communicates the sense of falsehood 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.380
 on the other hand when the stomach is full 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.180
 because we ate 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 dini di pisa here 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.340
 the synthesis is the release of ghrelin 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.270
 we know the cretin as the hormone 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.810
 of hunger actually comes 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.550
 produced at the level of specific cells 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.380
 specialty of the gastric fundus 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.050
 so when the stomach the vote there 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.940
 ghrelin is constantly released into 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.510
 circle to communicate precisely the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.000
 need to take a meal 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.520
 when then specific receptors of 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.530
 stretching are prompted by the fact 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.080
 that the stomach is filled with what 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.790
 we ate the summary of the release 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.370
 of the attacked is instead invited 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.560
 therefore substance had to reason in 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.620
 these themes are at the level of 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.770
 wind style receptors stomach that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.380
 if stimulated they promote release 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.420
 of the cholecystokinin that gives us a 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.970
 sense of satiety that inhibit the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.060
 release of ghrelin 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.030
 it would make us feel hungry because everything 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.340
 this quite complex mechanism 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.950
 you come into the game but you need some 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.470
 time that the specialists have 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.530
 quantified in 20 minutes then 20 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.290
 minutes from the moment we have 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.480
 sent the first bite down then the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.870
 reflection that is done is the following if 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.780
 we have a rhythm of chewing wind 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.240
 if we have the habit of chewing a 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.040
 along the amount of food we have the 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.800
 ability to recruit over the 20 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.160
 minutes is certainly smaller respect 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.650
 to that instead we can do with times 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.290
 much faster then chew 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.180
 let's say this first assumption e 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.690
 the other consideration to ensure that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.820
 part of the digestion takes place at the level 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.040
 of the few minutes in Italy from the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.380
 explanation also serves to render more 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.570
 easy the digestive process and therefore ad 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.150
 feel less that sense of unease and 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.790
 of swelling that we say in some cases 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.760
 compare one in the prandial phase 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.340
 specific to the level of saliva we say 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.470
 many say the mechanical action precisely 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.320
 of the chewing ie this enzyme 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.390
 that the Milan went up on wheels 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.440
 contributes to the digestion of starches 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.989
 contained in the meal in the last it must be said 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.419
 that if we have a chew 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.120
 hasty from that food particles 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.500
 they will be coarse 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.710
 before holding that morsel together 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.419
 also a large amount of air that 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.120
 therefore it will contribute to the sense of swelling 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.490
 post prandiale so we say ed 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.199
 usefulness of chewing obviously the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.240
 advice can not be to 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.270
 chew a hundred times as I suggested 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.860
 the author would be impossible but maybe 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.930
 one should strive to do so for 20 or 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.600
 30 times obviously not being a 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.970
 habit we must initially force ourselves 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.620
 a bit of advice could be 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.620
 that of putting the cutlery between one 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.690
 bite and the other until then this act 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.160
 of prolonged chewing become 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.350
 a habit then something that 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.350
 we normally do spontaneously
