has changed with the Hayabusa since it
was<00:00:25.680> launched<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.220> 1999<00:00:26.910> had<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
what really has changed though is our

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970 
what really has changed though is our
perception<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> Malibu<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.440> used<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> be

the ultimate sports bike really is now

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
the ultimate sports bike really is now
considered<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> sports<00:00:51.059> tourer

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
considered to be more a sports tourer

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.770

than an all-out sporty now one thing
you'll<00:00:54.899> notice<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> Hayabusa<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you'll notice with the Hayabusa is that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
you'll notice with the Hayabusa is that
it<00:00:56.610> looks<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.910> no<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.660> motorcycle<00:00:58.289> out

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it looks like no other motorcycle out

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
it looks like no other motorcycle out
there<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.280> hull<00:00:59.520> bike<00:00:59.789> has<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.120> designed<00:01:00.570> in

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
there the hull bike has been designed in

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
there the hull bike has been designed in
a<00:01:00.780> wind<00:01:00.960> tunnel<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.219> slippery<00:01:02.699> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
a wind tunnel to make it as slippery as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
a wind tunnel to make it as slippery as
possible<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> help<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.719> achieve<00:01:03.809> those

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
possible to help it achieve those

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.140 
possible to help it achieve those
massively<00:01:05.369> high<00:01:05.610> speeds

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
massively high speeds

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
massively high speeds
now<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> bulbous<00:01:07.560> nose<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> front<00:01:08.280> isn't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
now the bulbous nose at the front isn't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
now the bulbous nose at the front isn't
just<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.180> looks<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.500> force

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
just there for looks it's there to force

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
just there for looks it's there to force
the<00:01:11.040> air<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> two<00:01:11.760> big<00:01:12.000> holes<00:01:12.180> either

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the air into the two big holes either

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.690 
the air into the two big holes either
side<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:13.350> creates<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.860> ram<00:01:14.100> air<00:01:14.130> effect

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
side which creates a ram air effect

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
side which creates a ram air effect
which<00:01:14.939> produces<00:01:15.450> massive<00:01:15.960> amounts<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
which produces massive amounts of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
which produces massive amounts of
horsepower<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.280> faster<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:20.100> board

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
horsepower the faster you go on board

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
horsepower the faster you go on board
and<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> Hayabusa<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:22.080> has<00:01:22.229> quite<00:01:22.470> an

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and the Hayabusa really has quite an

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
and the Hayabusa really has quite an
unusual<00:01:22.740> riding<00:01:23.400> position<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.450> seat<00:01:24.689> height

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
unusual riding position the seat height

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
unusual riding position the seat height
is<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:25.320> low<00:01:25.530> whereas<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> pegs<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.549> quite

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is quite low whereas the pegs are quite

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
is quite low whereas the pegs are quite
high<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.360> bike<00:01:27.570> does<00:01:27.900> go<00:01:28.080> around

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
high because this bike does go around

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
high because this bike does go around
corners<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.340> fast<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.820> straight

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
corners it's not just fast in a straight

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
corners it's not just fast in a straight
line<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:30.990> you've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.350> huge<00:01:31.650> tank

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
line but then you've got this huge tank

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
line but then you've got this huge tank
in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> middle<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.640> quite<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> long<00:01:33.329> stretch

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
in the middle and quite a long stretch

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
in the middle and quite a long stretch
to<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> bars<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.470> front<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> bit

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
to the bars up front so it is a bit

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
to the bars up front so it is a bit
peculiar<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.630> once<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.079> used<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
peculiar but once you get used to it

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.410 
peculiar but once you get used to it
it's<00:01:37.829> great<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.549> also<00:01:38.850> good<00:01:39.210> for

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it's great and it's also good for

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.969 
it's great and it's also good for
getting<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> wind<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> speeds

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
getting out of the wind when the speeds

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.080 
getting out of the wind when the speeds
do<00:01:41.280> creep<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.700> there

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.000 

the<00:01:48.090> dash<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.510> great<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> great<00:01:49.830> big

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
the dash is great it's got a great big
