00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.630
 hereby focuses with its new 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.580
 flagship the essent p6 clearer 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.710
 lower than the other top models on the 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.320
 market the device as the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.660
 samsung galaxy s5 sony xperia z2 htc one 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.369
 m8 and lg g3 they are just a lot more expensive 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.800
 and even better specifications 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.539
 with that comes the hook now were his p7 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.789
 more the water of, for example, 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.589
 samsung galaxy s4 from last year 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.349
 always a good device but of course 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.090
 a bit older and therefore normal 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.520
 and cheaper in terms of specifications 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.980
 less and that is exactly actually 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600
 opposite those hours we are out and this video 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.870
 I will see which of the two you 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.309
 can buy better if we start with the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.660
 specifications then it stands out that he does not 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.000
 there are so many differences 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.050
 a 13 megapixel camera in my 5 inch 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.640
 full hd screen 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.140
 we have 2 gigabytes of ram with us 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.760
 fast quad-core processor 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.129
 the nuclei in process and differences in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.140
 anything but that's it want 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.999
 actually with the biggest difference 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.350
 maybe the specification card is the 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.749
 camera that is here in front of the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.610
 your requirements for an 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.930
 while the samsung has to do with 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.290
 a 2 megapixel camera 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.119
 but otherwise the traffic jams are small 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.960
 we hire that its design is already a 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.850
 a lot better 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 at have 5 inch screen after samsung one 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.790
 piece of small bottle can see them 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.290
 advantage of samsung 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.659
 but is sometimes reasonable plastic 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.549
 test I wanted you prepared and design has 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.350
 that made of glass and aluminum though 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.570
 that feels very high-quality looks very 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.119
 good from the together and you have that sense 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.710
 clearly an advantage and 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.780
 before the more premium design 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.920
 then you definitely with you we are at 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.930
 and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.310
 disadvantage is that the battery is not 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.899
 that is interchangeable at the state of 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.850
 we sometimes also read a debate minor 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.469
 just pick it out you me it isn't 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.390
 That is how they look at the design from you 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.600
 I would say the new way further 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.960
 that your we design is much better 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.759
 evil screen 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.619
 they don't differ that much on paper 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.909
 many only screen technology that you have 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.009
 that psp 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.680
 Samsung has an amoled screen amoled 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.170
 Samsung's screen has a higher 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.310
 contrast and that is of course one 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.770
 advantage and on the other hand the color fastness 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.609
 is less the brightness of screen 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.070
 less 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.209
 and that would still two things together all 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.300
 say the screen of the hour we 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.560
 better is 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.320
 the screen doesn't differ that much 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 from each other only because of their color fastness 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.850
 and that clarity of the rough also points 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.860
 still go for that in terms of interface 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.090
 they both don't have the nicest 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.000
 interface that is there 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.410
 at company everywhere and on the kit cat 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 who you he i emotionally iphone 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.020
 we rent that has no menu that is 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.460
 getting used to it 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.590
 what is nice is that you deal with themes 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.600
 it can adjust easily 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.470
 functionally, less has been added 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.480
 at samsung 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.010
 the functions that is mainly a bit on 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.030
 the management of applications and what he 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.740
 not allowed 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.090
 as Samsung has a lot of function 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.950
 added for daily use 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.470
 For example it can make you look away 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.610
 movie then you automatically stop it 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.590
 screen keep looking at that screen 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 but the interface remains 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.610
 samsung may be more if possible 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.990
 So in a fair than yours we enter 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.040
 I would push that sentence before we go 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.080
 in terms of interface 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.610
 despite the fact that they both just do not have the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.900
 best and great interface my eyes 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.130
 and not very much apart 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.010
 walk 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.920
 the rental district has a quad core 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.120
 processor with arm cortex a9 cores the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.070
 Samsung also has a quad core 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.630
 processor but then with cry cores that 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.850
 cry cores that are theoretically broken 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.290
 faster cortex a9 cores practice 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.000
 Notice that the two devices do not match each other 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.000
 so much escaping the samsung is something 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.890
 faster if your application is side by side 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.930
 when it starts up, she will repent her films 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.670
 then watch his loading times by 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.900
 samsom just always just a bit shorter 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.310
 the difference is not that much 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.530
 So for the performance you don't need it 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.670
 principle not to do 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.310
 both cameras have a 13 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.050
 megapixel resolution there are in our 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.110
 better room on the market 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.760
 its just pretty good from smartphone 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.950
 both devices that just do that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.230
 reasonable and lots of differences 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.459
 there really is n't in the cameras that ura 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.620
 may have slightly pale colors 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.000
 what stands out at the samsung is that photos 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.230
 something in the moved that is in 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.200
 daily use of room of course 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.880
 annoying but yes you do not 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.870
 to do the difference in camera to the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.130
 rear end 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.620
 different camera on the front 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.930
 because you have an 8 megapixel 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.340
 selfie camera and there samsung can 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.720
 just really not up to par 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.460
 the quality of the camera is quite high 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.780
 and 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.220
 so if you go to the ultimate selfie 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.290
 If you are looking for a phone , you just have to 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.160
 At these hours we are only for whole 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.810
 many people it is natural 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.370
 hardly play a role in choosing 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.160
 from a smartphone 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.360
 the rent that we have to continue 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.620
 maybe a little less extra positions 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.420
 samsung samsung was populated one more 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.630
 infrared port here with which 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.050
 can control your tv and samsung again 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.790
 see 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.010
 software a lot more extra positions u 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.660
 proof but the rent your we have 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.920
 just yes , more premium 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.900
 user experience 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.480
 that screen that we better she prays selfie 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.610
 camera and also a lower price that hour 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.410
 work as around 330 euros 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.070
 while the sometimes from behind someone 70 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.050
 euro costs 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.790
 so all in all i would go for the u and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.110
 we enter into this although the two 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.410
 devices do not match each other so much 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.410
 evade
