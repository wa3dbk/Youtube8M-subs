00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
way to wear a scarf and I think my bet

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.099 
way to wear a scarf and I think my bet
the<00:00:14.370> best<00:00:14.610> advice<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.120> could<00:00:15.179> give<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:15.929> to

the best advice I could give would be to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.800 
the best advice I could give would be to
just<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:17.609> really<00:00:17.850> put<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.180> much<00:00:18.240> thought

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
just not really put that much thought

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.980 
just not really put that much thought
into<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.609> guess<00:00:21.119> people<00:00:21.330> seem<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> think

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
into it but I guess people seem to think

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.790 
into it but I guess people seem to think
that<00:00:22.230> there's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.740> way<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.590> cool<00:00:25.590> way<00:00:25.769> to

your neck but here's one sloppy cool way
and<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.430> Crocky<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.180> easy<00:00:42.390> way<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and one Crocky kind of easy way so the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.889 
and one Crocky kind of easy way so the
first<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.590> take<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> corner<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
first way would be to take a corner of

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.459 
first way would be to take a corner of
whatever<00:00:48.899> square<00:00:50.300> rectangle<00:00:51.300> triangle<00:00:51.750> scarf

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
whatever square rectangle triangle scarf

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.170 
whatever square rectangle triangle scarf
just<00:00:53.340> take<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> corner<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.239> even<00:00:54.420> be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
just take a corner it could even be

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.420 
just take a corner it could even be
we'll<00:00:55.450> start<00:00:55.810> like<00:00:56.050> this<00:00:56.230> to<00:00:56.410> see<00:00:56.620> one<00:00:56.830> end<00:00:57.100> of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
we'll start like this to see one end of

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.700 
we'll start like this to see one end of
it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.510 
it
so<00:00:59.710> take<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.070> corner<00:01:01.050> without

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.660 

take<00:01:07.520> one<00:01:07.820> end

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
take one end

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.600 
take one end
one<00:01:09.790> side<00:01:10.090> shorter

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
one side shorter

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.910 
one side shorter
loop<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.270> around<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:14.080> make<00:01:14.110> sure<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.770> nice

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
loop it around to make sure this is nice

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.430 
loop it around to make sure this is nice
and<00:01:14.980> close<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:16.600> about<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.200> middle<00:01:17.410> of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
and close right about to the middle of

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.680 
and close right about to the middle of
your<00:01:17.500> chest<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:18.760> there<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.330> have<00:01:19.480> both<00:01:19.660> sides

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
kind of evenly or under than leave any

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.130 
kind of evenly or under than leave any
doubt<00:01:22.900> on<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.230> side<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:25.300> one<00:01:25.510> thing<00:01:25.780> the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
doubt on the side so the one thing the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.430 
doubt on the side so the one thing the
one<00:01:26.170> problem<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:26.770> have<00:01:27.100> with<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:29.140> you<00:01:29.230> just

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
which is no good so what I do to avoid

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
easy sloppy look but kind of contrived

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.470 
easy sloppy look but kind of contrived
so<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.190> other<00:02:03.370> way<00:02:03.700> which<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.390> little

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
so the other way which is a little

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.790 
so the other way which is a little
preppy<00:02:05.170> ER<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.730> lot<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.090> people<00:02:07.390> know<00:02:07.540> this

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
preppy ER and a lot of people know this

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.970 
preppy ER and a lot of people know this
but<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.070> taking<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.790> scarf<00:02:10.440> take<00:02:11.440> each<00:02:11.620> end

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
but it's taking the scarf take each end

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.450 
but it's taking the scarf take each end
