00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.029
 Gabriel was already thinking about 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.779
 importance of fauna and flora in their 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.640
 day by day 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.289
 actually not covered but I have 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 aware that we must help 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 preserve our ecosystem so that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 we can live but this is a start 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.359
 experiencing today's professions 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.430
 talk about the career you care about 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 with nature and with our well-being 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 Let's know a bit more about 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 biology biology science studying 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 life 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.449
 she is especially dedicated to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 animal and plant life beyond the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 interest to study all beings 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.360
 live a professional biology must 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.820
 be willing to protect the environment 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.370
 environment and to preserve species 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.760
 used an attentive professional with 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 ability to reflect 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.970
 life in your details needs to be 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.790
 someone who likes to study has a lot of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.590
 curiosity and above all commitment 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.830
 with nature has to be a person 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.810
 curious to try everything inside that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.990
 is emerging in industry and biology 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.299
 have to be a creative professional 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.950
 innovative and always ready to open 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.070
 knowledge in biology is divided into 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.100
 four areas of biotechnology health middle 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 environment and education, and each 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.799
 its importance 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.750
 already stopped to think what would become of us 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.430
 without the vaccines because they were 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.369
 manufactured after much research 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.509
 of biotechnology biologists such as 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.210
 own name says a thousand né the use of agents 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.340
 for you to produce goods 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.860
 products or services 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.810
 then it is an area of ​​biology that involves 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.850
 multiple areas is more geared towards 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.610
 technology product process or service 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.910
 so is the biologist producing a pro 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 good end in the field of biology is the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.610
 study of the interaction of diseases of 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.600
 parasites of microorganism with the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.760
 cell or with the organism as a whole 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.350
 work in the training of professionals 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.080
 environmental 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.680
 the coming years will require us 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.300
 Further in-depth further qualification 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.120
 to meet the challenges of the environment 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.800
 environment has been bringing us all 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.280
 train well-trained people 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.950
 technically but above all 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.530
 able to act with ethics and this is a 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.170
 fundamental point in environmental training 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.720
 and the demand that we have to act 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.810
 as an environment teacher in the area of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.440
 biology it has to be formed in 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.440
 licenciatura and works with sciences in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.350
 primary education and biology in 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.860
 high school teacher 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.530
 curiosity alarm clock not to a student 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.180
 already comes with the natural curiosity and 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:23.269
 teacher has a role to play 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.269
 curiosity and show the knowledge 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 according to the federal biology council 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.630
 there is no wage floor for 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.030
 biologists , but timetables with the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.440
 minimum paid per hour of work 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.840
 divided into four categories 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.709
 for up to three years of training. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.400
 value is 40 reais from 3 to 5 years 60 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.769
 real 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.350
 already between six and 15 years of age or 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.310
 has a master's working hour of 90 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.870
 real 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.030
 professionals with 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.660
 doctorate with more than 15 years 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.820
 can earn R $ 150 per hour 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.900
 this value may change 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.880
 state to state 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.330
 in Rio de Janeiro the salary floor of a 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.989
 biologist from 1861 reais and forty 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.989
 four cents 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.400
 the course lasts for four years and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.100
 besides lectures students can 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.440
 learn practicing in laboratories 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.479
 I recommend any kind of internship not 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.489
 necessarily the one you crave 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.380
 to define 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.210
 Only in your life will you do 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.130
 those that appear the opportunities 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.259
 that appear 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.900
 gradually you will of course seeking 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.490
 what you are most interested in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.800
 always choosing with the heart of that 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.330
 you will learn in practice how to 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.979
 professional who already has an experience 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.020
 in that field and mainly by inserting 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.180
 professionally in that subject area 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.160
 is one of the opportunities that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.900
 important for the undergraduate student is 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.539
 that experience where the student of 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.030
 is found because we have 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.940
 a very high fan in biology daily 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.740
 so the sooner you start you 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.310
 can enter into this area of 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.440
 stage you can try and find 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.060
 where you really want a car despite 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 of the veiga is a university that 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.500
 this part of the practice, nor does it 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.080
 we have the field classes we 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.180
 have laboratories but on the stage 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.770
 different you have direct contact with 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.280
 the water you have already chosen to 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.900
 work and you're still in it then 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.940
 you learn a number of methods and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.580
 techniques that here in the university you 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.699
 only learned in theory the course of 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 biology of the grape it separates in the 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.250
 and a BS in ecology 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.110
 bachelors degree 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:45.770
 We have the prospect of making 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.900
 the student is and is seen in a study 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.889
 place in the labor market in the 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.199
 environmental 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.719
 That's why we invest a lot of work 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:58.009
 field in jobs within the 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:06:00.530
 laboratory is with studies with studies 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:04.340
 specific anatomy and physiology 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.430
 animal and plant life and especially with 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.990
 issue of environmental policy ltda 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.210
 environmental management 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.400
 here in the village of Almeida mainly 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.039
 the teachers are very teachers 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.169
 good doctors who bring a 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.360
 very big luggage for us and in 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.300
 becoming a real biologist 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.060
 demonstrating taste is also the whole area 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.680
 that we can act today experiencing it 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.900
 talked a little about who they are and what 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.729
 do the biologists take the myth of 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.509
 that biology was not linked to their 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.099
 friends 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.599
 if you have any questions about the 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.250
 work of a biologist, send your 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.009
 question to our production team 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.080
 through social networks of the single TV or 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:46.120
 Experiencing the professions stays here. 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.120
 bye bye and by the next program
