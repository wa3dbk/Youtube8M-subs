00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.570 
down my edges a time I scarf around the
edges<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.230> let<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.650> set<00:02:41.980> while<00:02:42.250> my<00:02:42.400> hair

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
edges and I let that set while my hair

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:53.370 
edges and I let that set while my hair
air<00:02:42.760> dry

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.530 

six<00:02:54.380> hours<00:02:54.800> later<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.400> my<00:02:55.790> hair<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.210> still

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
six hours later and my hair is still

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.320 
six hours later and my hair is still
damp<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:57.260> completely<00:02:57.860> wet<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.490> some<00:02:58.850> areas

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
damp and completely wet in some areas

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.870 
damp and completely wet in some areas
but<00:02:59.600> this<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.830> best<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.190> could<00:03:01.250> get<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.730> on

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
but this is the best I could get it on

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.720 
but this is the best I could get it on
its<00:03:02.030> own<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.260> defuse<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.070> this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
its own so I'm going to defuse it this

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.820 
its own so I'm going to defuse it this
was<00:03:05.120> my<00:03:05.390> first<00:03:05.630> time<00:03:05.870> using<00:03:06.140> these<00:03:06.380> products

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
was my first time using these products

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.830 
was my first time using these products
together<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.970> only<00:03:08.180> about<00:03:08.510> my

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
together and this is only about my

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.690 
together and this is only about my
fourth<00:03:09.230> wash<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.770> go<00:03:09.890> since<00:03:10.280> I've<00:03:10.460> been

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
fourth wash and go since I've been

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.120 
fourth wash and go since I've been
natural<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:12.230> whole<00:03:12.470> thing<00:03:12.530> was<00:03:12.800> a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
natural so this whole thing was a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.610 
natural so this whole thing was a
learning<00:03:13.340> experience<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.110> left<00:03:15.380> side

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
learning experience on the left side

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280 
learning experience on the left side
here<00:03:16.070> i'm<00:03:16.490> showing<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:17.030> how<00:03:17.270> i<00:03:17.300> used<00:03:17.690> a<00:03:17.900> small

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
here i'm showing you how i used a small

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.140 
here i'm showing you how i used a small
amount<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.770> gel<00:03:19.010> when<00:03:19.160> i<00:03:19.250> first<00:03:19.520> started<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
amount of gel when i first started and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.630 
amount of gel when i first started and
that<00:03:20.230> resulted<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.620> little<00:03:21.950> more<00:03:22.100> shrinkage

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
that resulted in a little more shrinkage

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.730 
that resulted in a little more shrinkage
when<00:03:23.240> i<00:03:23.270> applied<00:03:23.630> more<00:03:23.930> gel<00:03:24.230> like<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.560> did<00:03:24.709> on

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
when i applied more gel like I did on

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.130 
when i applied more gel like I did on
the<00:03:24.920> right<00:03:25.100> side<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.790> had<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.420> little<00:03:26.810> less

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
the right side I had a little less

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.650 
the right side I had a little less
shrinkage<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:28.340> shrinkage<00:03:28.820> nonetheless<00:03:29.180> so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
shrinkage but shrinkage nonetheless so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.270 
shrinkage but shrinkage nonetheless so
I've<00:03:29.840> changed<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> concentrator<00:03:31.070> nozzle

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
