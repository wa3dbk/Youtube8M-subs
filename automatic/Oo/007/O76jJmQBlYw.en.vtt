chai or just a few GP under that right

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.760 
chai or just a few GP under that right
now<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.450> means<00:02:09.660> parents<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.349> roughly

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

night each run will take four minutes

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.010 
night each run will take four minutes
this<00:02:26.980> means<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.340> only<00:02:27.520> make<00:02:27.700> 15<00:02:28.300> runs<00:02:28.570> per
