00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hi my name is Julianne cost and in this

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.949 
hi my name is Julianne cost and in this
quick<00:00:02.669> tip<00:00:03.000> we're<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.510> learn<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:03.929> to

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
quick tip we're going to learn how to

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.860 
quick tip we're going to learn how to
save<00:00:04.380> changes<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.700> make<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.120> Lightroom

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
save changes that you make in Lightroom

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.680 
save changes that you make in Lightroom
well<00:00:07.379> because<00:00:07.890> Lightroom<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.880> database

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
well because Lightroom is a database

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.470 
well because Lightroom is a database
program<00:00:09.870> that's<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> catalog<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.550> when

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
program that's what the catalog is when

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.970 
program that's what the catalog is when
you<00:00:12.630> make<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> change<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.290> Lightroom<00:00:13.650> Lightroom

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
you make a change in Lightroom Lightroom

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.279 
you make a change in Lightroom Lightroom
is<00:00:14.219> actually<00:00:14.490> automatically<00:00:15.299> saving<00:00:15.719> that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
is actually automatically saving that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.040 
is actually automatically saving that
change<00:00:16.740> into<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.609> database<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.690> example

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
change into the database so for example

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
change into the database so for example
if<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.199> tap<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.710> two<00:00:19.890> key<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> give<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.550> two

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
if I tap the two key to give this two

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
if I tap the two key to give this two
stars<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.420> information<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.109> saved<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
stars that information is saved in the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.370 
stars that information is saved in the
database<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.550> add<00:00:23.699> contact<00:00:24.510> information<00:00:25.109> or

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
database if I add contact information or

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.009 
database if I add contact information or
any<00:00:25.740> other<00:00:25.920> metadata<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.609> keywords<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.390> even

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
any other metadata like keywords or even

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.779 
any other metadata like keywords or even
if<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.320> over<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> develop<00:00:29.010> module<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
if I go over to the develop module and I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.250 
if I go over to the develop module and I
make<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> change<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.539> converting<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
make a change like converting this to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
make a change like converting this to
black<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.619> white<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.640> those<00:00:32.790> changes<00:00:33.239> are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
black and white all of those changes are

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.720 
black and white all of those changes are
being<00:00:33.570> saved<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.260> database<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.100> really

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
being saved in the database so really

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.479 
being saved in the database so really
you<00:00:35.850> don't<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.600> anything<00:00:37.129> now<00:00:38.129> if

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
you don't have to do anything now if

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
you don't have to do anything now if
you're<00:00:38.969> using<00:00:39.000> other<00:00:39.629> applications<00:00:40.469> for

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you're using other applications for

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440 
you're using other applications for
example<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.160> might<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.300> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
example you might also want to see this

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.560 
example you might also want to see this
image<00:00:42.809> using<00:00:43.290> Adobe<00:00:43.860> bridge<00:00:44.190> well<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:45.270> we

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
image using Adobe bridge well then we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.290 
image using Adobe bridge well then we
need<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> information<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:48.180> be

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
need a way to get the information to be

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900 
need a way to get the information to be
saved<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.870> only<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> database<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.340> also

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
saved not only to the database but also

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
saved not only to the database but also
somewhere<00:00:51.750> else<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> other

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
somewhere else so that that other

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.029 
somewhere else so that that other
external<00:00:53.699> application<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.660> access<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.320> now

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
external application can access it now

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.250 
external application can access it now
if<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.270> grid<00:00:57.510> view<00:00:57.539> you'll

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
if we go back to the grid view you'll

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
if we go back to the grid view you'll
notice<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.829> working<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.609> raw<00:01:00.030> file

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
notice that I'm working with a raw file

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.779 
notice that I'm working with a raw file
in<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.780> case<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> proprietary<00:01:02.100> raw<00:01:02.460> file

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
in this case it's a proprietary raw file

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.140 
in this case it's a proprietary raw file
so<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.140> were<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.129> save<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so if I were to want to save the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.890 
so if I were to want to save the
metadata<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.020> changes<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.790> image<00:01:09.270> with

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
metadata the changes to this image with

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
metadata the changes to this image with
it<00:01:10.049> selected<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it selected I would just go into the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
it selected I would just go into the
metadata<00:01:11.970> option<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> choose<00:01:13.290> save<00:01:13.830> metadata

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

to file or use command or control s now

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
to file or use command or control s now
I'll<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:18.990> ahead<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.500> choose<00:01:19.799> continue<00:01:20.490> here

I'll go ahead and choose continue here

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
I'll go ahead and choose continue here
but<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.180> telling<00:01:21.420> me<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.290> it's

but what it's telling me is that it's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920 
but what it's telling me is that it's
going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:23.070> write<00:01:23.400> an<00:01:23.670> XMP<00:01:24.540> sidecar

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.149 
need this XMP sidecar file because those
are<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.060> proprietary<00:01:51.420> file<00:01:52.170> formats<00:01:52.649> we

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
are not proprietary file formats we

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.889 
are not proprietary file formats we
understand<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> read<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> write<00:01:54.570> those

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
understand how to read and write those

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
understand how to read and write those
file<00:01:55.140> formats<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:56.100> push<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
file formats so we can actually push the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.170 
file formats so we can actually push the
changes<00:01:57.030> directly<00:01:57.689> into<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.680> files<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.399> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
changes directly into the files if I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
changes directly into the files if I
want<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> look<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> image<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.009> bridge

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
want to look at this image now in bridge

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.510 
want to look at this image now in bridge
I'll<00:02:02.640> simply<00:02:03.299> drag<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.200> image<00:02:04.530> down<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.100> top

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
I'll simply drag the image down on top

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.459 
I'll simply drag the image down on top
of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.060> bridge<00:02:06.329> icon<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.229> launch

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
of the bridge icon that will launch

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.100 
of the bridge icon that will launch
bridge<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.580> wasn't<00:02:08.879> launched<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.929> can

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
bridge if it wasn't launched and we can

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.809 
bridge if it wasn't launched and we can
see<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.590> folder<00:02:10.950> full<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> images<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
see that folder full of images and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.460 
see that folder full of images and
indeed<00:02:12.239> because<00:02:12.870> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
indeed because I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.400 
indeed because I
the<00:02:13.740> information<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.060> image<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.230> see

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
the information to that image we can see

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.780 
the information to that image we can see
here<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.650> bridge<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.040> there's<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:17.460> stars

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
here in bridge that there's two stars

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.270 
here in bridge that there's two stars
and<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.480> been<00:02:18.630> converted<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.350> black<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and it's been converted to black and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.430 
and it's been converted to black and
white<00:02:20.460> now<00:02:21.060> let's<00:02:21.390> return<00:02:21.570> back<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.200> Lightroom

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
white now let's return back to Lightroom

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.710 
white now let's return back to Lightroom
for<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> moment<00:02:23.160> because<00:02:23.310> if<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.540> is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
for a moment because if this is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.880 
for a moment because if this is
something<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.050> you're<00:02:25.230> doing<00:02:25.260> all<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> time

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
something that you're doing all the time

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
something that you're doing all the time
you<00:02:26.340> probably<00:02:26.370> don't<00:02:27.030> want<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.510> to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you probably don't want to have to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.950 
you probably don't want to have to
remember<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.820> manage<00:02:29.820> this<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.300> actually<00:02:30.480> you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
remember to manage this and actually you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.110 
remember to manage this and actually you
know<00:02:31.080> save<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.650> information<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.520> your<00:02:32.760> images

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
