top loader washing machines yeah they
sure<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.260> pretty<00:00:16.670> they<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.699> they're<00:00:18.119> coming

diamond dust

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.630 
diamond dust
pretty<00:00:25.260> much<00:00:25.380> anything<00:00:26.010> under<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> Sun

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
pretty much anything under the Sun

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.580 
pretty much anything under the Sun
that's<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.420> why<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.840> buy<00:00:28.019> these<00:00:28.080> pretty

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that's not why we buy these pretty

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
that's not why we buy these pretty
machines<00:00:29.179> sometimes<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.480> depending<00:00:30.900> on

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
machines sometimes it is depending on

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.530 
machines sometimes it is depending on
your<00:00:31.140> personality<00:00:31.619> actually<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
your personality actually but know the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
your personality actually but know the
reason<00:00:33.899> why<00:00:34.020> these<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.559> popular<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
reason why these are so popular is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.610 
reason why these are so popular is
because<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> energy<00:00:36.420> efficiency<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
because of the energy efficiency and the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
because of the energy efficiency and the
water<00:00:37.829> usage<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.850> course<00:00:39.149> Oregon<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.719> very

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
water usage of course Oregon is very

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.709 
water usage of course Oregon is very
very<00:00:40.379> green<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.090> important<00:00:42.570> for

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
very green and it's very important for

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.260 
very green and it's very important for
Oregonians<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.920> less<00:00:44.160> water<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.090> use

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
Oregonians to use less water and to use

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.690 
Oregonians to use less water and to use
less<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> natural<00:00:46.440> resources<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> that's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
less of the natural resources and that's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
less of the natural resources and that's
what<00:00:47.940> makes<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.570> popular<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
what makes these very popular now is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.130 
what makes these very popular now is
there<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> big<00:00:50.820> difference<00:00:51.239> between<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.899> front

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
there a big difference between the front

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.479 
there a big difference between the front
loader<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> top<00:00:52.710> loader<00:00:53.039> yeah

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
loader and the top loader yeah

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.580 
loader and the top loader yeah
traditionally<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> older-style<00:00:54.690> top<00:00:55.289> loader

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
traditionally the older-style top loader

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.849 
traditionally the older-style top loader
uses<00:00:56.129> about<00:00:56.520> 45<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> 50<00:00:57.750> gallons<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.350> water<00:00:58.410> per

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
uses about 45 to 50 gallons of water per

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
uses about 45 to 50 gallons of water per
load<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.910> new<00:01:00.090> energy<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.840> water

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
load and the new energy and water

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.779 
load and the new energy and water
efficient<00:01:01.620> front<00:01:01.920> loaders<00:01:02.250> you're<00:01:02.460> looking

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
efficient front loaders you're looking

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
efficient front loaders you're looking
at<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.149> 15<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> 18<00:01:03.809> gallons<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.369> get

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
at about 15 to 18 gallons and they get

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
at about 15 to 18 gallons and they get
your<00:01:05.670> clothes<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.180> clean<00:01:06.689> actually<00:01:07.530> cleaner

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
your clothes as clean actually cleaner

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
your clothes as clean actually cleaner
yeah<00:01:08.430> there's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> lot<00:01:09.030> more<00:01:09.210> action<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
yeah there's a lot more action in a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
yeah there's a lot more action in a
front<00:01:10.409> load<00:01:10.590> laundry<00:01:10.860> set<00:01:11.280> basically<00:01:11.970> what's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
front load laundry set basically what's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
front load laundry set basically what's
happening<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.869> an<00:01:13.020> older<00:01:13.320> style<00:01:13.500> top<00:01:13.830> load

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
happening with an older style top load

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
happening with an older style top load
you<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.520> agitator<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.840> clothes

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
are positioned in the washing machine

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.730 
are positioned in the washing machine
and<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> agitator<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.900> moving<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.470> but

of<00:01:23.610> suspended<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> agitator<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
of suspended there the agitator is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
of suspended there the agitator is
moving<00:01:25.439> around<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> front<00:01:26.790> load<00:01:27.060> your

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
moving around with the front load your

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
moving around with the front load your
clothes<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.780> being<00:01:27.869> cascaded<00:01:28.710> constantly

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
clothes are being cascaded constantly

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
clothes are being cascaded constantly
and<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> waters<00:01:29.790> actually<00:01:29.970> cascading

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and the waters actually cascading

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
and the waters actually cascading
through<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> clothes<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.759> constantly

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
through the clothes which is constantly

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
through the clothes which is constantly
pulling<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> removing<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> dirt<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
pulling and removing out the dirt and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
pulling and removing out the dirt and
it's<00:01:35.670> getting<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.240> turns<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it's getting a lot more turns and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's getting a lot more turns and
something<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.650> instead<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
something like that instead of a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
something like that instead of a
traditional<00:01:38.490> top<00:01:38.970> load<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.750> by<00:01:39.900> saving<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
traditional top load so by saving the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.100 
traditional top load so by saving the
energy<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.130> water<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.810> save

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
energy the water do you actually save

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
energy the water do you actually save
money<00:01:43.380> by<00:01:43.710> maybe<00:01:44.100> spending<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.700> bit

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
money by maybe spending a little bit

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
money by maybe spending a little bit
more<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> long<00:01:45.810> run<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> how<00:01:46.259> long<00:01:46.439> does

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
more in the long run and how long does
