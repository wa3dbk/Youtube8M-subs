00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.380

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 for toys she has what she needs 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:21.650
 and what you do not need balloons 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.880

 Amelia a tree house in there you can 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.620
 hiding as she hides 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.050
 the door is like the entrance door 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 the teddy she has my father so 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 get from her grandpa to the birth of the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 Above all, I am very attached to and become 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.829
 We always retain it 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.969
 the balls are still so belle the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.969

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.809

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.809

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:16.920
 he had here they can all with and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:22.479
 makes a noise I think it's great 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.200
 yes, so you can learn the children with it 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.530
 also goal 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.590
 here there is also so triangle 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.820
 square and of course a circle already 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:42.959
 but lost as you can see it 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.959
 can be quiet and window then it still has 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.470
 Of course, now say out of it 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.470
 grown but so small 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.280
 He has them in boxes with their names 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.110
 have made such a little here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.680
 ask, or rather, she does 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.819
 then yourself 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.260
 you do not see this candle now 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:34.750
 lights up then he plays in his sleep 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.750
 and the child can blow out the candle 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.569
 I think that's a night 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.980
 lamp 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.959
 There is also such a charging station 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.599
 then you can still do it can I am on 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.220
 this thing eleven each in elephants 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.610
 she also likes to watch it 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.840
 he turns the starry sky around here 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.510
 Of course you can see the blanket now 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.519
 There is not one day in different 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.700
 colors or he also changes the colors 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.680
 there is still music to it but me 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.870
 Would not recommend this music in the evening 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 otherwise the child will get it 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.780
 fearful moment I am 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.239
 terrible but the starry sky 10 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.090
 and the market first likes it then 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.190
 Of course you quark a lot of books 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.380
 says the little frog quite well 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.260
 I also like this book here really well 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.549
 I think that of ravensburger mine 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.579
 first dictionary we would be everyone 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.650

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.970
 fast here the typical ikea lamp 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.040
 maybe one or the other knows 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.819
 But I think she's great in the evening 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.220
 Let's do that 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.270

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.160
 Of course , questions like here are again 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.820
 a box full of toys 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.700
 Here is your vacuum cleaner 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.620

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.590

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.110

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:39.320
