course<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.370> these<00:00:44.520> units<00:00:44.760> were<00:00:44.879> built

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
course from when these units were built

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.110 
course from when these units were built
many<00:00:45.750> many<00:00:46.020> years<00:00:46.140> ago<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:47.820> I'd

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
many many years ago the first thing I'd

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
many many years ago the first thing I'd
like<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> show<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> course<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.860> new

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
like to show you is of course the new

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.660 
like to show you is of course the new
look<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> design<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> fixture

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
look and design of the of the fixture

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
look and design of the of the fixture
the<00:00:53.960> housing<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.379> aluminium<00:00:55.559> housing

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the housing is now an aluminium housing

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
the housing is now an aluminium housing
throughout<00:00:56.750> it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> retro<00:00:58.260> new<00:00:58.649> design<00:00:59.870> we

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
throughout it's a retro new design we

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
throughout it's a retro new design we
also<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.500> handle<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> rear<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.180> these

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
also have a handle at the rear so these

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
also have a handle at the rear so these
units<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.199> tungsten<00:01:04.890> filament<00:01:05.489> lamp<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
units are a tungsten filament lamp and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
units are a tungsten filament lamp and
so<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.479> makes<00:01:06.690> it<00:01:06.810> much<00:01:06.990> easier<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.710> handle

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so this makes it much easier to handle

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.029 
so this makes it much easier to handle
when<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.280> has<00:01:08.610> been<00:01:08.789> turned<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.539> and<00:01:10.289> being

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
when it has been turned on and being

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.969 
when it has been turned on and being
used<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.569> aluminium<00:01:12.979> accessory

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
used we also have an aluminium accessory

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.660 
used we also have an aluminium accessory
holder<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:15.500> accepts<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> shamira<00:01:17.009> speed

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
holder this accepts the shamira speed

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.809 
holder this accepts the shamira speed
ring<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.660> other<00:01:18.810> major<00:01:19.550> change<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.610> this

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
ring one other major change to this

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.160 
ring one other major change to this

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.729 
into the same lighting stands and
spigots<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.310> 16<00:03:46.640> millimeter<00:03:46.760> socket<00:03:47.739> we

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
spigots with a 16 millimeter socket we

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.470 
spigots with a 16 millimeter socket we
now<00:03:48.860> move<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.519> bigger<00:03:49.730> unit<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.299> air

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
now move on to the bigger unit the air

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.539 
now move on to the bigger unit the air
like<00:03:50.660> 2000<00:03:51.320> again<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.769> has<00:03:51.860> been<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.070> redesign

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
like 2000 again this has been a redesign

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.280 
like 2000 again this has been a redesign
in<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.000> aluminium<00:03:53.239> housing<00:03:53.900> as<00:03:54.019> we've

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
in the aluminium housing as we've

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.310 
in the aluminium housing as we've
mentioned<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.100> smaller<00:03:55.400> I'd<00:03:55.700> 750

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
mentioned in the in the smaller I'd 750

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.810 
mentioned in the in the smaller I'd 750
change<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.380> top<00:03:57.530> catch<00:03:57.739> same<00:03:58.280> top<00:03:58.459> catches

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
change the top catch same top catches

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.870 
change the top catch same top catches
the<00:03:58.910> air<00:03:58.970> about<00:03:59.120> 2,000<00:03:59.720> but<00:04:00.320> this<00:04:00.440> time<00:04:00.880> to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
the air about 2,000 but this time to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.850 
the air about 2,000 but this time to
change<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.480> lamp<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.049> much<00:04:03.290> simpler<00:04:03.590> and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
change the lamp is much simpler and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.280 
change the lamp is much simpler and
before<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.519> had<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.880> unscrew<00:04:05.030> certain<00:04:05.660> force

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
before you had to unscrew certain force

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.710 
before you had to unscrew certain force
to<00:04:06.470> get<00:04:06.590> into<00:04:06.739> the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
to get into the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.760 
to get into the
now<00:04:08.320> it's<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.620> simple<00:04:08.950> pull<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:10.060> opening<00:04:10.770> to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
now it's a simple pull and opening to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.260 
now it's a simple pull and opening to
change<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.100> lamp<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:12.880> it's<00:04:12.970> very<00:04:13.090> much

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
change the lamp so it's very much

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.970 
change the lamp so it's very much
simpler<00:04:15.000> we're<00:04:16.000> also<00:04:16.120> using<00:04:16.290> area<00:04:17.290> max<00:04:17.500> diode

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
simpler we're also using area max diode

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.490 
simpler we're also using area max diode
technology<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.359> for<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.870> reflectors<00:04:20.350> on

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
technology for the for the reflectors on

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.530 
technology for the for the reflectors on
both<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.709> these<00:04:20.950> units<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:22.060> gives<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.390> very

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
both of these units this gives a very

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.920 
both of these units this gives a very
wide<00:04:22.900> even<00:04:23.590> beam<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.360> it's<00:04:25.510> improved

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
wide even beam and so it's improved

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.040 
wide even beam and so it's improved
efficiency<00:04:26.650> with<00:04:27.070> it<00:04:27.190> with<00:04:27.340> these<00:04:27.430> fixtures

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
efficiency with it with these fixtures

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.420 
efficiency with it with these fixtures
and<00:04:29.050> as<00:04:29.170> with<00:04:29.350> again<00:04:29.530> with<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.710> true-blue<00:04:30.160> range

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430
