00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.320
 but not 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.950
 yes the first may is natural for us 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.720
 hunters a great moment the nature 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.310
 everything explodes green again the winter 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.450
 is over it is getting warmer again 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.450
 I also had a good time 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.460
 on 1 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320
 started in the dark and have already 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.360
 some hours we see 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.230
 fondling at the field while stalking 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.230
 was indeed swallow 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.650
 it was very hard to get there though 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.610
 one has also cameraman with it is 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.340
 of course, even heavier 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.780
 but it worked quite well 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.070
 had to go on the other side of the hedge 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.230
 that I do not look at the film 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.230
 we have several study 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 I think on 50-60 step arrived 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.670
 but that had the problem then 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.440
 with the wind of crisis for all 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 directions had to be expected 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.780
 the board unfortunately did not come and have us 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.800
 decided no I was already 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.800
 way back and quite unexpected came because 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 Rapeseed and soon much closer 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.880
 Come on and well I had one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.000
 Good edition and then we could 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.520
 stretch a piece but it went here 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 you can see the connection 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 Schnitter individual lung pieces lie 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 here , how can you already see in the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 Buck the deaths evasive seeger 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.470
 has taken the perfect first goes 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.360
 past 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 mari tonight still at moonshine 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.920
 shot and brave bockel stretches 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.050
 you can not believe it better 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.080
 says yes in may the movie is called 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.369
 yes vox 8 but since we have such a great moon 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.060
 we also had the defectors 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.470
 center so now we go to the evening sitting 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.729
 Difficulty is either over now 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.800
 This season we have many 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.030
 things seen with freshlings but it 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.069
 Of course, this is the season now 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.140
 incredibly difficult the defectors too 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.130
 you have to hunt in spite of the good light 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.900
 Of course, it's always one hundred percent 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.400
 be sure 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.790
 we have between two markdowns 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.920
 sat at digging experience shows the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.150
 the black game always digs 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 to scoop 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.730
 Of course I speculated on that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.340
 and now I pulled it up 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.629
 30 step on the open area pulled 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.780
 there we can address or live them 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.629
 it is a pity that we do not have this courage 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.939
 but the guess was 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.959
 really wanted the overflows today 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.170
 scoop up 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.519
 and here we have just taken care of her 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.989
 Here we were also nice and clean 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.930
 appeal in the year of the year again 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.720
 sat upstairs and more pleased 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.840
 always particularly waidmannsheil if one 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.909
 so overrunners can stretch at 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.909
 the second pillar that was very strange 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.079
 We had killed the cameraman 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.310
 had to recover the piece 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.379
 we have the thing carried back and 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.760
 there was already the new rotten sow 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.310
 the edge of the forest we can also enter 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.859
 defector out succumb yes if it does then 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.790
 first then it runs on the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.169
 away back to the car we have one 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.359
 second roger hit the forest edge 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.930
 stood and could also be a defector 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.930
 lay 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200
 the morning ps when it's still dark 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.670
 Of course it's a very special one 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.890
 moment 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.209
 the birds start to twitter that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.910
 Of course, life awakens a dream 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.319
 when the wildlife awakes and you have it 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.569
 seen that deer actually everywhere 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.739
 on the way and good in those big ones 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.480
 Of course you have to give advice as well 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.000
 arrive because this regulates white 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.819
 Of course we are also great 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.090
 We decided to speak the language 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.090
 succumb 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.370
 we got the ball free but 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.610
 now on the first of may you can still 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.060
 good mari different from the recker 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.060
 past or weak
