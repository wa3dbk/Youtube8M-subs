was<00:00:41.059> basically<00:00:41.719> it

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
was basically it

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.860 
was basically it
it<00:00:42.229> wasn't<00:00:42.589> it<00:00:43.249> wasn't<00:00:43.399> game<00:00:43.670> plans<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.449> wasn't

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
it wasn't it wasn't game plans it wasn't

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.989 
it wasn't it wasn't game plans it wasn't
what<00:00:45.829> we've<00:00:45.949> been<00:00:46.100> touching<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.579> week<00:00:46.699> it's

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
what we've been touching the week it's

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.779 
what we've been touching the week it's
just<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.239> fact<00:00:47.449> we<00:00:47.539> didn't<00:00:47.809> do<00:00:48.499> it<00:00:48.670> with<00:00:49.670> what

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
just the fact we didn't do it with what

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.489 
just the fact we didn't do it with what
the<00:00:49.879> stuff<00:00:50.059> would<00:00:50.179> worked<00:00:50.389> on<00:00:50.539> all<00:00:50.719> week<00:00:50.929> both

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
the stuff would worked on all week both

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.879 
the stuff would worked on all week both
games<00:00:51.829> we<00:00:52.519> didn't<00:00:52.760> do<00:00:52.940> it<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.539> I<00:00:53.600> think<00:00:54.589> both

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:54.889 
games we didn't do it and I think both

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.430 
games we didn't do it and I think both
games<00:00:55.280> were<00:00:55.699> just<00:00:55.729> basically<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.749> worked<00:00:57.139> and

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
games were just basically I worked and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.869 
games were just basically I worked and
all<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.620> boys<00:00:57.920> would<00:00:58.129> put<00:00:58.460> their<00:00:58.549> hand<00:00:58.699> up<00:00:58.789> and

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
all the boys would put their hand up and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.770 
all the boys would put their hand up and
say<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.389> think<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.049> was<00:01:00.139> basically<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:00.949> fact

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
say I think that was basically the fact

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.390 
say I think that was basically the fact
especially<00:01:02.780> we<00:01:03.170> can't<00:01:03.350> just<00:01:03.530> gone<00:01:03.709> the<00:01:04.070> Blues

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
especially we can't just gone the Blues

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.480 
especially we can't just gone the Blues
just<00:01:04.610> basically<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:06.290> attack<00:01:06.590> then<00:01:06.890> doing

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
just basically the attack then doing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.279 
just basically the attack then doing
fancy<00:01:07.760> moves<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:08.329> I<00:01:08.479> were<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.960> throw<00:01:09.079> in<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
fancy moves this I were to throw in the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.260 
fancy moves this I were to throw in the
corner<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.710> that's<00:01:10.219> what<00:01:10.399> cost<00:01:10.579> us<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.850> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
corner and that's what cost us in the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.870 
corner and that's what cost us in the
end<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.189> we're<00:01:13.189> just<00:01:13.250> hitting<00:01:13.430> up<00:01:13.670> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
end and we're just hitting up and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.480 
end and we're just hitting up and
running<00:01:14.390> around<00:01:14.450> quicker<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.219> go

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
running around quicker and we have to go

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.209 
running around quicker and we have to go
backwards<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:16.909> defense<00:01:17.240> softer<00:01:17.810> defense

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219

straight away but obviously we know a
soft<00:01:22.070> defense<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:23.210> may<00:01:23.329> close<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.570> yards<00:01:23.960> and

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
soft defense the may close the yards and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
picture he can do that for and that's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.380 
picture he can do that for and that's
where<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.310> comes<00:01:28.460> down<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.240> core

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
where it comes down to that and the core

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
by getting some principles these last

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.020 
by getting some principles these last
two<00:04:09.519> games<00:04:09.900> lay<00:04:10.900> down<00:04:11.199> so<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.799> can<00:04:11.829> finish<00:04:12.819> on<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
two games lay down so it can finish on a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.059 
two games lay down so it can finish on a
high<00:04:13.090> note<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.599> care

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
high note and care

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.400 
high note and care
through<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.180> gonna<00:04:15.659> get<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.870> rebuild<00:04:16.199> over

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
through and gonna get the rebuild over

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.620 
through and gonna get the rebuild over
the<00:04:16.470> summer<00:04:16.910> played<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.000> lot<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.209> rugby<00:04:18.359> nice

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630

fish<00:04:18.840> I'll<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.109> intercept<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> toy<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:20.549> think

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
fish I'll just intercept a toy I think

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.850 
fish I'll just intercept a toy I think
so<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:20.970> think<00:04:21.090> we've<00:04:21.299> got<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.479> summer<00:04:22.139> tour<00:04:22.380> to

brought<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.580> table<00:05:20.699> so<00:05:21.320> again<00:05:22.320> it's<00:05:22.530> it's

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
brought to the table so again it's it's

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.130 
brought to the table so again it's it's
mind-blowing<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:25.680> me<00:05:25.800> anyway
