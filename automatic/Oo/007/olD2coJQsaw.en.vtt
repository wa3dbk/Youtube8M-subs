 remembering that this background gameplay is

 It has since started to decline but 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.310
 How are you both talking a lot? 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.080

 to have no problem so do not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.800
 come on scolding and in the comments while speaking 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.240
 the average then we go there your desire of 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.790
 Ask a question here for the guys 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 to understand a little more what motivated you 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.780
 is to make the radios 20 motive you try 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.720
 leave this career rather racks and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.179
 it was handwritten for us then everything 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.459
 started but average 2009/2010 out there right? 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:43.319
 reprehensible two of you for also got 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:46.020
 that only the former pilots movement of this 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:50.880
 I used to stay in a room 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 Sobis mw3 also walked a lot and spent 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.789
 look so I admired my that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.390
 My dear guy and focus on doing these things. 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:05.459
 thence until the beginning of last year 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.740
 box 8 bad guy and I talked to 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.760
 a sucker, I went there and bought a 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.400
 xbox 360 collector of that region 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.410
 given elbowed him and now rather 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.230
 Do it for the people, right? 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.780
 of course with basic precinho so that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.910
 also investigates caramba instead of $ 800 of the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.640
 server but basically what 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.349
 inspired to do that was gringa 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.930
 playing fetch the dead woman herself 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.370
 I got pirated phone enabled 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.280
 the cool is cool, this is it people you 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.140
 sees that everyone has an inspiration neither 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.840
 always a radio that everyone talks about 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.450
 rake what the shit is 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.189
 I arrived is dishonest no guys at 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.040
 Sometimes we play games for finding 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.889
 cool for having fun not for causing with 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.349
 people and I would like so from the bottom 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.209
 from the heart that matheus now descends to 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.639
 his word about people who curse 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.590
 people who speak or mateus and not be 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.599
 gets into the call of duty stay 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.129
 killing the people with god mode that you 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.069
 people who can not separate the 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.780
 which is fun than touching the whorehouse 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.340
 understood a screen that I wanted your 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.840
 opinion on this the guy talks to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.870
 The people on the channel have a lot of people 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.049
 Stressed out of crying. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.849
 look at the three adins on the danielle canal 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.889
 game, the channel is also looking 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:29.319
 one looks the following honey rgh is you have 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.439
 access to everything so we make people 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.959
 play is what you have to use to haiti have 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.810
 access to everything that allows it 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.389
 You also have to understand that we 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.829
 talking the game to hurt is not in the 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.739
 play to make a greater dispersion 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.340
 happen is also so basically it is 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.409
 But it's not important, it's not important. 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.269
 So the sister then you see the time that 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.060
 he can not mix in this thing of 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.709
 whore with a do good things to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.859
 people there play help people 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.579
 play in an internet room in the 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.069
 people 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.409
 this got the feeling that complaining at the 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.060
 To taste his with you said 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.579
 when the guy gets there pull the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.259
 negative took dread light 11 iron 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.669
 Lane said forever and never again 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:17.169
 It will be that way, because you 're doing it. 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.030
 selling these things 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.210
 the person who goes to buy in the baby is not 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.190
 cloud her which is to have a moment of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.080
 happiness with face and family father who 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.150
 Can not play every day, we do. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.520
 For him, on his account, he can have a 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.340
 cool and type status the guy is happy 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.400
 answered in fact is so is each one 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.440
 possible if you do not like it of course 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.570
 I respected forcing you to do something. 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.700
 You do not want to, but so do you. 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.889
 also have to respect looks that make the 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.020
 our content 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.669
 the work is not just because he buys that 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.680
 club sometimes the guy with the cast and 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.509
 so for those who will buy a hatred and 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.580
 I continue to have a greater dispersion 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.919
 game for doing things at stake not 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.539
 allowing the network to truly 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.249
 So we closed this 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.259
 here about the ratings on 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.759
 the ways that you have doubts then 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.039
