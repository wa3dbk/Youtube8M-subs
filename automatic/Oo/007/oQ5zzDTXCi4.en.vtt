some weapon variety to himself which I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.090 
some weapon variety to himself which I
love<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.060> too<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.050> one<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.500> closest

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
love that too this is one of the closest

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.400 
love that too this is one of the closest
games<00:02:50.340> i<00:02:50.580> think<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.930> fact<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
games i think is the fact it is the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
games i think is the fact it is the
closest<00:02:52.950> game<00:02:53.130> possible<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.880> Call<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.090> Duty<00:02:54.360> I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
closest game possible in Call of Duty I

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.550 
closest game possible in Call of Duty I
don't<00:02:54.600> think<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> game<00:02:54.960> could<00:02:55.170> get<00:02:55.260> possibly

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
don't think a game could get possibly

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.020 
don't think a game could get possibly
closer<00:02:56.130> than<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:56.580> it's<00:02:56.730> gonna<00:02:56.820> be<00:02:56.910> pretty

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
closer than that so it's gonna be pretty

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.670 
closer than that so it's gonna be pretty
cool<00:02:57.330> let's<00:02:57.900> actually<00:02:58.080> start<00:02:58.230> talk<00:02:58.530> about

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680

the bee flag in domination it's really

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.740 
the bee flag in domination it's really
not<00:04:38.220> fun<00:04:38.520> but<00:04:38.729> when<00:04:38.880> you're<00:04:39.000> actually<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.419> this

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
not fun but when you're actually in this

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.870 
not fun but when you're actually in this
building<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:40.919> actually<00:04:41.069> a<00:04:41.250> really<00:04:41.400> fun<00:04:41.639> map

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
building it's actually a really fun map

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.820 
building it's actually a really fun map
so<00:04:42.150> I'm<00:04:42.360> kind<00:04:42.569> of<00:04:42.599> torn<00:04:42.810> on<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.530> map

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
so I'm kind of torn on on the map

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.320 
so I'm kind of torn on on the map
stormfront<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.550> don't<00:04:44.699> know<00:04:44.759> if<00:04:44.849> I<00:04:44.910> like<00:04:44.940> it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330
