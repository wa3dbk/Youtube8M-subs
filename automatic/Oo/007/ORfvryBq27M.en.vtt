 believe on the app store 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.759
 so this obligation is unfair 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.280

 dropbox and hormone officer 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.600
 squarely on the application 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.290
 then you can obviously protect 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:07.549
 implication by a code like this 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.899

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.200
 and that's it for you can 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.969
 also create folders obviously so 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 it is when you leave pressed hop 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.530
 here you are at a small menu you can 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.149
 refresh a little bit just import 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.869
 photos create a folder a new 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.619
 text 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.509
 then you can make a text file 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.829
 could make a multiple selection or 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.100
 if you click on selection its 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.779
 seleccion all of a sudden so he has a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.740
 built-in player is excellent look 

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:47.999

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.200
 waiting there you put the music that 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.039
 even walks on the lockscreen when 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:57.359

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 even grandpa with the music player so 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:04.229
 you download the browsers that get 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.149
 find there a present of times from here to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.670
 the arrival on the browser admit 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.990

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.910
 between the between applications like this 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.300

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.940
 multiple selection folder and so on 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 icons just down here it's here 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.480
