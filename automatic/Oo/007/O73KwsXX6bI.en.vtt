00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
show you a new look involving a tool

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580 
show you a new look involving a tool
that<00:00:11.849> has<00:00:12.030> recently<00:00:12.330> become<00:00:12.900> quite<00:00:13.380> popular

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that has recently become quite popular

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.519 
that has recently become quite popular
it's<00:00:14.190> called<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> curling<00:00:15.089> wand<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:16.320> thing

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
it's called the curling wand the thing

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.900 
it's called the curling wand the thing
that<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.830> different<00:00:17.039> about<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.490> curling<00:00:17.850> wand

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
that is different about the curling wand

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.660 
that is different about the curling wand
versus<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> curling<00:00:19.050> iron<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.680> there's<00:00:20.369> no

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
versus the curling iron is there's no

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.660 
versus the curling iron is there's no
clip<00:00:21.060> involved<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.920> when<00:00:23.160> you're<00:00:23.279> wrapping

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
clip involved so when you're wrapping

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.980 
clip involved so when you're wrapping
your<00:00:23.699> hair<00:00:24.029> around<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.420> you're<00:00:24.570> wrapping<00:00:24.960> your

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
your hair around it you're wrapping your

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.140 
your hair around it you're wrapping your
hair<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> heat<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.580> barrel<00:00:26.970> as

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
hair right on the heat of the barrel as

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.870 
hair right on the heat of the barrel as
well<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.380> you're<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.710> overlapping<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.670> hair

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
well as you're not overlapping your hair

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880 
well as you're not overlapping your hair
with<00:00:30.119> your<00:00:30.150> other<00:00:30.510> hair<00:00:30.869> when<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.710> that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
with your other hair when you do that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.650 
with your other hair when you do that
that's<00:00:32.099> generally<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:32.790> your<00:00:32.940> curls<00:00:33.300> fall

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that's generally when your curls fall

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
that's generally when your curls fall
and<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.530> they<00:00:34.649> don't<00:00:34.770> stay<00:00:35.100> nice<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.820> bouncy

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and when they don't stay nice and bouncy

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.810 
and when they don't stay nice and bouncy
so<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> curling<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.370> like

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so with the curling one you can see like

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
so with the curling one you can see like
I<00:00:38.940> said<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.239> quite<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> curling<00:00:40.469> iron

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I said it is quite like a curling iron

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580 
I said it is quite like a curling iron
except<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> does<00:00:41.430> taper<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.510> end<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
except it does taper at the end of the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.670 
except it does taper at the end of the
barrel<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.969> there's<00:00:45.149> no<00:00:45.360> clip<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.649> hold

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
barrel and then there's no clip to hold

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.670 
barrel and then there's no clip to hold
it<00:00:47.039> open<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.460> hold<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:47.969> hair<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:49.200> comes

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
with this handy dandy heat-resistant

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
with this handy dandy heat-resistant
glove<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> no<00:00:55.020> clip<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> have

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
glove because there is no clip you have

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
left hand because I am right-handed so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.599 
left hand because I am right-handed so
you're<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.559> put<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> opposite

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you're going to put it on the opposite

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
you're going to put it on the opposite
hand<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.570> what<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.439> I'll<00:01:05.309> show<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
hand of what you are and I'll show you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
hand of what you are and I'll show you
really<00:01:05.909> quickly<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.659> two<00:01:06.990> different

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
really quickly there are two different

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.550 
really quickly there are two different
sizes<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> curling<00:01:08.939> wand

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
sizes that I have of the curling wand

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.929 
sizes that I have of the curling wand
this<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> produce<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.790> much

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this one here is going to produce a much

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.719 
this one here is going to produce a much
tighter<00:01:12.360> curl<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> tapers<00:01:14.520> at

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
tighter curl as you can see it tapers at

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.550 
tighter curl as you can see it tapers at
the<00:01:14.880> barrel<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> reason<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the barrel here and the reason for that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
the barrel here and the reason for that
is<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
is because the look that's really in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
is because the look that's really in
right<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:18.840> has<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> roots<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.890> little<00:01:19.920> bit

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
right now has the roots a little bit

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
right now has the roots a little bit
straighter<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.600> ends<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.110> bit

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
straighter and the ends a little bit

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
straighter and the ends a little bit
curlier<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.549> wrapping<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.060> hair

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
curlier so as you're wrapping the hair

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.370 
curlier so as you're wrapping the hair
down<00:01:24.479> you're<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> ends

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
down you're going to see the ends

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.899 
down you're going to see the ends
getting<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.740> bit<00:01:25.950> curlier<00:01:26.340> while

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
getting a little bit curlier while

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.130 
getting a little bit curlier while
keeping<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> roots<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:27.840> bit

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
keeping the roots a little bit

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380 
keeping the roots a little bit
straighter<00:01:28.520> same<00:01:29.520> goes<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.119> bigger

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
straighter same goes with this bigger

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
straighter same goes with this bigger
one<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.770> one's<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> bit<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
one here this one's for a bit of a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
one here this one's for a bit of a
looser<00:01:32.850> beach<00:01:33.090> wave<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> said<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
looser beach wave and like I said it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.850 
looser beach wave and like I said it
tapers<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> end<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.560> make<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> ends

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
tapers at the end just to make the ends

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
tapers at the end just to make the ends
a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.159> curlier<00:01:39.140> okay<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.470> going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
a little bit curlier okay so I'm going

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
a little bit curlier okay so I'm going
to<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.040> smaller<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> two<00:01:41.909> irons<00:01:42.420> just
