Cory<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.700> good<00:00:14.940> morning<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.509> where<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
Cory and good morning that's where is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.460 
Cory and good morning that's where is
this<00:00:16.770> planet<00:00:17.670> well<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.810> 600

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
this planet well it's it's 600

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.010 
this planet well it's it's 600
light-years<00:00:19.710> away<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.840> not<00:00:21.840> gonna<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
light-years away which is not gonna be

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.450 
light-years away which is not gonna be
traveling<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:22.590> anytime<00:00:22.800> soon<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.279> think

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
traveling there anytime soon I think

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
traveling there anytime soon I think
that<00:00:23.580> NASA<00:00:24.090> calculated<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.109> would<00:00:25.199> take<00:00:25.320> 22

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that NASA calculated it would take 22

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.960 
that NASA calculated it would take 22
million<00:00:26.039> years<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.490> space<00:00:26.670> shuttle<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
million years on the space shuttle to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
million years on the space shuttle to
get<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.439> now<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.039> look

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
get there so right now it's it's look

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.810 
get there so right now it's it's look
but<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.580> touch

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
but don't touch

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.900 
but don't touch
how<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.949> 600<00:00:32.730> light

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
how do we see this if it's 600 light

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.510 
how do we see this if it's 600 light
years<00:00:32.940> away<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.950> massive

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
years away this is it's a it's a massive

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.410 
years away this is it's a it's a massive
servitor<00:00:35.850> II<00:00:35.910> called<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> kepler

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
servitor II called the kepler

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
servitor II called the kepler
observatory<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> basically<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:38.190> looks<00:00:38.309> at

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
observatory and basically it looks at

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
observatory and basically it looks at
stars<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.059> watches<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> planet

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
stars and it watches when the planet

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
stars and it watches when the planet
passes<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.649> front<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.980> star<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> teeny

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
passes in front of star you get a teeny

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389 
passes in front of star you get a teeny
tiny<00:00:42.030> shadow<00:00:42.329> its<00:00:42.690> watches<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> shadow<00:00:43.920> uses

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
tiny shadow its watches the shadow uses

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
tiny shadow its watches the shadow uses
the<00:00:44.489> shadow<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.910> measure<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> size<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the shadow to measure the size the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.959 
the shadow to measure the size the
planet<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.860> how<00:00:47.489> close<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
planet what it's like how close it is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
planet what it's like how close it is
how<00:00:48.239> warm<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.320> saying

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
how warm it is but but you're saying

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
how warm it is but but you're saying
that<00:00:49.890> they've<00:00:50.309> found<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.420> thousand

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that they've found what two thousand

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.990 
that they've found what two thousand
planets<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> our<00:00:52.980> solar<00:00:53.010> system<00:00:53.340> well<00:00:53.910> these

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
planets in our solar system well these

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
planets in our solar system well these
are<00:00:54.149> two<00:00:54.480> thousand<00:00:54.780> planets<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.199> very

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
are two thousand planets are is very

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
are two thousand planets are is very
special<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> fine<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
special this is the fine this is the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.930 
special this is the fine this is the
first<00:00:58.559> planet<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:58.980> found<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.789> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
first planet they found that is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.180 
first planet they found that is
plausibly<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> earth<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
plausibly like the earth it's about the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.590 
plausibly like the earth it's about the
size<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> earth<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.449> bit

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
size of the earth it's just a little bit

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
size of the earth it's just a little bit
larger<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> said<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.070> earth

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
larger and like you said it's it's earth

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.980 
larger and like you said it's it's earth
temperature<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> right<00:01:06.630> temperature

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
temperature it's the right temperature

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
temperature it's the right temperature
for<00:01:07.020> water<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.979> fact<00:01:08.130> they're<00:01:08.790> thinking

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
for water and in fact they're thinking

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.190 
for water and in fact they're thinking
this<00:01:09.119> might<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> water<00:01:09.960> world

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this might actually be a water world

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.420 
this might actually be a water world
this<00:01:10.439> might<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.770> ocean<00:01:11.070> planet

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
this might be an ocean planet

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
this might be an ocean planet
you<00:01:11.549> mean<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> whole<00:01:12.060> planet<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> consists<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you mean the whole planet is consists of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
you mean the whole planet is consists of
water<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.280> isn't<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.909> we're<00:01:15.060> looking

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
water but isn't that what we're looking

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.510 
water but isn't that what we're looking
for<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.659> Mars<00:01:15.960> yes<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.340> NASA

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
for on Mars yes because that's what NASA

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
for on Mars yes because that's what NASA
thinks<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.180> unlock<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> key<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> whether

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
thinks would unlock the key to whether

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.240 
thinks would unlock the key to whether
or<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:19.619> other<00:01:19.740> life<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.220> there

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
or not there's other life out there

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
or not there's other life out there
exactly<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> idea<00:01:21.390> thing<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> where<00:01:22.020> there's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
exactly the idea thing is where there's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.359 
exactly the idea thing is where there's
where<00:01:22.470> there's<00:01:22.619> water<00:01:22.799> there's<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.189> good

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
where there's water there's a good

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.340 
where there's water there's a good
chance<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> life<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.750> Mars<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.200> we're

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
chance of life well Mars you know we're

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.510 
chance of life well Mars you know we're
looking<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.830> bits<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.070> water<00:01:26.280> this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
looking for little bits of water this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
looking for little bits of water this
might<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> planet<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.330> covered<00:01:27.900> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
might be a planet that's covered in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710 
might be a planet that's covered in
water<00:01:28.140> might<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.159> et<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.030> shark<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
water might be you know et the shark the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
water might be you know et the shark the
article<00:01:31.259> said<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.860> took<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> space

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
article said if you took the space

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
article said if you took the space
shuttle<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.450> mentioned<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.350> would

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
shuttle you just mentioned this it would

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.550 
shuttle you just mentioned this it would
take<00:01:34.770> 22<00:01:35.490> million<00:01:35.880> years<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.079> yeah

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
take 22 million years to get there yeah

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
take 22 million years to get there yeah
you'd<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> pack<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> supplies<00:01:38.579> how

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you'd have to pack a lot of supplies how

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.179 
you'd have to pack a lot of supplies how
are<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:39.600> able<00:01:40.259> pack<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> supplies

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
are we now able pack a lot of supplies

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.330 
are we now able pack a lot of supplies
peg<00:01:41.700> lunch<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.350> how<00:01:43.619> are<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.890> able<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
peg lunch and then so how are we able to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.999 
peg lunch and then so how are we able to
see<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.970> deep<00:01:45.299> into<00:01:45.600> space<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.890> if

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
see this deep into space now because if

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
see this deep into space now because if
we<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.130> keep<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.640> deeper<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> deeper

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
we just keep going deeper and deeper

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
we just keep going deeper and deeper
Cory<00:01:49.079> yeah<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.159> mean<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
Cory yeah so this is I mean this is the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.620 
Cory yeah so this is I mean this is the
incredible<00:01:50.970> thing<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.180> these<00:01:51.299> telescopes

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
incredible thing with these telescopes

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770 
incredible thing with these telescopes
these<00:01:52.200> telescopes<00:01:53.420> physically<00:01:54.420> traveling

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
these telescopes physically traveling

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.569 
these telescopes physically traveling
through<00:01:54.960> space<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.340> slow

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
through space is a very very slow

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
through space is a very very slow
process<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.810> soon<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.290> working

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
process but as soon as you're working

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620 
process but as soon as you're working
with<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> telescope<00:01:59.369> it's<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.450> mind

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
with the telescope it's like your mind

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.030 
with the telescope it's like your mind
could<00:02:00.869> operate<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> speed<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> light<00:02:01.799> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
could operate at the speed of light you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.670 
could operate at the speed of light you
can<00:02:02.340> as<00:02:02.670> far<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.270> light<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.659> travel<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:04.530> can

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
can as far as light can travel we can

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
can as far as light can travel we can
see<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.729> study<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> universe

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
see and we can we can study the universe

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.930 
see and we can we can study the universe
it<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.899> remarkable<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it is remarkable that what what is the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.880 
it is remarkable that what what is the
significance<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.200> 72<00:02:10.950> degree

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
significance of a 72 degree

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.040 
significance of a 72 degree
planet<00:02:12.250> surface<00:02:12.580> why<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:13.569> important

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
planet surface why is that so important

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.809 
planet surface why is that so important
well<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.800> really<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.160> all<00:02:15.340> comes<00:02:15.610> back<00:02:15.700> to

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
well so it really it all comes back to

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.730 
well so it really it all comes back to
water<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.390> comes<00:02:16.720> back<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.350> planet

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
water it comes back to this is a planet

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.410 
water it comes back to this is a planet
that<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:18.040> around<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.760> right<00:02:18.910> kind<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.180> star

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
that is around the right kind of star

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.180 
that is around the right kind of star
it's<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> right<00:02:20.380> size<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.010> right

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
it's the right size it's the right

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.100 
it's the right size it's the right
distance<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> plant<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.780> has<00:02:22.870> all

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
distance this is a plant that has all

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.360 
distance this is a plant that has all
the<00:02:23.290> conditions<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.800> life<00:02:23.920> has<00:02:24.160> all<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the conditions for life has all the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.260 
the conditions for life has all the
conditions<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.930> Earth<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.310> you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
conditions to be like Earth and so you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.430 
conditions to be like Earth and so you
know<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:28.840> button<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.260> mean

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
know it's on the right button I mean

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.320 
know it's on the right button I mean
water<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.010> real<00:02:30.310> key<00:02:30.490> thing<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.209> right

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
water is the real key thing in the right

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.880 
water is the real key thing in the right
temperature<00:02:31.750> for<00:02:31.930> water<00:02:32.050> that's<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.680> place

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
temperature for water that's a place

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.840 
temperature for water that's a place
where<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.340> all<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> ingredients

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
where you have all the ingredients

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.610 
where you have all the ingredients
everything's<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:34.570> place<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.080> also<00:02:35.260> they're

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
everything's in place and also they're

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.960 
everything's in place and also they're
already<00:02:35.770> saying<00:02:36.040> there's<00:02:36.310> 290<00:02:37.270> days<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.690> year

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
already saying there's 290 days a year

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
already saying there's 290 days a year
now<00:02:39.970> III<00:02:40.480> guess<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:41.470> determined<00:02:42.010> by

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
now III guess that that's determined by

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.180 
now III guess that that's determined by
the<00:02:42.190> Sun<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.170> orbit<00:02:44.350> right

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the Sun that that is in the orbit right

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
the Sun that that is in the orbit right
so<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.880> Sun<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.600> planet<00:02:47.110> orbits

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
so or the Sun that this planet orbits

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.050 
so or the Sun that this planet orbits
right<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.040> planets<00:02:48.310> orbiting<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.670> Sun

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
right so it's planets orbiting a Sun

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.340 
right so it's planets orbiting a Sun
that's<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.270> lot<00:02:49.450> like<00:02:49.540> ours<00:02:49.870> except<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.320> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
that's a lot like ours except it's a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.810 
that's a lot like ours except it's a
little<00:02:50.530> bit<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.890> little<00:02:51.070> bit<00:02:51.190> smaller<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.640> little

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
little bit a little bit smaller a little

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.430 
little bit a little bit smaller a little
bit<00:02:52.030> redder<00:02:52.269> if<00:02:52.570> you're<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> science<00:02:53.350> fiction

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
bit redder if you're a science fiction

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.780 
bit redder if you're a science fiction
buff<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.890> know<00:02:54.040> that's<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:54.550> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
buff you know that's that's the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.250 
buff you know that's that's the
description<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.239> Superman's<00:02:55.660> Sun<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.170> I'm

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
description of Superman's Sun but I'm

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.630 
description of Superman's Sun but I'm
not<00:02:56.350> saying<00:02:56.650> there's<00:02:56.800> Superman<00:02:57.040> their<00:02:57.340> most

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
not saying there's Superman their most

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
not saying there's Superman their most
saying<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.239> mean<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.019> good<00:02:59.200> sign<00:02:59.470> or

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
saying I mean is that a good sign or

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.110 
saying I mean is that a good sign or
would<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.190> be<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.340> good<00:03:00.489> indication<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
would that be a good indication of a

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.600 
would that be a good indication of a
scientist<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.840> well<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:03.280> actually

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
scientist like you well so it actually

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.910 
scientist like you well so it actually
is<00:03:03.730> because<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.239> slightly<00:03:05.019> larger<00:03:05.260> planet<00:03:05.800> than

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
is because a slightly larger planet than

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.290 
is because a slightly larger planet than
Earth<00:03:06.010> means<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:06.910> more<00:03:07.120> active

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
Earth means that it's it's more active

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.210 
Earth means that it's it's more active
there's<00:03:07.720> actually<00:03:07.959> more<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.769> people<00:03:08.950> think

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
there's actually more if people think

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.710 
there's actually more if people think
that<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.519> volcanic<00:03:09.970> activity<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.420> what<00:03:10.570> got

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
that like volcanic activity is what got

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.150 
that like volcanic activity is what got
one<00:03:11.230> things<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.440> got<00:03:11.620> life<00:03:11.769> started<00:03:12.130> here

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
one things that got life started here

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.370 
one things that got life started here
since<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.760> planet<00:03:13.030> has<00:03:13.150> more<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.900> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
since a planet has more of that and a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.039 
since a planet has more of that and a
color<00:03:15.160> start<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.720> actually<00:03:16.810> has

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
color start and so it actually has

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.720 
color start and so it actually has
anything<00:03:17.799> that's<00:03:17.950> any<00:03:18.130> life<00:03:18.310> that's<00:03:18.549> there

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
anything that's any life that's there

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.670 
anything that's any life that's there
has<00:03:18.910> more<00:03:19.150> time<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.959> would<00:03:20.290> say<00:03:20.410> it's<00:03:20.590> a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
has more time to I would say it's a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.890 
has more time to I would say it's a
pretty<00:03:20.890> cool<00:03:21.100> planet<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:21.820> this<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:22.750> not

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
pretty cool planet so this is it's not

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.330 
pretty cool planet so this is it's not
it's<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.440> most<00:03:23.560> amazing<00:03:23.860> one<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.040> NASA<00:03:24.190> has

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
it's the most amazing one the NASA has

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.640 
it's the most amazing one the NASA has
found<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:24.670> far<00:03:24.820> called<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.120> Kepler<00:03:25.540> 22b<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:26.410> who

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
found so far called the Kepler 22b I who

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.900 
found so far called the Kepler 22b I who
knows<00:03:27.010> what<00:03:27.220> they're<00:03:27.310> going<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.489> see<00:03:27.670> next

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
knows what they're going to see next

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.210 
knows what they're going to see next
well<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.110> whate<00:03:29.290> yeah<00:03:29.739> we're

well this is on the whate yeah we're
halfway<00:03:30.400> through<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:31.390> Kepler<00:03:31.900> mission

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
halfway through this this Kepler mission

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.840 
halfway through this this Kepler mission
really<00:03:32.590> about<00:03:32.680> halfway<00:03:32.890> through<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.610> there's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
really about halfway through so there's
