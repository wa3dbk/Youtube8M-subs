00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
games I remember playing that she had a

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.350 
games I remember playing that she had a
story<00:06:04.259> so<00:06:05.069> there<00:06:05.279> was<00:06:05.460> basically<00:06:05.759> you<00:06:06.330> know

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
story so there was basically you know

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.570 
story so there was basically you know
like<00:06:06.599> pac-man<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:07.110> lot<00:06:07.349> of<00:06:07.500> single<00:06:07.949> screen<00:06:08.190> shot

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
like pac-man a lot of single screen shot

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.850 
like pac-man a lot of single screen shot
sounds<00:06:08.940> like<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.360> Galaga<00:06:09.930> and<00:06:10.229> tempeh<00:06:10.590> so<00:06:10.800> it

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
sounds like the Galaga and tempeh so it

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.990 
sounds like the Galaga and tempeh so it
really<00:06:10.979> was<00:06:11.159> no<00:06:11.310> beginning<00:06:11.520> middle<00:06:11.819> end

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
really was no beginning middle end

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240 
really was no beginning middle end
whereas<00:06:12.750> in<00:06:12.900> Donkey<00:06:13.169> Kong<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.830> had<00:06:14.009> basically

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
whereas in Donkey Kong you had basically

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.189 
whereas in Donkey Kong you had basically
a<00:06:14.460> story<00:06:14.759> or<00:06:15.000> your<00:06:15.180> Mario<00:06:15.539> there's<00:06:15.840> Donkey

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199

Kong and Duncan took Mario's lady and

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.300 
Kong and Duncan took Mario's lady and
basically<00:06:20.400> you<00:06:20.550> have<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.849> go<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:22.199> save<00:06:22.469> her<00:06:22.650> so
