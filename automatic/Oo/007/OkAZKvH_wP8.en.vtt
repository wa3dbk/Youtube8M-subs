game<00:00:39.320> I'm<00:00:39.879> cutting<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:40.969> in<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.090> matchup<00:00:41.270> boxes

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
game I'm cutting you in a matchup boxes

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.060 
game I'm cutting you in a matchup boxes
and<00:00:42.020> then<00:00:42.079> takes<00:00:42.289> them<00:00:42.410> away<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:42.770> have<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:42.950> get

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
and then takes them away you have to get

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.439 
and then takes them away you have to get
three<00:00:43.250> least<00:00:43.460> three<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.760> row<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.239> there's<00:00:44.390> a

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
three least three in a row so there's a

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.489 
three least three in a row so there's a
lot<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.600> different<00:00:44.690> levels<00:00:45.109> they<00:00:45.170> come<00:00:45.320> with

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
lot of different levels they come with

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.349 
lot of different levels they come with
lot<00:00:45.679> of<00:00:45.739> different<00:00:45.949> stages<00:00:46.159> so<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.269> is

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
lot of different stages so this is

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.910 
lot of different stages so this is
basically<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.749> first<00:00:47.929> level<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.679> gives<00:00:48.829> you

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
basically the first level it gives you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.380 
basically the first level it gives you
an<00:00:49.010> introduction<00:00:49.339> of<00:00:49.640> how<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:49.879> actually<00:00:50.149> work

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
an introduction of how to actually work

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.970 
an introduction of how to actually work
so<00:00:50.659> basically<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.079> move<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.319> boxes<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.829> they

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
so basically you move the boxes and they

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.369 
so basically you move the boxes and they
disappear<00:00:52.429> so<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.510> first<00:00:53.629> couple<00:00:53.870> levels<00:00:54.079> are

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
disappear so the first couple levels are

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.680 
disappear so the first couple levels are
pretty<00:00:54.710> easy<00:00:55.219> they're<00:00:55.699> basically<00:00:56.059> tutorial

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
pretty easy they're basically tutorial

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.329 
pretty easy they're basically tutorial
levels<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.079> tell<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:57.409> where<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.039> can<00:00:58.159> move

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
levels to tell you where you can move

00:00:58.339 --> 00:00:59.919 
levels to tell you where you can move
boxes<00:00:58.609> how<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:58.999> can<00:00:59.179> move<00:00:59.300> them<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.809> can

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
boxes how you can move them you can

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.119 
boxes how you can move them you can
switch<00:01:00.199> them<00:01:00.289> with<00:01:00.409> other<00:01:00.559> boxes<00:01:00.949> at<00:01:01.069> our

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
switch them with other boxes at our

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.189 
switch them with other boxes at our
rapist<00:01:01.370> item<00:01:01.760> for<00:01:02.539> example<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:02.929> this<00:01:03.019> level

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
rapist item for example in this level

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.810 
rapist item for example in this level
you<00:01:03.350> switch<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> two<00:01:03.859> boxes<00:01:04.040> side<00:01:04.430> by<00:01:04.580> side

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
you switch the two boxes side by side

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.060 
you switch the two boxes side by side
and<00:01:05.030> they<00:01:05.900> switch<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.710> then<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.890> Rose

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
and they switch and then the Rose

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.100 
and they switch and then the Rose
disappear<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.300> said<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:08.600> need<00:01:08.750> three<00:01:08.780> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.170 
four or five different kinds of boxes
I'm<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.860> one<00:01:25.010> there's<00:01:25.160> like<00:01:25.250> three<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:25.730> you

I'm this one there's like three and you
have<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.360> do<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.570> in<00:01:26.810> two<00:01:27.110> moves<00:01:27.610> there<00:01:28.610> are<00:01:28.820> a

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
have to do that in two moves there are a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.580 
have to do that in two moves there are a
lot<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.390> difficult<00:01:29.870> levels<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.260> will<00:01:30.410> say

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
lot of difficult levels I will say

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.740 
lot of difficult levels I will say
though<00:01:30.770> on<00:01:30.980> this<00:01:31.400> game<00:01:31.580> starts<00:01:31.880> out<00:01:32.000> easy<00:01:32.210> but

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
though on this game starts out easy but

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.230 
though on this game starts out easy but
it<00:01:32.840> gets<00:01:32.930> really<00:01:33.350> hard<00:01:33.620> i<00:01:33.800> sat<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.910> level<00:01:35.060> for

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
it gets really hard i sat on a level for

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.460 
it gets really hard i sat on a level for
like<00:01:35.360> 10<00:01:35.570> minutes<00:01:35.750> trying<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.050> figure<00:01:36.290> it<00:01:36.320> out

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
like 10 minutes trying to figure it out

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.440 
like 10 minutes trying to figure it out
so<00:01:37.010> I<00:01:37.040> think<00:01:37.160> some<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.550> them<00:01:37.730> are<00:01:37.880> pretty<00:01:38.150> hard

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
so I think some of them are pretty hard

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.480 
so I think some of them are pretty hard
but<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.050> have<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.200> mind<00:01:39.770> for<00:01:39.950> puzzles<00:01:40.370> and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
but if you have a mind for puzzles and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.610 
but if you have a mind for puzzles and
really<00:01:40.790> like<00:01:40.910> puzzle<00:01:41.240> games<00:01:41.270> i<00:01:41.660> would<00:01:42.440> suggest

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
really like puzzle games i would suggest

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.710 
really like puzzle games i would suggest
this<00:01:42.950> if<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.820> like<00:01:43.970> playing<00:01:44.210> games<00:01:44.300> that

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
this if you just like playing games that

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.690 
this if you just like playing games that
are<00:01:44.810> kind<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.140> mindless<00:01:45.470> i<00:01:45.740> wouldn't<00:01:46.610> suggest

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
are kind of mindless i wouldn't suggest

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.460 
are kind of mindless i wouldn't suggest
this<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.780> does<00:01:47.930> take<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.140> little<00:01:48.230> bit<00:01:48.380> of

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
this it does take a little bit of

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.050 
this it does take a little bit of
concentration<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.340> go<00:01:49.430> sit<00:01:49.850> there<00:01:49.970> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
concentration do it go sit there and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.480 
concentration do it go sit there and
think<00:01:50.120> out<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.570> for<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.780> while<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.110> see<00:01:51.490> what

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
think out of it for a while to see what

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.510 
think out of it for a while to see what
box<00:01:52.730> you<00:01:52.940> should<00:01:52.970> move<00:01:53.210> where<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.690> there<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.170> a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
box you should move where and there is a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.800 
box you should move where and there is a
back<00:01:55.520> button<00:01:55.820> if<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.180> make<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> move<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.660> don't

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
back button if you make a move you don't

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.330 
back button if you make a move you don't
like<00:01:56.990> for<00:01:57.260> example<00:01:57.320> there's<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.950> move<00:01:58.100> I

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
like for example there's that move I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.310 
like for example there's that move I
don't<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.580> them<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.840> hit<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.110> back

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
don't like them so I can hit this back

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.800 
don't like them so I can hit this back
button<00:02:00.590> right<00:02:00.710> here<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.040> go<00:02:01.160> back<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:02.210> like

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
button right here to go back and it like

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.270 
button right here to go back and it like
undos<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.260> move<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:03.800> get<00:02:03.920> back<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.190> your

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
undos a move so you get back to your

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.590 
undos a move so you get back to your
beginning<00:02:04.700> without<00:02:04.790> having<00:02:05.120> to<00:02:05.210> restart<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
beginning without having to restart the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.850 
beginning without having to restart the
whole<00:02:05.750> level<00:02:05.900> if<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.230> only<00:02:06.350> want<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.590> go<00:02:06.680> back

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
whole level if you only want to go back

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.660 
whole level if you only want to go back
one<00:02:07.100> move<00:02:07.479> um<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:09.080> different<00:02:09.830> stages<00:02:10.069> like

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
one move um in different stages like

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.890 
one move um in different stages like
this<00:02:10.819> is<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:10.940> new<00:02:11.090> stage<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.629> is<00:02:11.750> level

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
this is a new stage and this is level

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.690 
this is a new stage and this is level
one<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.769> goes<00:02:12.860> back<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> basics

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
one it kind of goes back to the basics

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.479 
one it kind of goes back to the basics
again<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.360> it's<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.050> one<00:02:15.319> move<00:02:15.560> takes<00:02:16.310> care

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
again and it's like one move takes care

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.160 
again and it's like one move takes care
of<00:02:16.519> all<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.760> them<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:18.019> get

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
of all of them so it's not like you get

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.020 
of all of them so it's not like you get
the<00:02:18.379> higher<00:02:18.590> moves<00:02:18.920> like<00:02:19.220> each<00:02:19.430> new<00:02:19.700> world

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the higher moves like each new world

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.700 
the higher moves like each new world
level<00:02:20.720> whatever<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.140> wanna<00:02:21.260> call<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.470> I'm

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
level whatever you wanna call it I'm

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.040 
level whatever you wanna call it I'm
back<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.550> one<00:02:22.730> move<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.569> are<00:02:23.720> harder

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
back to one move but they are harder

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.120 
back to one move but they are harder
levels<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.350> do<00:02:24.440> have<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.650> think<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.860> little<00:02:24.950> bit

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
levels you do have to think a little bit

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.470 
levels you do have to think a little bit
but

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
but

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
but
like<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.930> said<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.260> one<00:02:26.440> move<00:02:26.650> I'm<00:02:27.069> after<00:02:27.340> you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
like I said it's one move I'm after you

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.830 
like I said it's one move I'm after you
after<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.030> look<00:02:28.180> out<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> little<00:02:28.480> bit<00:02:28.659> you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
after you look out a little bit you

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360 
after you look out a little bit you
figure<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.170> out<00:02:29.290> as<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.069> see<00:02:30.220> i'm<00:02:30.340> not

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
figure it out as you can see i'm not

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.660 
figure it out as you can see i'm not
doing<00:02:30.700> very<00:02:30.730> good<00:02:30.970> right<00:02:31.120> now<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.480> i'm<00:02:32.670> good

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
doing very good right now and i'm good

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.460 
doing very good right now and i'm good
hopefully<00:02:34.120> eventually<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.019> but<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.349> can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
hopefully eventually get it but you can

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.170 
hopefully eventually get it but you can
see<00:02:35.680> i<00:02:35.920> keep<00:02:36.159> using<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.489> run<00:02:36.640> do<00:02:36.819> but<00:02:36.970> instead

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
see i keep using the run do but instead

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.970 
see i keep using the run do but instead
i<00:02:37.239> haven't<00:02:37.540> go<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.780> whole<00:02:37.959> way<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.140> restart

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
i haven't go the whole way and restart

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.280 
i haven't go the whole way and restart
the<00:02:39.099> whole<00:02:39.220> level<00:02:39.400> I'm<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.269> eventually<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:41.019> do

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the whole level I'm so eventually I do

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.440 
the whole level I'm so eventually I do
hope<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.910> there<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.269> see<00:02:43.360> I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
hope to get this and there you can see I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.300 
hope to get this and there you can see I
got<00:02:43.629> it<00:02:43.750> right<00:02:43.810> there<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.260> they<00:02:44.830> kind<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.099> fall

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
got it right there and they kind of fall

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.520 
got it right there and they kind of fall
you<00:02:46.120> do<00:02:46.299> want<00:02:46.510> moving<00:02:46.840> everything<00:02:47.319> that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you do want moving everything that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.559 
you do want moving everything that
happens<00:02:47.830> under<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.129> move<00:02:48.310> happens<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.510> as

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
happens under that move happens so as

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.119 
happens under that move happens so as
you<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.750> see<00:02:49.870> there<00:02:49.989> are<00:02:50.110> many<00:02:50.319> levels<00:02:50.560> you

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
you can see there are many levels you

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.369 
you can see there are many levels you
can<00:02:51.280> mute<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.819> mute<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.480> volume<00:02:52.840> from<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
can mute and I mute the volume from the

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.390 
can mute and I mute the volume from the
screen<00:02:53.620> there<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> got<00:02:54.370> a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
screen there and you can see I got a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.039 
screen there and you can see I got a
trophy<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.360> because<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.599> filled<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:55.989> all

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
trophy on that because I filled out all

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.559 
trophy on that because I filled out all
the<00:02:56.260> levels<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:56.980> Boston<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:57.970> can<00:02:58.060> see<00:02:58.269> this

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
the levels in Boston as you can see this

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.089 
the levels in Boston as you can see this
is<00:02:58.720> level<00:02:58.900> with<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.410> lot<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.709> different<00:02:59.920> kinds

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
is level with a lot of different kinds

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.289 
is level with a lot of different kinds
of<00:03:00.160> cases<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.640> there's<00:03:00.760> only<00:03:00.849> three<00:03:01.150> moves

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
of cases and there's only three moves

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.580 
of cases and there's only three moves
complete<00:03:01.750> all<00:03:01.870> these<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.170> might<00:03:02.290> think<00:03:02.440> well

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
complete all these you might think well

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430 
complete all these you might think well
it's<00:03:02.769> impossible<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.780> see<00:03:05.019> if

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
it's impossible but as you can see if

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.740 
it's impossible but as you can see if
you<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.769> move<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:06.069> couple<00:03:06.220> around<00:03:06.750> that

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
you just move a couple around that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.720 
you just move a couple around that
basically<00:03:08.200> almost<00:03:08.470> solves<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.160> them<00:03:09.400> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
basically almost solves all of them and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.940 
basically almost solves all of them and
then<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:09.940> move<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:10.359> more<00:03:10.629> it<00:03:11.319> solves<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
then you move one more it solves the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.670 
then you move one more it solves the
whole<00:03:12.069> puzzle<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.879> overall<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.959> would<00:03:14.109> say<00:03:14.349> this

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
whole puzzle so overall I would say this

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
whole puzzle so overall I would say this
is<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.859> fun<00:03:15.190> game<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:16.359> does<00:03:16.569> get<00:03:16.750> very

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
is a fun game but it does get very

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.599 
is a fun game but it does get very
frustrating<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:17.829> if<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.069> don't<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.400> being

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.890 
frustrating so if you don't like being
frustrated<00:03:19.060> with<00:03:19.150> puzzle<00:03:19.450> games<00:03:19.599> that<00:03:19.750> won't

very far but like I said difficulty can

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.629 
very far but like I said difficulty can
be<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> little<00:03:41.440> bit<00:03:41.650> over<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:42.130> top<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.609> my

opinion and what other people might
think<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.799> right<00:03:45.040> I'm<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.669> I<00:03:45.819> probably

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
think it's just right I'm it I probably

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.789 
think it's just right I'm it I probably
think<00:03:46.599> it's<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.870> good<00:03:46.989> workout<00:03:47.200> for<00:03:47.470> your<00:03:47.560> brain

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799

think it's a good workout for your brain
and<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.609> one<00:03:48.760> level<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.389> took<00:03:49.510> me

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
and this is one level that it took me

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.420 
and this is one level that it took me
forever<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.019> figure<00:03:50.200> out<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:51.130> padang<00:03:51.400> a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
forever to figure out and in padang a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.250 
forever to figure out and in padang a
waste<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.790> your<00:03:51.910> time<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.870> try<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.049> figure

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
waste of your time if you try to figure

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.620 
waste of your time if you try to figure
it<00:03:53.349> out<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:54.160> if<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.340> do<00:03:54.519> more<00:03:55.000> moves<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.389> says

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
it out but if you do more moves and says

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.390 
it out but if you do more moves and says
you<00:03:55.989> have<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.200> retry<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.650> can't<00:03:57.130> do<00:03:57.220> like

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
you have to retry you can't do like

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.250 
you have to retry you can't do like
three<00:03:57.669> moves<00:03:57.880> out<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.120> two<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.510> pass<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.049> level

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
three moves out of two and pass a level

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.680 
three moves out of two and pass a level
you<00:03:59.440> have<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.590> actually<00:03:59.769> retry<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.540> that's

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
you have to actually retry so that's

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.289 
you have to actually retry so that's
basically<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.169> easy<00:04:03.010> controls<00:04:03.519> but<00:04:03.849> there's

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
basically it easy controls but there's

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.400 
basically it easy controls but there's
some<00:04:04.419> pretty<00:04:04.540> hard<00:04:04.780> game<00:04:04.930> playing<00:04:05.169> the<00:04:05.290> higher
