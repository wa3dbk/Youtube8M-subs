00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.830 
little bit too much of a Nancy dive
coming<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.190> from<00:05:12.340> gravity<00:05:12.670> but<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:13.150> guys<00:05:13.600> that

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
coming in from gravity but the guys that

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.630 
coming in from gravity but the guys that
need<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.200> focus<00:05:14.410> I'm<00:05:14.740> focusing<00:05:15.190> with<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.430> team

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
need to focus I'm focusing with the team

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.920 
need to focus I'm focusing with the team
it<00:05:15.850> looks<00:05:16.000> like<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.240> went<00:05:16.360> out<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.630> see<00:05:16.780> if<00:05:16.810> you

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
it looks like you went out to see if you

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.240 
it looks like you went out to see if you
can<00:05:17.050> take<00:05:17.200> down<00:05:17.350> players<00:05:17.710> as<00:05:17.890> well<00:05:17.920> just

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
can take down players as well just

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.860 
can take down players as well just
outside<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.760> base<00:05:18.910> but<00:05:19.150> now<00:05:19.330> they're<00:05:19.540> back<00:05:19.660> on

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
outside the base but now they're back on

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.390 
outside the base but now they're back on
the<00:05:19.990> Nexus<00:05:20.350> turrets<00:05:20.740> it's<00:05:20.920> going<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.130> be<00:05:21.220> quite

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
the Nexus turrets it's going to be quite

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.520 
the Nexus turrets it's going to be quite
a<00:05:21.520> bit<00:05:21.730> of<00:05:21.820> time<00:05:22.000> here<00:05:22.030> for<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.900> spawn<00:05:23.200> of<00:05:23.230> the

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
a bit of time here for the spawn of the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.320 
a bit of time here for the spawn of the
rest<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.100> members<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.460> enemy<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.210> they

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
rest of the members of enemy and they

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.690 
rest of the members of enemy and they
will<00:05:25.570> be<00:05:25.810> on<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.080> ground<00:05:26.350> they<00:05:26.830> will<00:05:27.040> not<00:05:27.280> 20

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
will be on the ground they will not 20

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.970 
will be on the ground they will not 20

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
the 11 in the matchup and in 37 38

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.910 
the 11 in the matchup and in 37 38
minutes<00:05:34.180> on<00:05:34.420> the<00:05:34.510> clock<00:05:34.660> gravity<00:05:35.380> takes<00:05:35.680> down

minutes on the clock gravity takes down

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.610 
minutes on the clock gravity takes down
enemy<00:05:36.480> right<00:05:37.480> at<00:05:37.600> that<00:05:37.720> average<00:05:38.080> game<00:05:38.320> time

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
enemy right at that average game time

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.980 
enemy right at that average game time
got<00:05:39.460> imperfect<00:05:41.760> well<00:05:42.760> yeah<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.630> didn't<00:05:43.930> need

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
got imperfect well yeah that didn't need

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.870 
got imperfect well yeah that didn't need
the<00:05:44.140> home<00:05:44.260> wrecker<00:05:44.500> it's<00:05:44.950> no<00:05:45.190> proposed<00:05:45.610> though

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
the home wrecker it's no proposed though

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.480 
the home wrecker it's no proposed though
it's<00:05:46.660> still<00:05:46.900> proposed<00:05:47.350> yeah<00:05:47.830> they<00:05:48.100> came<00:05:48.280> in

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
it's still proposed yeah they came in

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.800 
it's still proposed yeah they came in
they<00:05:48.520> stuck<00:05:48.850> to<00:05:48.940> their<00:05:48.970> plan<00:05:49.270> we're<00:05:49.570> gonna<00:05:49.660> go

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
they stuck to their plan we're gonna go

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.630 
they stuck to their plan we're gonna go
five<00:05:50.020> dragons<00:05:50.350> if<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:51.010> will<00:05:51.250> end<00:05:51.430> it

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
five dragons if that will end it

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.820 
five dragons if that will end it
gathered<00:05:52.570> in<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:52.840> actually<00:05:53.020> get<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.500> fifth

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
gathered in and actually get the fifth

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.800 
gathered in and actually get the fifth
one<00:05:53.980> but<00:05:54.430> it<00:05:54.670> allowed<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.060> maghreb<00:05:55.360> baronet

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
one but it allowed the maghreb baronet

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.070 
one but it allowed the maghreb baronet
finish<00:05:56.080> off<00:05:56.230> the<00:05:56.350> game

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
finish off the game

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050 
finish off the game
and<00:05:58.289> a<00:05:58.560> lot<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.979> early<00:05:59.250> movement<00:05:59.639> in<00:05:59.939> the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
and a lot of early movement in the

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.939 
and a lot of early movement in the
jungle<00:06:00.509> coming<00:06:00.900> from<00:06:01.050> gravity<00:06:01.620> they<00:06:01.889> were

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
jungle coming from gravity they were

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.320 
jungle coming from gravity they were
mirrored<00:06:02.310> at<00:06:02.490> first<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:03.000> then<00:06:03.090> move

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
mirrored at first and then move

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.529 
mirrored at first and then move
continues<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:04.050> take<00:06:04.259> off<00:06:04.439> help<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:04.889> lanes<00:06:05.539> you

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
continues to take off help the lanes you

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.480 
continues to take off help the lanes you
get<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.930> pressure<00:06:07.199> or<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.530> gangs<00:06:07.860> necessary

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
get the pressure or the gangs necessary

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.689 
get the pressure or the gangs necessary
every<00:06:09.419> time<00:06:09.629> he<00:06:09.990> figures<00:06:10.949> out<00:06:11.099> a<00:06:11.159> way<00:06:11.280> to<00:06:11.430> do<00:06:11.610> it

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
every time he figures out a way to do it

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.580 
every time he figures out a way to do it
even<00:06:11.849> when<00:06:12.030> he<00:06:12.120> dies<00:06:12.330> still<00:06:13.050> is<00:06:13.169> able<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:13.469> be

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
even when he dies still is able to be

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.189 
even when he dies still is able to be
there<00:06:13.740> for<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.009> team
