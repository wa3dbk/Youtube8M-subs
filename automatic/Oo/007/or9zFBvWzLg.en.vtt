jared polin froknowsphoto.com here with
another<00:00:08.790> quick<00:00:09.090> tip<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.809> time<00:00:10.139> it's

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
another quick tip and this time it's

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.370 
another quick tip and this time it's
about<00:00:10.860> adding<00:00:11.250> motion<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.540> your<00:00:12.570> images<00:00:13.170> which

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
about adding motion to your images which

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.160 
about adding motion to your images which
adds<00:00:13.670> emotion<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.030> generally<00:00:15.599> speaking<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:16.049> lot

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
adds emotion so generally speaking a lot

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.950 
adds emotion so generally speaking a lot
of<00:00:16.320> people<00:00:16.560> try<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.740> freeze<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.850> action<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.720> an

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
of people try to freeze the action in an

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.720 
of people try to freeze the action in an
image<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:19.740> you're<00:00:19.830> shooting<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.279> subject

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
image but if you're shooting a subject

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.609 
image but if you're shooting a subject
where<00:00:20.880> motion<00:00:21.420> comes<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:21.960> play<00:00:22.170> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
where motion comes into play it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
where motion comes into play it's
sometimes<00:00:23.100> nice<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.580> capture<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> that

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
sometimes nice to capture some of that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.859 
sometimes nice to capture some of that
motion<00:00:25.400> going<00:00:26.400> through<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> image<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.539> what

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
motion going through this image so what

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
motion going through this image so what
we're<00:00:27.990> gonna<00:00:28.080> see<00:00:28.349> right<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.189> me<00:00:29.400> doing<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
we're gonna see right now is me doing it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150 
we're gonna see right now is me doing it
in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> real<00:00:30.420> world<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.560> exactly

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
in the real world so you can see exactly

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
in the real world so you can see exactly
how<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> set<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.270> camera<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.840> how<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
how to set your camera and how to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
how to set your camera and how to
capture<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.399> motion<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.690> image<00:00:44.360> there

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
capture that motion in the image there

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.430 
capture that motion in the image there
we<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.539> hopefully<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.930> get<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.230> motion

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
we go hopefully we get some motion

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
we go hopefully we get some motion
movement<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.789> may<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.149> happen<00:00:48.360> at

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
movement in there they may not happen at

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
movement in there they may not happen at
five<00:00:48.780> hundredth<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.350> second<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:51.680> yeah<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
five hundredth of a second but yeah so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.729 
five hundredth of a second but yeah so
sometimes<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.360> motion<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
sometimes you want to get motion in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.080 
sometimes you want to get motion in
order<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.219> me<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.820> about

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
order for me that I have to think about

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
order for me that I have to think about
this<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.899> him<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.039> on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this and to get him going like this on

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.740 
this and to get him going like this on
there<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> hand<00:01:00.059> moving<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.629> his

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
there to get the hand moving but his

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.700 
there to get the hand moving but his
face<00:01:00.989> still<00:01:01.949> I'm<00:01:02.430> gonna<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.500> lower<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
face still I'm gonna have to lower the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.399 
face still I'm gonna have to lower the
ISO<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.479> lower<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.110> shutter

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
ISO so that I can then lower my shutter

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.850 
ISO so that I can then lower my shutter
speed<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.210> slow<00:01:09.570> enough<00:01:09.869> being<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
speed to get it slow enough being that I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.320 
speed to get it slow enough being that I
have<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> VR<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.729> I'll<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.090> able<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
have the VR here I'll be able to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
have the VR here I'll be able to
stabilize<00:01:12.689> Joe<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.439> keep<00:01:13.590> him<00:01:13.799> still<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
stabilize Joe and keep him still but the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
stabilize Joe and keep him still but the
hand<00:01:14.909> should<00:01:15.180> blur<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.320> bit

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
hand should blur so that's a little bit

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.570 
hand should blur so that's a little bit
of<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> challenge<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:17.220> thinking<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of a challenge that I'm thinking of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
of a challenge that I'm thinking of
right<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.409> 1600

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
right here so I'm gonna go I'm at 1600

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.630 
right here so I'm gonna go I'm at 1600
ISO<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.700> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> drop<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> say<00:01:22.070> 1600<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> 800

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
ISO I want to drop it to say 1600 to 800

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
ISO I want to drop it to say 1600 to 800
is<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.880> stop<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.270> two<00:01:24.450> stops<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
is one stop and two stops would take it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.450 
is one stop and two stops would take it
to<00:01:25.320> 400<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.630> let's<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> 400<00:01:28.380> ISO<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> being

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
to 400 so let's go to 400 ISO and being

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.390 
to 400 so let's go to 400 ISO and being
I'm<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.420> 500th<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.229> second<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:32.100> stops

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I'm at one 500th of a second two stops

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.450 
I'm at one 500th of a second two stops
less<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.630> stop<00:01:33.869> less<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> 250th<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> then

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
less one stop less is 250th and then

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.300 
less one stop less is 250th and then
another<00:01:35.670> stop<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.270> 125th<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.740> let's<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.100> I'm

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
another stop is 125th so let's see I'm

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.450 
another stop is 125th so let's see I'm
gonna<00:01:38.640> take<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:38.939> shutter<00:01:39.180> speed<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> one

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
gonna take my shutter speed down to one

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
gonna take my shutter speed down to one
125th<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:42.509> gonna<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.290> get

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
125th and I'm gonna see if I can get

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
125th and I'm gonna see if I can get
that<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.220> work<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:44.759> hold<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.000> hold<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that to work all right hold it hold it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
that to work all right hold it hold it
go<00:01:45.540> ahead<00:01:47.630> boom<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.229> timed<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.860> into<00:01:50.579> such<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
go ahead boom and I timed it into such a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
go ahead boom and I timed it into such a
point<00:01:51.710> okay<00:01:52.710> okay<00:01:53.430> okay<00:01:54.060> okay<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.500> worked<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
point okay okay okay okay that worked it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.630 
point okay okay okay okay that worked it
worked

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
worked

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.190 
worked
Joe<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.000> frozen<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> hand

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
Joe is frozen and you got the hand

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.510 
Joe is frozen and you got the hand
coming<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> little<00:01:58.710> bit<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.430> is

coming down a little bit now this is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
coming down a little bit now this is
gonna<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.119> bit<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.450> work<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.930> get

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
gonna take a little bit of work to get

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.950 
gonna take a little bit of work to get
better<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.369> thinking<00:02:02.939> behind<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.570> was

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
better but the thinking behind it was

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.800 
better but the thinking behind it was
right<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> quick<00:02:05.549> tip<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.450> want<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
right so as a quick tip if you want to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.619 
right so as a quick tip if you want to
try<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.290> motion<00:02:07.770> into<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> shot

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
try to get some motion into the shot

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.580 
try to get some motion into the shot
you've<00:02:09.629> got<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> slow<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.289> shutter<00:02:10.530> speed

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
you've got to slow your shutter speed

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.530 
you've got to slow your shutter speed
down<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.489> means<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> drop<00:02:12.360> your

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
down which means you have to drop your

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.640 
down which means you have to drop your
ISO<00:02:13.050> which

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
ISO which

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
ISO which
then<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.189> also<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.519> good<00:02:14.700> idea<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> put<00:02:15.299> VR<00:02:15.720> on

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
then it's also a good idea to put VR on

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.990 
then it's also a good idea to put VR on
if<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.890> capability<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.549> Jo<00:02:17.849> would

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
if you have that capability so Jo would

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.119 
if you have that capability so Jo would
be<00:02:18.150> frozen<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.689> as<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.170> hand<00:02:19.439> is<00:02:19.620> coming<00:02:19.799> down

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
be frozen and as the hand is coming down

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.729 
be frozen and as the hand is coming down
on<00:02:20.189> top<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.909> dough<00:02:21.090> ball<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:22.170> hand<00:02:22.470> will

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
on top of the dough ball the hand will

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.800 
on top of the dough ball the hand will
blur<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.310> little<00:02:23.610> bit<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.030> did<00:02:24.299> at<00:02:24.450> 1:00<00:02:24.659> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
blur a little bit it did at 1:00 to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.020 
blur a little bit it did at 1:00 to
125th<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.799> second<00:02:26.189> it<00:02:26.340> would<00:02:26.610> go<00:02:26.819> even

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
125th of a second it would go even

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.569 
125th of a second it would go even
further<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.840> we<00:02:28.230> dropped<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> even<00:02:28.829> even<00:02:29.400> lower

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
further if we dropped it even even lower

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.699 
further if we dropped it even even lower
but<00:02:29.970> keep<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.329> mind<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.109> want<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.409> get

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
but keep in mind if you want to get

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.080 
but keep in mind if you want to get
something<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.099> little<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:32.370> blurry<00:02:32.790> some

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
something a little more blurry some

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.809 
something a little more blurry some
motion<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.930> add<00:02:34.079> some<00:02:34.560> emotion<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.489> image

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
motion to add some emotion to the image

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.929 
motion to add some emotion to the image
just<00:02:36.390> drop<00:02:37.319> your<00:02:37.470> iso<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.579> drop<00:02:38.760> it

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
just drop your iso so if you drop it

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.780 
just drop your iso so if you drop it
from<00:02:38.970> 1600<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.930> 400<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.250> that's<00:02:41.459> two

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
from 1600 to 400 know that that's two

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.429 
from 1600 to 400 know that that's two
stops<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.420> then<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.170> same

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
stops and then if you want the same

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.960 
stops and then if you want the same
exact<00:02:43.769> exposure<00:02:44.159> that's<00:02:44.430> been<00:02:44.549> working<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
exact exposure that's been working the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.759 
exact exposure that's been working the
whole<00:02:45.000> time<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.870> need<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.349> drop<00:02:46.590> your

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
whole time you need to just drop your

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.649 
whole time you need to just drop your
shutter<00:02:47.010> speed<00:02:47.099> two<00:02:47.819> stops<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.420> then

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
shutter speed two stops and then

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.839 
shutter speed two stops and then
everything<00:02:49.260> else<00:02:49.409> is<00:02:49.530> gonna<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.709> exactly<00:02:50.159> the

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
everything else is gonna be exactly the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.330 
everything else is gonna be exactly the
same<00:02:51.049> so<00:02:52.049> there<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.650> guys<00:02:52.889> that's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
same so there you have it guys that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.699 
same so there you have it guys that's
how<00:02:53.639> I<00:02:53.670> added<00:02:54.209> motion<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.109> image<00:02:55.379> which

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
how I added motion to the image which

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.830 
how I added motion to the image which
added<00:02:56.099> emotion<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.000> helped<00:02:57.269> tell<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.569> story

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
added emotion it helped tell the story

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.740 
added emotion it helped tell the story
so<00:02:58.260> much<00:02:58.470> better<00:02:58.739> seeing<00:02:59.040> Jo's<00:02:59.370> hand<00:02:59.700> move<00:03:00.120> but

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
so much better seeing Jo's hand move but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.720 
so much better seeing Jo's hand move but
seeing<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.260> blur<00:03:01.560> instead<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.189> freezing

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
seeing it blur instead of just freezing

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
seeing it blur instead of just freezing
it<00:03:02.849> because<00:03:03.239> if<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.659> freeze<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:03.959> it

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
it because if you just freeze it it

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.920 
it because if you just freeze it it
doesn't<00:03:04.859> add<00:03:05.010> any<00:03:05.250> dimension<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> image

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
doesn't add any dimension to the image

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.080 
doesn't add any dimension to the image
but<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.560> said<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.069> was<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.459> done<00:03:08.819> with

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
but like I said this was all done with
