thumbprint which is kind of kind of cool
but<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> thumbprint<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.989> never<00:01:04.199> match<00:01:08.090> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
but the thumbprint will never match and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.109 
but the thumbprint will never match and
the<00:01:09.240> arm<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.810> sound<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> gist<00:01:11.970> of
