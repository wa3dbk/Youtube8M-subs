high<00:03:42.820> standards<00:03:43.330> it's<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.510> performance

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
high standards it's a performance

culture you have to apply yourself and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.070 
culture you have to apply yourself and
and<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.180> guess<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.450> key<00:03:46.570> skill<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.870> knowing

and I guess the key skill is knowing

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.690 
and I guess the key skill is knowing
when<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.320> need<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.530> do<00:03:47.680> which<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.400> those<00:03:48.489> two

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
when you need to do which of those two

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.680 
when you need to do which of those two
things

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
things

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.180 
things
I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.270> with<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.410> know<00:03:53.530> with<00:03:54.010> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
I think that with the you know with the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.160 
I think that with the you know with the
amount<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.670> technology<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.360> most<00:03:55.750> people

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
amount of technology that most people

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.690 
amount of technology that most people
have<00:03:56.350> at<00:03:56.470> their<00:03:56.620> fingertips<00:03:56.650> these<00:03:57.280> days<00:03:57.520> you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
have at their fingertips these days you

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.160 
have at their fingertips these days you
know<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.820> can't<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.270> a<00:03:58.300> film<00:03:58.630> producer<00:03:59.050> you

actually<00:04:56.140> take<00:04:56.290> someone<00:04:56.560> out<00:04:56.590> not<00:04:57.310> because

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
actually take someone out not because

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.010
