00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.390 
J line I think they would have done
there<00:03:13.850> there<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> great<00:03:14.510> season<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.860> really

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
there there a great season it is really

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.040 
there there a great season it is really
difficult<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.940> think<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.269> second<00:03:17.660> season<00:03:17.840> in

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
difficult I think the second season in

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.660 
difficult I think the second season in
the<00:03:18.170> Premiership<00:03:18.680> they<00:03:18.830> always<00:03:19.160> say<00:03:19.459> about

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
the Premiership they always say about

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.340 
the Premiership they always say about
survival<00:03:20.390> in<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.600> first<00:03:20.840> one<00:03:21.080> but<00:03:21.200> they've

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
survival in the first one but they've

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.960 
survival in the first one but they've
done<00:03:21.560> there<00:03:21.800> but<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> second<00:03:22.459> season<00:03:22.610> can

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
done there but the second season can

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.990 
done there but the second season can
often<00:03:23.269> be<00:03:23.420> just<00:03:24.050> as<00:03:24.200> critical<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.700> honest

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
often be just as critical and in honest

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.229 
often be just as critical and in honest
I<00:03:26.150> pretty<00:03:26.510> well<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:28.100> our<00:03:28.250> decent<00:03:28.670> results<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
I pretty well of our decent results and
