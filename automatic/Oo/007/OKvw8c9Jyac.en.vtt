00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.500
 So for the first time I have this here 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.630
 Essens powder that is a transparent 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.920
 powder and therefore I believe just below 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 4 euro and I have already 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.649
 my blog written as I am 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.570

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.090
 It marks the whole day is for everyone 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 there I am that is transparent so that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 is a real top product then i have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 this one will make eyebrow money 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.660
 Bought 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 that is already my second as 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.190
 pretty handy with this nastiest one here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 above 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.850
 and yes, it is also transparent 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 But there are also dyed for real 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.010
 keeps brown and dark brown 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 then I have the cherry from essens 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.049
 blossom limited edition found and and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.420
 Of course I had to do the paper 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 buy lashes I do not remember 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 satisfy costume I believe two 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 or three euros about it is yes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.799
 new to the assortment come the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 essens multi action the black is lag 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.570
 the actually looks exactly like this from 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.829
 the brush gentleman like the pink but me 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.979
 Really must say I am very disappointed 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.570
 from the base, so to speak, the normal multi 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.530
 action the normal multi action here 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.380
 pink which is really good 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.049
 the geologists are very energetic and they 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.409
 can also be relatively good for three 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 euro mascara but with the purple with the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.940
 I'm not sure 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.830
 If I have the mascara I have 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.020
 first of all the feeling it is no 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.090
 Mask on my eyelashes on it there 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.890
 no sweeping the lashes the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.989
 just said two would work 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.239
 tons remain on it so well 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.170
 maybe very disappointed then I have 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.560
 I bought the volume again 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.260
 million extinction of Oscar this then 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.470
 absolute fan of me the political 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.670
 always in combination with the p2 what's 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.010
 up offers because of the p2 I wear 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.260
 the on the whole swing and that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.420
 to get volume and after their 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.040
 layer of the p2 mascara I go then 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.739
 with that you would get over from here 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.120
 to separate the eyelashes because I have 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.040
 yes in mascara comparison video 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 made and there you have seen that it 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 really extremely glued and therefore know 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.110
 I always have them with the mascara then 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.769
 I bought a normal one 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.220
 kajal of sms about 95 cents tasted 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:04.350
 then I have this eyebrow pencil 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.680
 bought by patrice in color think 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.110
 beautiful 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.840
 and yes so to the current with 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.190
 average, we now come to the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.829
 press pictures I was totally 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.410
 Initially by Wall Kraft Limited 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.269
 edition of essence because it really great 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.420
 colors are the ones that go well with me green 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.120
 purple and interested in the eyeshadow 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.530
 or in the holy brother but that 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.340
 I did not like it that much because 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.440
 So I could not do anything because I was 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.579
 I came a dm and they have one 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.410
 the thing not yet unpacked 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.940
 By chance, I have the karl 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 were standing there then asked if 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.150
 I can take a look 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.640
 can take something and the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.069
 hikers also so friendly and therefore 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:52.420
 I only have the three eyeshadows 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:04:00.670
 with just half of the time here and 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:10.239
 it looks like that then comes the green 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:12.099
 it and it looks like and the swatch 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.159
 is to all the things that you find 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.329
 by the way, on my blog 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.880
 yes because I do not have that now 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:27.970
 make extra and now comes the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:28.509
 third and so it looks like that's it 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.880
 now 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.620
 and now there are two more limited 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.500
 editions by patrice that is once 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.830
 similar to the fans limited edition the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.720
 But that means time and us as well 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.020
 There are earthy tones 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.539
 two quattros with pink-brown and 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.449
 green tones and nail polishes which are on neutral 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.919
 and are also gaudy 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.479
 but somehow I like that 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.210
 not from the element inter-stars me 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:06.580
 I have now bought a thing and 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:10.300
 I do not know what that's all for 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.330
 so and as the so - called lipstick the 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.190
 showing in the finish of a lipgloss house 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.740
 you have that one pretty much 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:28.090
 slight color release and a real 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:30.070
 Classics is so alone 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.259
 applied we were too dark 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.180
 I do not do not know why so 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.340
 already pretty bleached again 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.930
 I also wear it right now I have 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.090
 just my lips very small 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.770
 bit blunted with concealer and 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.050
 you have applied it in a 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.139
 only layer and so is real for me 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.599
 optimal so 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:52.699
 it is not too dark for me 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:59.029
 and so good to me and then I have as 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:06:02.060
 Lastly, the cut riester bought the 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:10.699
 Cube is said to be a benefit 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:14.229
 be and the top that looks like it 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:17.840
 reminds me strongly of the p2 at the 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.750
 open up girls or broader than I know 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.159
 not at all like also has one 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.969
 similar ones almost the same 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.319
 consistency and color delivery yes 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:32.870
 they actually differ only 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:36.379
 a blanket but with me are already real 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.479
 slipped off and yes that was it 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.740
 actually have it again 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.740
 then next time bye
