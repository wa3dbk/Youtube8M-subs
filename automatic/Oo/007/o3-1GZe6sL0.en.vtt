 also the drive to the place of employment was 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 very difficult the fog was on some 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.129

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.770
 busy annihilating the embers 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 to show the pictures from the day after the fire 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.580
 with what power the fire has raged 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799
 The buildings were used during the fire 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.700
 Part completely destroyed roofs are 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.700
 everything is burned in the flames for 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 be responsible for it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.140

 Over 300 times the fire department had to 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 move out this night 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.990
 Yes, New Year's Eve was back 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.750
 It was eventful yesterday during the day 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.520
 Quiet and after 0 o'clock it went 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.410
 suddenly we had already in 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.360
 the first quarter of an hour is equal to two 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.780
 district on the third floor 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.610
 roof fire that was quite extensive 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.680
 and many forces has tied over 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.080
 longer time and at the second alarm 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.350
 That was a malicious alert about 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.970
 push button detectors in a parking garage and 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.900
 of course, then one night 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.040
 where so much going on is really superfluous 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.500
 who the fire department just for fun 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 alarmed can even count on it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.980
 to go to prison 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.290
 the resulting costs incurred as eg 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.300
 the evacuation of a building, etc 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.550
