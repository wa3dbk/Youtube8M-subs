00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:05.680
 that is a truism of Germany motorists like it what the cars 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.209
 As far as luxury class is concerned, Liebert is somewhat conservative 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.049
 Year not too noticeable so outward to the new BMW 5 Series 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.150
 work high-tech and his straightforward won 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.070
 That too is a conservative side sedan of the Rover 75 from England 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:28.269
 constructed by BMW when Lover was still a daughter of the Bavarian manufacturer 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.180
 both test candidates are touring limousines 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.780
 That's why we have them not only in the state but also in short and long hauls 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.900
 Traffic tested extensively 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.370
 fits on the profile 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.870
 Countries are now facing the extreme trials 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 they are necessary for the final assessment of the two vehicles 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.400
 the slalom the new five has an active steering that is the servomotor 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.770
 is assisted by an additional mother who supports the rotation of the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.090
 Steering wheel Sachs has adjusted the pace 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.159
 and at the same time one to one put on the road 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.159
 a great thing for a thousand 200 euros extra 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.520
 only with Snow Painter servo assistance also our Rover creates the course with 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.340
 Bravery 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.320
 if not quite so sporty, however, could be the power steering here 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.899
 despite text Selenter feedback slightly less 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.870
 the circle class 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.880
 it starts with the acceleration to pace 80 when running straight is at 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 both without blame 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.620
 At the pylons, walk away from the gas and, at the same time, suggest a kind of turning 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.920
 in an extreme left-hander 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.300
 The 5 Series BMW reacts to the load change despite PSP initially with a hack 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.710
 but this is by jumping on the electronic help 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.290
 quickly and safely eliminates the vehicle back to the right one 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.560
 Trace returned 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.009
 the subsequently fastest possible round trip completed the Hecktriebler 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.130
 almost neutral 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.570
 without problems 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.090
 The same procedure with the tubes being first before reacts faster than that 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 at BMW 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.810
 for sporty riders braking too fast over the front wheels 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.180
 The Englishman decided to turn corners are also one 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.200
 tune immaculate suspension 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.069
 by Friedrich Stickler Schleich over taxes then completed the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.979
 fastest possible circle Forchheim train free 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.199
 the torture route 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.799
 Here is the 5 Series BMW litter 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.329
 really comfortable 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.359
 and the heavier the better the Bayer bounces over any bumps 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.069
 on the Lower spoiled his occupants with a very good suspension and 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.359
 Damping only at full load turned considerable body movements 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.659
 Prof 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.749
 the brake 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:38.659
 both have disc brakes Abts and brake booster full braking off 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.389
 Tempo 100 on stage entered 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.869
 the good result from about 30 meters in Heerenveen 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.169
 39 meters for the grandfather 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.909
 the Sprint both are about the same SchrÃ¤der Rover but seven horsepower 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:50.530
 stronger 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.319
 at the sprint from the stand on pace hundred therefore takes over the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.550
 Englishman with 88 points ahead of Bayern with ten Thomas Heise customers the top 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.939
 Dr 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.839
 the result in between sports from 60 to 100 in fourth gear 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.769
 new chamber two seconds compared to 10 chamber 8 seconds for the BMW 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:17.129
 the interior noise at tempo 100 62 DB a for the Englishman 59 DB a for 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.369
 the Bayern 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:19.950
 the maximum speed 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.169
 the Lower creates real 224 at the indicated 235 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.089
 the BMW 50 210 at 218 can be found on the approx 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.409
 the gas consumption 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.969
 the fraud was mostly fast test drive for the BMW 10 chamber 5 liters 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.389
 on a hundred kilometers 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.379
 that means a range of 670 kilometers with the 70 liter day 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.159
 and 10 chamber 8 liters or a range of 602 kilometers with 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.569
 the 65 liter tank of the Lohrer 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.589
 and finally the recommended retail price of the manufacturers of the BMW 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:58.969
 520i costs from 35 thousand 100 euros 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:05.589
 The Rover 75 train number 5 4 6 10 lets you get from 33 pauses 110
