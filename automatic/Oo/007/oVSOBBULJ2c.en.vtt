00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
think there's only there only have a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.200 
think there's only there only have a
sixth<00:04:26.190> all<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.520> which<00:04:26.699> would<00:04:26.849> be<00:04:27.000> one

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
sixth all of this which would be one

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.760 
sixth all of this which would be one
sixth<00:04:27.599> of<00:04:27.659> a<00:04:27.780> cake<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.229> you're<00:04:28.349> talking<00:04:28.500> about
