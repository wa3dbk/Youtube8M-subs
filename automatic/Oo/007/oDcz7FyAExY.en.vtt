detail<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.680> probably<00:02:02.040> explains<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
detail so that probably explains the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.310 
detail so that probably explains the
amount<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> crappy<00:02:03.390> repacked<00:02:03.810> you've<00:02:03.990> seen<00:02:04.170> in

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
amount of crappy repacked you've seen in

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.679 
amount of crappy repacked you've seen in
this<00:02:04.409> line<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.860> far

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
this line so far

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.800 
this line so far
there<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.079> an<00:02:07.979> accessory<00:02:08.489> there

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
there we go that's an accessory there

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.580 
there we go that's an accessory there
just<00:02:09.810> doesn't<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.200> serve<00:02:10.379> much<00:02:10.530> purpose

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just doesn't really serve much purpose

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.040 
just doesn't really serve much purpose
really<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.510> said<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> figure

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
really and but as I said the figure

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.150 
really and but as I said the figure
itself<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.709> very

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
itself is very

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.700 
itself is very
very<00:02:14.310> nice<00:02:14.490> I'm<00:02:14.820> very<00:02:15.090> impressed<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
very nice I'm very impressed with it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
only differences are that this one

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.630

the vintage collection variant does

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.740 
the vintage collection variant does
indeed<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.820> put<00:02:42.150> my<00:02:42.240> hand<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.720> I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
indeed have if I can put my hand on it I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.800 
indeed have if I can put my hand on it I
believe<00:02:43.050> I've<00:02:43.200> misplaced<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.800> there<00:02:44.690> yeah<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
believe I've misplaced it there yeah it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.230 
believe I've misplaced it there yeah it
looks<00:02:45.990> like<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.490> comes<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.880> a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
looks like I have but it comes with a a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.590 
looks like I have but it comes with a a
one<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> Jedi<00:02:49.140> comlinks<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.420> figure

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
one of the Jedi comlinks so this figure

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.770 
one of the Jedi comlinks so this figure
doesn't<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> further

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
doesn't have that but for the further

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.120 
doesn't have that but for the further
one<00:02:54.930> pound<00:02:55.170> difference<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.010> are

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
one pound difference that there are

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.160 
one pound difference that there are
between<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.150> movie<00:02:57.420> heroes<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.870> vintage

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
between the movie heroes and vintage

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.390 
between the movie heroes and vintage
figures<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.770> obviously<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> more

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
figures this is obviously the more

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.310 
figures this is obviously the more
budgeted<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.180> much<00:03:00.360> more<00:03:00.540> logical<00:03:00.690> option<00:03:01.200> to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
budgeted and much more logical option to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.040 
budgeted and much more logical option to
go<00:03:01.440> far<00:03:05.060> figure<00:03:06.060> itself<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.690> really<00:03:06.930> really

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
go far figure itself is really really

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.630 
go far figure itself is really really
nice<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.680> do<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.040> couple<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.370> complaints

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
nice I do have a couple of complaints

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.200 
nice I do have a couple of complaints
about<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.770> but<00:03:10.770> they're<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.460> too<00:03:11.850> major

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
about it there but they're not too major

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.450 
about it there but they're not too major
the<00:03:12.780> first<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.170> which<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> fact<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
the first of which is the fact that the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.820 
the first of which is the fact that the
Jedi<00:03:14.760> braid<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.390> very<00:03:15.720> thick<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.200> very<00:03:16.620> very

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
Jedi braid is very thick and very very

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.680 
Jedi braid is very thick and very very
long<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.910> kind<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.150> looks<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.360> little<00:03:18.420> bit

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
long and it kind of looks a little bit

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.380 
long and it kind of looks a little bit
out<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.810> place<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:21.000> other<00:03:21.150> than<00:03:21.330> that

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
out of place and but other than that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.020 
out of place and but other than that
this<00:03:21.720> figure<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.140> practically<00:03:22.860> flawless<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
this figure is practically flawless the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.640 
this figure is practically flawless the
head<00:03:24.180> sculpt<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.630> reasonable<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.500> not

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
head sculpt is reasonable it's not

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
head sculpt is reasonable it's not
spectacular<00:03:26.040> I'll<00:03:26.610> bang<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.300> it's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
spectacular I'll bang on but it's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.840 
spectacular I'll bang on but it's
certainly<00:03:28.320> getting<00:03:28.560> there<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.250> nose<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.820> a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
certainly getting there the nose is a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.620 
certainly getting there the nose is a
little<00:03:29.940> bit<00:03:30.300> too<00:03:30.420> big<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.870> think

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
little bit too big that I think

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.490 
little bit too big that I think
obviously<00:03:33.630> he<00:03:33.720> comes<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:34.080> his<00:03:34.110> Jedi

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
obviously he comes with his Jedi

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.380 
obviously he comes with his Jedi
lightsaber<00:03:34.800> which<00:03:35.520> I've<00:03:35.670> actually<00:03:35.850> swapped

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
lightsaber which I've actually swapped

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.290 
lightsaber which I've actually swapped
out<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.200> case<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.880> lightsaber<00:03:39.240> that

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
out in this case and the lightsaber that

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.910 
out in this case and the lightsaber that
he<00:03:39.450> came<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.930> didn't<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.530> these<00:03:40.650> black

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
he came with didn't have these black

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.230 
he came with didn't have these black
highlights<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.550> on<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.700> top<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> hill

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
highlights and on the top of the hill

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.660 
highlights and on the top of the hill
and<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.440> last<00:03:43.650> area<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.070> actually<00:03:44.220> from

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
and so this last area is actually from

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.640 
and so this last area is actually from
the<00:03:44.730> vintage<00:03:45.450> collection<00:03:45.870> attack<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.440> clone

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the vintage collection attack the clone

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.070 
the vintage collection attack the clone
