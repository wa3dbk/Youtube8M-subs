00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.680
 look at the eiffel tower 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 go guys do not you realize 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.340
 but all the gauge whitened thanks to 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.299
 buildings rely on pigs 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:24.400
 I'm not here, you put yourself on the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:30.279
 side the other side so be careful when 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:39.510
 not even very clever in the ass now 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:39.510
 you jump crack is on the run 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.890
 how he feels the killer are one 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.680
 and chocolate drinks 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.489
 he gains strength so you are happy 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.809
 at least 2 of this morning's intro is ok 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.129
 to be good but here it is taf 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.420
 in addition I make you do the same thing 5 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.379
 x and o I'm pretty sophisticated 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.180
 okay we were great I think to 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:11.950
 many with a chocolate mc2 that in 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.950
 do everything it's gone 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 but part before ranking gently 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.479
 gently from an assassin 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.479
 me it's you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 Alas 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 I miss you ok we go there why not 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.450
 do you want to announce a little faster 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.590
 no progress 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.819
 we 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.440
 for a little momentum takes a little bit more 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.440
 momentum 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.239
 it's good in time 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.549
 wait for cars between a car 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.349
 just waiting for a kart people a little 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.349
 before the time to save his skin 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.720
 we left go 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.070
 frankly 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.890
 this is actually going to run here that's it and 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.000
 a suicidal mode if he's going to make a dirty 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.740
 tap over sarthe 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.090
 good then fell back here maybe 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.130
 to fuck the mouth on the floor it can be 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.520
 a PhD student roughly above I start 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:39.640
 and then you run and good luck 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:42.330
 it's good this assassin's break creed 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.330
 babouche more 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.190
 top 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.880
 these gas vouchers 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.970
 okay I tell you that the course 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.250
 pay and it pays well 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.470
 it's small, it's ok, it's fatima 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.900
 notch in the bone but we can 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.280
 continue ben it's not here 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.489
 operates sugar is good it does not matter 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.489
 Let's go 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:37.180
 zeego I was doing what 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.250
 refresh you do not need that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.160
 not so I did very well 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.699
 This is fine when and events 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.699
