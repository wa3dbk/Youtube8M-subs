00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.010 
through gas trapped in a glass tube the
shock<00:00:16.770> gets<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> gas<00:00:17.460> excited<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.330> that's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
shock gets the gas excited and that's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
shock gets the gas excited and that's
what<00:00:19.260> creates<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> intense<00:00:20.160> light<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.699> flash

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

number of windings in each coil more

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.800 
number of windings in each coil more
