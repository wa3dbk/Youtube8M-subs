00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.389
 proactive evidence seen a freeway 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.440
 It's called that first thought it is 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.350
 for children 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 hello first good morning nice that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.670
 one tells oneself in Austria freeway 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.350
 Do not prevent more for free 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 It is not special for kids that is 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.420
 It does it for adults 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.410
 names all honor it clears the way 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 and I can the product 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.739
 a chair that is configured 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 with very small wheels lead interior 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.430
 when I'm out and about 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.750
 Cobblestone would be then 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 I with this chair with these little ones 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.309
 Wheels have a problem I need 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 my freeway and have different 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 Advantages of the wheelchair only drives 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 little on three big wheels 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 rolling resistance no problems 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.360
 gravel or cobblestone 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.100
 I have a decent bike brake 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.070
 I have a sensible handlebar 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.409
 I can run it downhill properly 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 wheelchair run really fast 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.630
 can brake safely certainly not steer 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.250
 flapping or steering wheels the front wheels 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 even now are also here 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.659
 that probably raised the big one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.030
 advantage on larger circumference in front clear 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.500
 knowledge was of course great 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 Of course you want a few, too 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.960
 already recorded yourself 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 Of course, you can test a bit outside 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.330
 okay then i would just say there 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.799
 we do not need to lead that left 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.960
 not only looks cool, we have it 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.360
