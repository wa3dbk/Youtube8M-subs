00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
video I'll actually probably post a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.190 
video I'll actually probably post a
source<00:00:56.580> code<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.050> last<00:00:58.290> video<00:00:58.820> on<00:00:59.870> my<00:01:00.870> on

source code in the last video on my on
my<00:01:01.260> website<00:01:01.800> there'll<00:01:02.040> be<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> source<00:01:02.520> code

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
my website there'll be the source code

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
my website there'll be the source code
to<00:01:02.970> this<00:01:03.150> or<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.229> download<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.799> and

to this or you can download it and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
to this or you can download it and
analyze<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:05.909> use<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:07.259> apps<00:01:07.590> um<00:01:09.229> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
analyze it and use it in your apps um so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.679 
analyze it and use it in your apps um so
yeah<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.369> let's<00:01:11.909> start<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> top<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
yeah so let's start from the top and

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
yeah so let's start from the top and
we'll<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.170> down<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.640> did<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.060> touches

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
we'll go down here we did some touches

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.290 
we'll go down here we did some touches
pecans<00:01:15.899> touches<00:01:16.590> moved<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.940> start<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
pecans touches moved and we start the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.630 
pecans touches moved and we start the
game<00:01:18.510> loop<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.560> might<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:19.860> scary<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.250> trust

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
game loop it might look scary but trust

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
game loop it might look scary but trust
me<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:22.050> us<00:01:22.460> some<00:01:23.720> telling<00:01:24.720> where<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
me and some us some telling where the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.700 
me and some us some telling where the
computer<00:01:25.920> pedal<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.510> but<00:01:27.510> I'll<00:01:27.690> I'll<00:01:28.350> explain

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
computer pedal is but I'll I'll explain

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.170 
computer pedal is but I'll I'll explain
it<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.159> later<00:01:29.690> so<00:01:30.690> what<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> fun<00:01:31.500> these<00:01:32.180> we're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it all later so what a fun these we're

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.930 
it all later so what a fun these we're
defining<00:01:33.450> some<00:01:33.750> things<00:01:34.280> they're<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
defining some things they're kind of

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.820 
defining some things they're kind of
like<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.870> like<00:01:36.990> variable<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.590> kind

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
like the kind of like variable is kind

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.039 
like the kind of like variable is kind
of<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.950> placeholders<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.640> things<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
of like placeholders for things and it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.310 
of like placeholders for things and it
makes<00:01:40.200> things<00:01:40.409> easier<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.250> control<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
makes things easier to control this is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
makes things easier to control this is
like<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> control<00:01:44.010> panel<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> game<00:01:44.760> kind

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
like the control panel of the game kind

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.620 
like the control panel of the game kind
of<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:47.010> this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> easy<00:01:47.640> enough<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> understand

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
of so this is easy enough to understand

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.600 
of so this is easy enough to understand
this<00:01:49.260> is<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> game<00:01:49.799> state<00:01:50.040> running<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.490> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this is the game state running and this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.310 
this is the game state running and this
is<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.909> games<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.299> paused<00:01:51.630> um<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.720> we

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is the games they paused um this is we

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
is the games they paused um this is we
can<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.580> statement<00:01:57.030> down

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
can we use this in the if statement down

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
can we use this in the if statement down
here<00:01:57.510> if<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.409> game<00:01:58.590> states<00:01:58.830> running<00:01:59.220> blah

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
here if the game states running blah

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.480 
here if the game states running blah
blah<00:01:59.610> blah<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> game<00:02:00.450> States<00:02:00.720> paused<00:02:01.490> then

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
blah blah if the game States paused then

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.170 
blah blah if the game States paused then
display<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.090> message<00:02:03.570> or<00:02:03.840> whatever<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
display this message or whatever so and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.169 
display this message or whatever so and
then<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.479> define<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.990> capo<00:02:07.380> speed<00:02:07.650> X&amp;Y<00:02:08.179> since

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
then we define the capo speed X&amp;Y since

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.820 
then we define the capo speed X&amp;Y since
things<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> iphone<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.170> work<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.530> an<00:02:10.649> x

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
things on the iphone will work in an x

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.390 
things on the iphone will work in an x
and<00:02:10.979> y<00:02:11.159> axis<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.659> need<00:02:12.930> both<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> can

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and y axis you need both and you can

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
and y axis you need both and you can
manipulate<00:02:14.549> these<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.230> basically<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:16.830> is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
manipulate these so basically this is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.729 
manipulate these so basically this is
paul<00:02:17.280> speed<00:02:17.610> obviously<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.319> higher<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
paul speed obviously and the higher the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.339 
paul speed obviously and the higher the
number<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.069> put<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.359> faster<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.200> ball

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
number you put here the faster the ball

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.330 
number you put here the faster the ball
goes<00:02:22.590> those

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
goes those

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.089 
goes those
lower<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.450> slower<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.930> could<00:02:26.230> manipulate<00:02:26.650> it

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
lower the slower you could manipulate it

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.780 
lower the slower you could manipulate it
from<00:02:28.230> from<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.879> for<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.660> view<00:02:31.959> did<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> super

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
from from the for the view did the super

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.880 
from from the for the view did the super

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
viewdidload when we're going to do the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.009 
viewdidload when we're going to do the
end<00:02:36.129> when<00:02:36.670> we<00:02:36.819> were<00:02:36.910> using<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.330> timer<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.780> make

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
end when we were using the timer to make

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.650 
end when we were using the timer to make
the<00:02:38.140> golf<00:02:38.430> ball<00:02:39.430> kill<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.239> might<00:02:40.450> seem<00:02:40.629> a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the golf ball kill that might seem a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.070 
the golf ball kill that might seem a
little<00:02:40.840> bit<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.290> vague<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.810> this

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
little bit and vague but this is this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.500 
little bit and vague but this is this
makes<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.410> easy<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.860> control<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.120> highland

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
makes it easy to control so the highland

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.940 
makes it easy to control so the highland
number<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> faster<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.349> low<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.560> slowed

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
number the faster and the low is slowed

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.009 
number the faster and the low is slowed
so<00:02:48.730> if<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.910> wanted<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.209> put<00:02:49.360> different<00:02:49.660> levels

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
so if you wanted to put different levels

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.920 
so if you wanted to put different levels
you<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.260> put<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.799> higher<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you can put it like higher and the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.890 
you can put it like higher and the
computer<00:02:53.500> move<00:02:53.709> speed<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.220> how<00:02:54.340> fast<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
computer move speed so how fast the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.479 
computer move speed so how fast the
computer<00:02:55.900> paddles<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.530> there's<00:02:57.310> more

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
computer paddles so there's more

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.420 
computer paddles so there's more
advanced<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:59.079> here<00:02:59.290> again<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.160> higher

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
advanced and then here again the higher

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.130 
advanced and then here again the higher
the<00:03:00.670> faster<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.239> lower<00:03:01.360> slower<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the faster the lower slower and the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.089 
the faster the lower slower and the
sport<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.500> win<00:03:02.680> that's<00:03:02.920> pretty

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
sport of win that's pretty

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.180 
sport of win that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:03.720> five<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:05.049> five<00:03:05.410> thousand

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
self-explanatory five or five thousand

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
did the ibf convert back so you can go

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.890 
did the ibf convert back so you can go

back to calm screen to make multiple

back to calm screen to make multiple
ones<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.560> these<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.180> i<00:03:34.180> have<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:34.450> tutorial<00:03:34.870> on

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
ones of these and i have it tutorial on

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.289 
ones of these and i have it tutorial on
this<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:36.160> might<00:03:36.340> want<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.579> pause<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.120> your

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
this you might want to pause it to your

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.490 
this you might want to pause it to your
right<00:03:37.450> down<00:03:38.549> going<00:03:39.549> down<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
right down going down this is the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.440 
right down going down this is the
touches<00:03:41.829> began<00:03:42.190> when<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:42.970> touch<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.420> screen

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
touches began when you touch the screen

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.470 
touches began when you touch the screen
and<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.250> be<00:03:45.549> tapped<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:45.970> start<00:03:46.239> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
and it will be tapped to start and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.589 
and it will be tapped to start and
you'll<00:03:47.290> tap<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:47.889> then<00:03:48.400> we'll<00:03:48.579> start<00:03:48.849> so

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
you'll tap it and then we'll start so

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.210 
you'll tap it and then we'll start so
basically<00:03:50.019> you're<00:03:50.139> doing<00:03:50.410> an<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.980> statement

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
basically you're doing an if statement

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.530 
basically you're doing an if statement
here<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.599> we're<00:03:52.840> doing<00:03:52.930> game<00:03:53.440> state<00:03:54.389> equal<00:03:55.389> 0

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
here and we're doing game state equal 0

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.860 
here and we're doing game state equal 0
basically<00:03:56.380> what<00:03:57.010> this<00:03:57.160> says<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.849> when<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
basically what this says is when the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.159 
basically what this says is when the
games<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.530> running<00:04:00.459> tap<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.599> start<00:04:01.930> is

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
games it is running tap the start is

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:08.180 
games it is running tap the start is
hidden<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.299> if<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:04.569> if<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.650> game<00:04:05.859> state<00:04:07.169> is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
hidden and if it's if the game state is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.199 
hidden and if it's if the game state is
pause<00:04:09.190> then<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.700> shows<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.620> if<00:04:11.700> if<00:04:12.700> it's

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
pause then it shows and if if it's

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.140 
pause then it shows and if if it's
running<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:14.620> goes<00:04:14.889> away<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.489> you're<00:04:15.639> allowed

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
running it goes away and you're allowed

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.020 
running it goes away and you're allowed
to<00:04:16.660> move<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.739> paddle<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:19.440> here<00:04:20.440> we<00:04:21.400> move<00:04:21.609> this

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
to move the paddle and here we move this

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.390 
to move the paddle and here we move this
is<00:04:22.210> where<00:04:22.389> we're<00:04:22.740> saying<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:24.099> move<00:04:24.250> the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
is where we're saying we can move the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.089 
is where we're saying we can move the
paddle<00:04:24.760> but<00:04:25.360> we<00:04:25.720> were<00:04:26.229> saying<00:04:26.470> we<00:04:26.710> can't<00:04:26.950> move

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
paddle but we were saying we can't move

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.610 
paddle but we were saying we can't move
both<00:04:27.400> just<00:04:27.849> one<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.690> could<00:04:28.930> do<00:04:29.080> too<00:04:29.380> if<00:04:29.530> you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
both just one you could do too if you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.570 
both just one you could do too if you
wanted<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:30.010> make<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.310> multiplayer<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:32.580> since

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
wanted to make it multiplayer and since

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.950 
wanted to make it multiplayer and since
the<00:04:34.150> x<00:04:34.419> axis<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.349> on<00:04:36.570> landscape<00:04:37.570> and

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
the x axis is on landscape and

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.420 
the x axis is on landscape and
why<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> goes<00:04:38.380> up<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.740> down<00:04:38.800> if<00:04:39.130> you've<00:04:39.310> ever

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
why I goes up and down if you've ever

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.520 
why I goes up and down if you've ever
done<00:04:39.699> algebra<00:04:40.180> you'll<00:04:40.389> notice<00:04:40.780> um<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.750> made

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
done algebra you'll notice um so I made

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.040 
done algebra you'll notice um so I made
it<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:45.160> can<00:04:45.310> only<00:04:45.430> make<00:04:45.699> it<00:04:45.759> go<00:04:46.060> side

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
it so that you can only make it go side

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.529 
it so that you can only make it go side
side<00:04:47.319> but<00:04:47.770> actually<00:04:48.009> I<00:04:48.370> feel<00:04:48.699> have<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.240> should

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
side but actually I feel have I should

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.879 
side but actually I feel have I should
have<00:04:49.630> made<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:50.849> just<00:04:51.849> drag<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.360> anywhere<00:04:52.889> we

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
have made it just drag it anywhere we

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.740 
have made it just drag it anywhere we
could<00:04:54.069> just<00:04:54.400> take<00:04:54.610> took<00:04:55.090> off<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.419> exit

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
could just take took off the exit

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.730 
could just take took off the exit
location<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.970> you<00:04:58.750> would<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.380> able<00:04:59.620> to

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
location and you would like be able to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.370 
location and you would like be able to
drag<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.069> anywhere<00:05:00.310> but<00:05:00.849> then<00:05:01.229> you<00:05:02.229> would<00:05:02.349> have

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
drag it anywhere but then you would have

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.710 
drag it anywhere but then you would have
to<00:05:02.530> define<00:05:03.009> that<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.849> couldn't<00:05:04.120> go<00:05:04.330> farther

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
to define that it couldn't go farther

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.300 
to define that it couldn't go farther
than<00:05:04.930> half<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.560> screen<00:05:06.449> so<00:05:07.449> yeah<00:05:08.310> this

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
than half the screen so yeah this

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.370 
than half the screen so yeah this
is--okay<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.849> way<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.060> is<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:10.570> here<00:05:11.110> we<00:05:11.139> did

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
is--okay the way it is so here we did

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.800 
is--okay the way it is so here we did
the<00:05:11.500> touches<00:05:11.830> moved<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:13.000> attach<00:05:13.449> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
the touches moved you attach the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.320 
the touches moved you attach the
location<00:05:14.590> of<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.800> touch<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.400> was<00:05:15.970> saying<00:05:16.180> we

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
location of the touch I was saying we

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.159 
location of the touch I was saying we
can<00:05:16.509> do<00:05:17.080> I'll<00:05:17.500> move<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:17.949> on<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.130> x-axis<00:05:19.169> going

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
can do I'll move it on the x-axis going

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.640 
can do I'll move it on the x-axis going
down<00:05:20.410> here<00:05:20.889> we<00:05:21.099> start<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.430> game<00:05:21.580> loop<00:05:22.650> so

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
down here we start the game loop so

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.499 
down here we start the game loop so
basically<00:05:23.949> we're<00:05:24.130> defining<00:05:24.400> how<00:05:25.030> far<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
basically we're defining how far the

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.800 
basically we're defining how far the
ball<00:05:25.660> can<00:05:25.930> go<00:05:25.960> within<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.860> screen<00:05:27.389> here<00:05:28.389> we<00:05:28.690> do

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
ball can go within the screen here we do

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.909 
ball can go within the screen here we do
it<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.139> ball<00:05:29.320> that<00:05:29.650> Center<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.250> um<00:05:30.900> in<00:05:31.919> city

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
it the ball that Center is um in city

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.550 
it the ball that Center is um in city
call<00:05:33.159> this<00:05:33.280> I'm<00:05:33.849> sorry<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:35.520> greater<00:05:36.659> then<00:05:37.659> self

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
call this I'm sorry is greater then self

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.800 
call this I'm sorry is greater then self
the<00:05:39.250> view<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.729> bouncy<00:05:40.120> starts<00:05:40.389> of<00:05:40.479> with<00:05:40.509> the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
the view the bouncy starts of with the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.499 
the view the bouncy starts of with the
size<00:05:41.020> of<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.259> screen<00:05:41.380> then<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.490> then<00:05:43.449> it

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
size of the screen then it then it

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.469 
size of the screen then it then it
bounces<00:05:43.990> off<00:05:44.229> basically<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:45.039> it<00:05:45.159> and<00:05:45.400> then<00:05:46.360> we

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
bounces off basically and it and then we

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.159 
bounces off basically and it and then we
do<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.750> for<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:46.960> y<00:05:47.199> axis<00:05:47.949> as<00:05:48.130> well<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:49.169> here

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
do it for the y axis as well and here

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.939 
do it for the y axis as well and here
we're<00:05:50.800> doing<00:05:51.070> if<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.520> ball<00:05:52.169> intersects<00:05:53.169> the

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
we're doing if the ball intersects the

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.219 
we're doing if the ball intersects the
player<00:05:54.820> paddle<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.509> computer<00:05:55.930> paddle

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
player paddle and the computer paddle

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.219 
player paddle and the computer paddle
basically<00:05:57.190> we're<00:05:57.370> saying<00:05:57.699> is<00:05:58.030> once<00:05:59.020> it

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
basically we're saying is once it

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.939 
basically we're saying is once it
intersects<00:05:59.740> it<00:05:59.919> it<00:06:00.099> bounces<00:06:00.669> off<00:06:01.530> is<00:06:02.530> less

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
intersects it it bounces off is less

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.310 
intersects it it bounces off is less
than<00:06:03.219> and<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:05.440> block<00:06:05.770> minus<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.580> velocity

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
than and the block minus the velocity

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.570 
than and the block minus the velocity
silivasi<00:06:08.320> owes<00:06:08.800> and<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:11.050> bounces<00:06:11.500> off<00:06:11.710> so<00:06:12.340> I'm

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
silivasi owes and it bounces off so I'm

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.040 
silivasi owes and it bounces off so I'm
not<00:06:12.699> going<00:06:12.820> to<00:06:12.880> get<00:06:13.030> into<00:06:13.180> too<00:06:13.449> much<00:06:13.570> detail

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
not going to get into too much detail

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:22.200 
not going to get into too much detail
here<00:06:17.880> we<00:06:18.880> do<00:06:19.060> arm<00:06:20.460> basically<00:06:21.460> we're<00:06:21.909> doing

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
here we do arm basically we're doing

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.830 
here we do arm basically we're doing
we're<00:06:22.930> saying<00:06:23.280> that<00:06:24.280> the<00:06:24.759> computer<00:06:25.389> the

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
we're saying that the computer the

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.249 
we're saying that the computer the
computer<00:06:25.990> paddle<00:06:26.880> can<00:06:27.880> be<00:06:28.180> affected<00:06:28.960> by<00:06:29.199> the

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
computer paddle can be affected by the

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.450 
computer paddle can be affected by the
computer<00:06:30.009> move<00:06:30.250> speed<00:06:30.610> and<00:06:31.500> here<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:33.130> take<00:06:33.400> it

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
computer move speed and here you take it

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.029 
computer move speed and here you take it
you<00:06:34.180> were<00:06:34.539> doing<00:06:34.810> minus<00:06:35.229> the<00:06:35.409> computers<00:06:35.830> move

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
you were doing minus the computers move

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:41.279 
you were doing minus the computers move
speed<00:06:36.310> 0<00:06:38.639> and<00:06:39.639> here<00:06:40.360> we<00:06:40.419> are<00:06:40.509> doing<00:06:40.630> plus<00:06:41.110> the

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
speed 0 and here we are doing plus the

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.730 
speed 0 and here we are doing plus the
computer<00:06:41.680> move<00:06:41.860> speed<00:06:42.690> but<00:06:43.690> so<00:06:44.259> basically

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
computer move speed but so basically

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.779 
computer move speed but so basically
we're<00:06:45.520> doing<00:06:45.880> that<00:06:46.599> it's<00:06:46.900> it's<00:06:47.469> it<00:06:48.070> the

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
we're doing that it's it's it the

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.330 
we're doing that it's it's it the
computer<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.930> computer<00:06:50.050> paddle

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
computer the computer paddle

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.939 
computer the computer paddle
moving<00:06:51.699> on<00:06:51.820> the<00:06:51.940> eggs<00:06:52.120> execution<00:06:53.080> to<00:06:53.320> and<00:06:53.650> here

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
moving on the eggs execution to and here

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.000 
moving on the eggs execution to and here
we're<00:06:54.639> saying<00:06:54.910> we<00:06:55.090> can<00:06:55.300> add<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:56.500> move<00:06:56.710> speed

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
we're saying we can add the move speed

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.909 
we're saying we can add the move speed
to<00:06:57.280> it<00:06:57.780> so<00:06:58.780> I<00:06:58.810> hope<00:06:59.080> you<00:06:59.230> can<00:06:59.380> understand<00:06:59.919> that

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
to it so I hope you can understand that

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
feedback kissin which lets me make

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.290 
feedback kissin which lets me make
better<00:07:22.780> videos<00:07:23.050> I<00:07:23.820> think<00:07:24.820> it's<00:07:24.910> better<00:07:25.060> if<00:07:25.150> I

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
better videos I think it's better if I

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.120 
better videos I think it's better if I
don't<00:07:25.330> because<00:07:25.960> it<00:07:26.080> just<00:07:26.169> takes<00:07:26.440> too<00:07:26.590> long<00:07:26.620> and

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
don't because it just takes too long and

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
don't because it just takes too long and
it<00:07:27.310> makes<00:07:27.430> the<00:07:27.550> video<00:07:27.760> kind<00:07:28.060> of<00:07:28.180> boring<00:07:30.150> so

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
it makes the video kind of boring so

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.719 
it makes the video kind of boring so
let's<00:07:31.180> let<00:07:31.540> this<00:07:31.690> load<00:07:31.960> up<00:07:32.250> well<00:07:33.250> I<00:07:33.280> think<00:07:33.460> the

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:33.729 
let's let this load up well I think the

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.550 
let's let this load up well I think the
best<00:07:33.940> way<00:07:34.090> to<00:07:34.210> learn<00:07:34.419> is<00:07:34.479> analyzing<00:07:35.410> it

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
best way to learn is analyzing it

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.230 
best way to learn is analyzing it
personally<00:07:36.810> so<00:07:37.810> start<00:07:38.470> to<00:07:38.620> play<00:07:38.740> prom<00:07:39.240> click

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 
personally so start to play prom click

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.570 
personally so start to play prom click
click<00:07:40.540> start<00:07:40.930> nothing<00:07:41.860> really<00:07:41.950> works<00:07:42.280> because

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
click start nothing really works because

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.210 
click start nothing really works because
we<00:07:42.729> have<00:07:42.880> an<00:07:43.030> initialized<00:07:43.660> timer<00:07:44.080> we<00:07:44.919> can<00:07:45.130> go

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
we have an initialized timer we can go

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.629 
we have an initialized timer we can go
back<00:07:45.430> start<00:07:46.150> but<00:07:47.110> we<00:07:47.260> can<00:07:47.590> move<00:07:47.860> this<00:07:48.100> see

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 
back start but we can move this see

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.640 
back start but we can move this see
can't<00:07:49.300> move<00:07:49.449> it<00:07:49.600> up<00:07:49.690> and<00:07:49.810> down<00:07:49.870> but<00:07:50.289> we<00:07:50.410> can't

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:50.650 
can't move it up and down but we can't

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:56.100 
can't move it up and down but we can't
move<00:07:50.770> this<00:07:50.979> side<00:07:51.580> side<00:07:52.570> and<00:07:54.630> so<00:07:55.630> the<00:07:55.780> Metro
