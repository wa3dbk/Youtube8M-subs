00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
notes very simple it's going to start on

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.660 
notes very simple it's going to start on
E<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.020> just<00:00:36.710> start<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:36.980> know<00:00:37.100> this<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.489> middle

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
E and just start you know this is middle

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.180 
E and just start you know this is middle
C<00:00:37.940> here<00:00:39.310> so<00:00:40.310> it's<00:00:40.400> going<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.550> start<00:00:40.850> on<00:00:40.970> E<00:00:42.190> that

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
C here so it's going to start on E that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.890 
C here so it's going to start on E that
it's<00:00:43.340> going<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.489> go<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.670> f-sharp<00:00:45.220> then<00:00:46.220> e<00:00:46.489> flat

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.189 

then<00:00:50.900> E<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:52.449> then<00:00:53.449> that's<00:00:53.690> just<00:00:53.930> going<00:00:54.110> to

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
then E and then that's just going to

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.870 
then E and then that's just going to
repeat

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.170 

like<00:01:03.880> that<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> that's<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.710> left<00:01:05.890> hand<00:01:06.180> right

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
like that so that's the left hand right

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.230 
like that so that's the left hand right
so<00:01:07.510> this<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.110> right<00:01:08.290> hand<00:01:08.640> now<00:01:09.640> usually

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
so this is the right hand now usually

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.820
