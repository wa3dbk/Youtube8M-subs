generally having some problems of a
transformer<00:00:21.749> Prime<00:00:22.019> and<00:00:22.169> you<00:00:22.259> think<00:00:22.470> just

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:22.739 
transformer Prime and you think just

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.259 
transformer Prime and you think just
turning<00:00:23.069> it<00:00:23.159> off<00:00:23.249> and<00:00:23.460> turning<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.849> back<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.179> is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
turning it off and turning it back on is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.669 
turning it off and turning it back on is
not<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.599> resolve<00:00:24.839> it<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.589> is

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
not going to resolve it there is

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.259 
not going to resolve it there is
something<00:00:26.159> called<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.429> hard<00:00:26.669> reset<00:00:27.119> which

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

the second thing you need to do is press
two<00:00:49.620> buttons<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:50.670> boot-up<00:00:51.090> you'll<00:00:51.750> need<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
two buttons on boot-up you'll need to

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.620 
two buttons on boot-up you'll need to
press<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.440> power<00:00:52.650> button<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.580> also<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
press the power button here and also the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.870 
press the power button here and also the
volume<00:00:55.079> button<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.310> same<00:00:56.550> time

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
volume button it down at the same time

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.760

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
essentially when you're holding it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.600 
essentially when you're holding it
that's<00:01:01.380> going<00:01:01.560> to<00:01:01.620> trigger<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.950> different<00:01:02.220> type

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
that's going to trigger a different type

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.210 
that's going to trigger a different type
of<00:01:02.640> boot<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.210> when<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
of boot and when you know it's going to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.859 
of boot and when you know it's going to
boot<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.790> text<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.270> come<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> top

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
boot some text will come up in the top

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.169 
boot some text will come up in the top
left<00:01:07.170> hand<00:01:07.320> corner<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:08.069> when<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> boost<00:01:09.030> I

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
left hand corner here when I boost I

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.880 
left hand corner here when I boost I
will<00:01:09.359> now<00:01:09.479> demonstrate<00:01:09.719> and<00:01:10.319> hopefully<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
will now demonstrate and hopefully this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.529 
will now demonstrate and hopefully this
will<00:01:10.920> work<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.729> hold<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.999> power<00:01:12.210> button<00:01:12.509> and

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
will work so hold the power button and

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.590 
will work so hold the power button and
volume<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:13.109> at<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.350> same<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:14.329> which<00:01:15.329> I'm<00:01:15.479> now

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
volume up at the same time which I'm now

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.929 
volume up at the same time which I'm now
doing<00:01:15.659> I've<00:01:16.170> felt<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.039> it's<00:01:17.189> Rumble<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
doing I've felt that it's Rumble so it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.309 
doing I've felt that it's Rumble so it
is<00:01:18.060> booting<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.749> are<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.079> you<00:01:22.289> can

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
is booting up so there we are as you can

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.889 
is booting up so there we are as you can
see<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:23.159> text<00:01:23.520> came<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.359> top<00:01:24.719> left

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
see the text came up in the top left

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:25.999 
see the text came up in the top left
hand<00:01:25.020> corner<00:01:25.109> which<00:01:25.499> shows<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.920> going

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
hand corner which shows that it's going

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.319

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
to go to a different boot screen and

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.940 
to go to a different boot screen and
this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.569> a<00:01:27.600> different<00:01:27.960> boot<00:01:28.109> screen<00:01:28.380> two
