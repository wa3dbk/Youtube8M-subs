00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
notes in second but as I stand up I kind

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.840 
notes in second but as I stand up I kind
of<00:01:46.440> liked<00:01:47.440> in<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.710> pie<00:01:47.890> mute<00:01:48.100> until<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.700> get

more<00:01:49.000> more<00:01:49.539> cleaner<00:01:49.780> notes<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.560> it's<00:01:50.649> kind<00:01:50.800> of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
more more cleaner notes so it's kind of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.650 
more more cleaner notes so it's kind of
building<00:01:51.220> up<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.580> end<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.910> lake<00:01:52.030> but

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
that frost bit starts with the hammer

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.389 
that frost bit starts with the hammer
from<00:01:54.580> five<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.000> seven<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.420> B<00:01:55.539> string<00:01:56.399> and
