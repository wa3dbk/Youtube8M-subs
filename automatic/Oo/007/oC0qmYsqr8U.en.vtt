00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
series my review is simply that I liked

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.330 
series my review is simply that I liked
it<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.449> guess<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.019> liked<00:00:25.199> most<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> for

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
it well I guess I liked most of it for

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.779 
it well I guess I liked most of it for
me<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> show<00:00:26.970> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.300> took<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.599> turn<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
me the show kind of took a turn that

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.830 
me the show kind of took a turn that
almost<00:00:29.789> ruined<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.660> me

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
almost ruined it for me

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840 
almost ruined it for me
it<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.470> tough<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.489> knew<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.730> was

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it was tough because I knew it was

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.000 
it was tough because I knew it was
coming<00:00:33.210> because<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> entire<00:00:34.440> series<00:00:34.829> was

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
coming because the entire series was

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.549 
coming because the entire series was
building<00:00:35.489> towards<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:37.110> wasn't<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.530> if

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
building towards it so it wasn't as if

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.430 
building towards it so it wasn't as if
it<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.090> surprising<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.270> random<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it was surprising or random it was just

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619 
it was surprising or random it was just
dissatisfying<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.820> show<00:00:42.000> has<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> great<00:00:42.420> cast

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
dissatisfying the show has a great cast

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
dissatisfying the show has a great cast
of<00:00:42.780> characters<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:44.010> realistically

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
of characters that are realistically

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.990 
of characters that are realistically
flawed<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:46.140> likable<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> sympathetic

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
flawed but likable and sympathetic

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240 
flawed but likable and sympathetic
dramatic<00:00:48.930> tension<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> execution<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> done

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
dramatic tension and execution is done

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.779 
dramatic tension and execution is done
really<00:00:50.579> well<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.210> throughout<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:53.250> feel

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
really well all throughout and I feel

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.600 
really well all throughout and I feel
like<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.629> atmosphere<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.770> true<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
like the atmosphere is really true and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
like the atmosphere is really true and
honest<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.780> every<00:00:57.989> darkness<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
honest just about every darkness of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
honest just about every darkness of
humanity<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.520> explored<00:01:00.329> creating<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> show

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
humanity is explored creating a show

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.759 
humanity is explored creating a show
that's<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.770> dark<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> severe<00:01:03.750> even<00:01:04.650> though

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that's very dark and severe even though

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
that's very dark and severe even though
we<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.970> watered<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
we know it's pretty watered down in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.260 
we know it's pretty watered down in
comparison<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.950> source<00:01:08.369> material<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
comparison to the source material and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
comparison to the source material and
all<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.630> stuff<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.380> liked<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
all of that stuff I really liked and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.090 
all of that stuff I really liked and
because<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.240> liked<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> exploration<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> human

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
because I liked the exploration of human

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.340 
because I liked the exploration of human
evilness<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.450> why<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> didn't

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
evilness I think that's why I didn't

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740 
evilness I think that's why I didn't
like<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.830> turn<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> end<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.060> can't<00:01:18.570> say

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
like the turn at the end I can't say

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
like the turn at the end I can't say
that<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> better<00:01:19.740> ending<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.369> mind<00:01:20.759> but

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that I have a better ending in mind but

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.890 
that I have a better ending in mind but
I<00:01:22.009> have<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.310> say<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> feel<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I have to say that I feel like the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.760 
I have to say that I feel like the
finale<00:01:25.640> misrepresented<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> felt<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
finale misrepresented what I felt or the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
finale misrepresented what I felt or the
strengths<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> show<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.659> feel<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.020> I'm

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
strengths of the show I do feel like I'm

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.640 
strengths of the show I do feel like I'm
gonna<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> lot<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:33.079> disagreement<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.320> my

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
gonna get a lot of disagreement about my

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
gonna get a lot of disagreement about my
opinion<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.500> do<00:01:37.500> believe<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.939> show

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
opinion but I do believe that the show

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
opinion but I do believe that the show
is<00:01:39.689> worth<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.140> watch<00:01:40.350> despite<00:01:41.280> my

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
is worth a watch despite my

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
is worth a watch despite my
disappointment<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.780> ending<00:01:43.170> somehow<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
disappointment with the ending somehow I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
disappointment with the ending somehow I
doubt<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.520> many<00:01:44.610> anime<00:01:45.119> fans<00:01:45.420> who

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
doubt that there are many anime fans who

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280 
doubt that there are many anime fans who
don't<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:47.340> least<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.270> show<00:01:48.570> but

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
don't at least know about this show but

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
don't at least know about this show but
if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> haven't<00:01:49.950> seen<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.909> recommend

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
if you haven't seen it then I recommend

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
if you haven't seen it then I recommend
giving<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> look<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
giving it a look and now for the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.800 
giving it a look and now for the
spoilers<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
spoilers so if you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 
spoilers so if you
haven't<00:01:54.990> seen<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.610> go<00:01:56.610> away<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.360> thing

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
haven't seen it then go away the thing

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.880 
haven't seen it then go away the thing
that<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.810> trying<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> say<00:01:58.259> about<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> ending

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that I'm trying to say about the ending

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.560 
that I'm trying to say about the ending
is<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.340> made<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.670> feel<00:01:59.850> like<00:01:59.909> everything

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
is that it made me feel like everything

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.780 
is that it made me feel like everything
else<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.930> entire<00:02:01.049> series<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.860> pointless

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
else in the entire series was pointless

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
else in the entire series was pointless
I<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:03.930> were<00:02:04.020> trying<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> make<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I get that they were trying to make it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
I get that they were trying to make it
so<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:04.920> Griffith<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.970> going<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
so that Griffith was going up up up and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.359 
so that Griffith was going up up up and
then<00:02:07.289> they<00:02:07.409> took<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.009> from

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
then they took it all out from

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.040 
then they took it all out from
underneath<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.880> because<00:02:09.209> he<00:02:09.390> lost<00:02:09.630> her<00:02:09.840> guts

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
underneath him because he lost her guts

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.809 
underneath him because he lost her guts
but<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.679> much<00:02:10.830> time<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.160> dedicated<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
but so much time was dedicated to the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.680 
but so much time was dedicated to the
details<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.780> Griffiths<00:02:13.410> ascension<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.310> know

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
details of Griffiths ascension you know

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.080 
details of Griffiths ascension you know
assassinations<00:02:15.690> princess<00:02:16.380> wooing<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.160> all

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
assassinations princess wooing and all

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.839 
assassinations princess wooing and all
the<00:02:18.330> poisoning<00:02:19.080> scares<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.640> left

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the poisoning scares but I'm just left

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.729 
the poisoning scares but I'm just left
looking<00:02:21.150> back<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:22.170> why<00:02:22.470> did<00:02:22.650> I

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
looking back at that going why did I

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.100 
looking back at that going why did I
invest<00:02:23.130> all<00:02:23.370> my<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:23.910> into<00:02:24.180> those<00:02:24.420> subplots

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
invest all my time into those subplots

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
invest all my time into those subplots
and<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.860> not<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.099> Griffith<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.519> like

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and it's not just Griffith but like

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.000 
and it's not just Griffith but like
literally<00:02:27.330> everyone<00:02:28.049> in<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> entire<00:02:28.350> show

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
literally everyone in the entire show

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500 
literally everyone in the entire show
because<00:02:29.310> everyone<00:02:29.610> either<00:02:29.730> died<00:02:30.060> or<00:02:30.390> got

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
because everyone either died or got

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.840 
because everyone either died or got
absolutely<00:02:31.019> no<00:02:31.200> wrap<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:32.100> most<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.610> them

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
absolutely no wrap up but most of them

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.759 
absolutely no wrap up but most of them
died<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:33.930> frustrating<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.650> watch

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
died and it was frustrating to watch

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.559 
died and it was frustrating to watch
them<00:02:35.040> die<00:02:35.190> because<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.640> knew<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:36.180> were<00:02:36.239> going

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
them die because I knew they were going

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.270 
them die because I knew they were going
to<00:02:36.690> die<00:02:36.840> from<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.200> very<00:02:37.470> beginning<00:02:38.010> but

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
to die from the very beginning but

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.150 
to die from the very beginning but
watching<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.299> happen<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.290> left<00:02:40.709> me<00:02:40.830> with

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
watching it happen kind of left me with

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.520 
watching it happen kind of left me with
this<00:02:41.660> empty<00:02:42.660> feeling<00:02:43.290> inside<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:45.080> guess<00:02:46.080> maybe

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
this empty feeling inside I guess maybe

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.220 
this empty feeling inside I guess maybe
that<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.340> point<00:02:47.640> ultimately<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:49.019> show

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that was the point ultimately the show

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.750 
that was the point ultimately the show
was<00:02:49.380> supposed<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.769> be<00:02:49.890> guts<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.250> story<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
was supposed to be guts the story and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.190 
was supposed to be guts the story and
this<00:02:50.880> does<00:02:51.120> happen<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.540> people<00:02:51.750> occasionally

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this does happen to people occasionally

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.550 
this does happen to people occasionally
guts<00:02:53.010> started<00:02:53.549> out<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.849> shit<00:02:54.299> life<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
guts started out with a shit life and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.500 
guts started out with a shit life and
everything<00:02:55.980> eventually<00:02:56.220> got<00:02:56.700> better<00:02:56.910> he

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
everything eventually got better he

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.050 
everything eventually got better he
found<00:02:57.750> where<00:02:57.900> he<00:02:58.019> belonged<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.799> purpose<00:02:59.400> best

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
found where he belonged a purpose best

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.530 
found where he belonged a purpose best
friend<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.900> lover<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.010> even<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.370> dream<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.420> in

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
friend a lover and even a dream and in

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.030 
friend a lover and even a dream and in
the<00:03:03.660> end<00:03:03.780> all<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:03.989> was<00:03:04.290> taken<00:03:04.410> away<00:03:04.620> from<00:03:04.739> him

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the end all that was taken away from him

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.160 
the end all that was taken away from him
not<00:03:05.250> through<00:03:05.640> any<00:03:05.730> fault<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.120> his<00:03:06.269> own<00:03:06.420> but

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
not through any fault of his own but

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.890 
not through any fault of his own but
through<00:03:07.440> very<00:03:08.010> extenuating<00:03:08.970> circumstances

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
through very extenuating circumstances

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.590 
through very extenuating circumstances
and<00:03:10.380> now<00:03:10.470> he's<00:03:10.620> back<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:11.069> his<00:03:11.190> shit<00:03:11.489> life<00:03:11.790> but

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
and now he's back to his shit life but

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.180 
and now he's back to his shit life but
it's<00:03:12.720> even<00:03:13.049> worse<00:03:13.260> than<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.799> was<00:03:13.980> before

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
it's even worse than it was before

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.340 
it's even worse than it was before
because<00:03:14.640> now<00:03:14.880> he<00:03:15.209> knows<00:03:15.450> what<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.109> like<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
because now he knows what it's like to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.220 
because now he knows what it's like to
live<00:03:16.739> well<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.519> let's<00:03:17.850> face<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.090> after<00:03:18.780> what

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
live well and let's face it after what

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.840 
live well and let's face it after what
happened<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.650> him<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.190> everyone<00:03:20.370> who<00:03:20.549> cares

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
happened to him and everyone who cares

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.030 
happened to him and everyone who cares
about<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.780> pretty<00:03:22.109> unlikely<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.890> he's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
about it's pretty unlikely that he's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.199 
about it's pretty unlikely that he's
gonna<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.400> able<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.639> turn<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:24.180> around

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
gonna be able to turn it all around

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.930 
gonna be able to turn it all around
again<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.200> emptiness<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.220> was<00:03:26.489> left<00:03:26.700> with

again the emptiness that I was left with

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.930 
again the emptiness that I was left with
at<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.359> end<00:03:27.569> was<00:03:27.930> there<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:29.130> could<00:03:29.700> see

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
that it would be that much more

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.469 
that it would be that much more
difficult<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:47.080> see<00:05:47.320> everyone<00:05:48.220> fall<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.910> always

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
difficult to see everyone fall I always

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.420 
difficult to see everyone fall I always
wondered<00:05:50.020> why<00:05:50.289> that<00:05:50.320> first<00:05:50.800> episode<00:05:51.400> of

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
wondered why that first episode of

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.750 
wondered why that first episode of
bezerk<00:05:52.120> was<00:05:52.449> at<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.169> beginning<00:05:53.620> because<00:05:54.460> it

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
bezerk was at the beginning because it

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.790 
bezerk was at the beginning because it
was<00:05:54.970> kind<00:05:55.240> of<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.419> spoiler<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:56.289> let<00:05:56.440> us<00:05:56.590> know

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
was kind of a spoiler to let us know

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.339 
was kind of a spoiler to let us know
that<00:05:57.070> Griffiths<00:05:58.030> going<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.389> become<00:05:58.630> evil<00:05:59.080> and

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
that Griffiths going to become evil and

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:00.870 
that Griffiths going to become evil and
everyone<00:05:59.949> in<00:06:00.039> the<00:06:00.130> band<00:06:00.310> of<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.460> hawk<00:06:00.639> is

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
everyone in the band of the hawk is

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.939 
everyone in the band of the hawk is
going<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.180> die<00:06:01.360> but<00:06:01.900> if<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.199> had<00:06:02.320> been<00:06:02.470> episode

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
going to die but if it had been episode

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.650 
going to die but if it had been episode
25<00:06:03.490> then<00:06:03.760> I<00:06:03.789> feel<00:06:04.060> like<00:06:04.240> it<00:06:04.419> would<00:06:04.570> have

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
25 then I feel like it would have

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.300 
25 then I feel like it would have
brought<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.020> series<00:06:05.349> some<00:06:05.740> degree<00:06:06.160> of

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
brought the series some degree of

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.029 
brought the series some degree of
closure<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.900> it<00:06:08.410> would<00:06:08.530> almost<00:06:08.680> be<00:06:09.010> like

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
closure and it would almost be like

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.670 
closure and it would almost be like
things<00:06:09.610> are<00:06:09.789> looking<00:06:09.820> up<00:06:10.240> for<00:06:10.300> guts<00:06:10.690> leaving

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
things are looking up for guts leaving

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.440 
things are looking up for guts leaving
it<00:06:11.800> off<00:06:11.949> so<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.370> looks<00:06:12.700> kind<00:06:13.030> of<00:06:13.240> like<00:06:13.300> a

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
it off so it looks kind of like a

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.500 
it off so it looks kind of like a
cliffhanger<00:06:13.900> for

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
cliffhanger for

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.360 
cliffhanger for
second<00:06:14.930> season<00:06:15.290> even<00:06:15.800> though<00:06:15.950> there<00:06:16.280> will

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
second season even though there will

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.730 
second season even though there will
never<00:06:16.550> be<00:06:16.670> a<00:06:16.880> second<00:06:17.420> season<00:06:17.570> was<00:06:18.290> actually

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
never be a second season was actually

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.160 
never be a second season was actually
very<00:06:19.040> effective<00:06:19.370> also<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.420> ending<00:06:20.750> came<00:06:21.020> as<00:06:21.140> a

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
very effective also the ending came as a

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.020 
very effective also the ending came as a
terrible<00:06:21.440> shock<00:06:21.980> to<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.280> system<00:06:22.490> because<00:06:23.000> of

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
terrible shock to the system because of

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.210 
terrible shock to the system because of
the<00:06:23.150> sheer<00:06:23.450> brutality<00:06:24.020> of<00:06:24.320> it<00:06:24.560> all<00:06:24.710> knowing

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
the sheer brutality of it all knowing

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.040 
the sheer brutality of it all knowing
that<00:06:25.490> everyone<00:06:25.790> was<00:06:26.330> going<00:06:26.540> to<00:06:26.630> die<00:06:26.810> was

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
that everyone was going to die was

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.410 
that everyone was going to die was
almost<00:06:27.350> comforting<00:06:27.920> and<00:06:28.580> made<00:06:28.820> it<00:06:29.000> more

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
almost comforting and made it more

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.320 
almost comforting and made it more
bearable<00:06:29.810> to<00:06:30.140> watch<00:06:30.500> in<00:06:30.980> my<00:06:31.190> opinion<00:06:31.580> if<00:06:32.030> I<00:06:32.210> had

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
bearable to watch in my opinion if I had

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.420 
bearable to watch in my opinion if I had
gone<00:06:32.480> into<00:06:32.690> it<00:06:32.900> not<00:06:33.050> knowing<00:06:33.110> that<00:06:33.740> none<00:06:34.280> of

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
gone into it not knowing that none of

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.010 
gone into it not knowing that none of
the<00:06:34.550> characters<00:06:35.000> were<00:06:35.300> gonna<00:06:35.480> make<00:06:35.690> it<00:06:35.840> out<00:06:35.990> of

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
the characters were gonna make it out of

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.650 
the characters were gonna make it out of
there<00:06:36.320> then<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.070> think<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:37.700> would<00:06:37.970> have<00:06:38.060> had<00:06:38.300> a

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
there then I think I would have had a

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.780 
there then I think I would have had a
very<00:06:39.170> difficult<00:06:39.440> time<00:06:39.740> so<00:06:40.220> I<00:06:40.280> guess<00:06:40.460> in<00:06:40.670> the

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
very difficult time so I guess in the

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.210 
very difficult time so I guess in the
end<00:06:40.940> the<00:06:41.540> Cirque<00:06:41.750> is<00:06:41.930> a<00:06:42.050> surprisingly<00:06:42.800> smart

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
end the Cirque is a surprisingly smart

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.300 
end the Cirque is a surprisingly smart
show<00:06:43.550> at<00:06:44.060> a<00:06:44.120> glance<00:06:44.360> it<00:06:44.960> looks<00:06:45.230> like<00:06:45.320> mindless

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
show at a glance it looks like mindless

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.210 
show at a glance it looks like mindless
killing<00:06:47.090> and<00:06:47.420> rampaging<00:06:48.170> as<00:06:48.260> a<00:06:48.290> guy<00:06:48.560> with<00:06:48.800> huge

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
killing and rampaging as a guy with huge

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.450 
killing and rampaging as a guy with huge
muscles<00:06:49.760> swings<00:06:50.330> his<00:06:50.630> giant<00:06:51.140> sword<00:06:51.500> demons

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
muscles swings his giant sword demons

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.280 
muscles swings his giant sword demons
but<00:06:53.060> upon<00:06:53.330> looking<00:06:53.480> closer<00:06:53.870> it<00:06:54.020> actually

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
but upon looking closer it actually

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.320 
but upon looking closer it actually
handles<00:06:54.740> a<00:06:54.830> lot<00:06:55.010> of<00:06:55.070> really<00:06:55.460> difficult<00:06:55.640> topics

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
handles a lot of really difficult topics

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.440 
handles a lot of really difficult topics
and<00:06:56.570> follows<00:06:57.440> a<00:06:57.470> man<00:06:57.980> from<00:06:58.310> confusion<00:06:59.150> to

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
and follows a man from confusion to

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.860 
and follows a man from confusion to
clarity<00:06:59.800> and<00:07:00.800> then<00:07:01.070> into<00:07:01.490> madness<00:07:01.700> I<00:07:02.240> didn't

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
clarity and then into madness I didn't

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.900 
clarity and then into madness I didn't
like<00:07:03.110> the<00:07:03.320> ending<00:07:03.350> but<00:07:04.130> I<00:07:04.220> can<00:07:04.400> concede<00:07:04.880> that

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
like the ending but I can concede that

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.720 
like the ending but I can concede that
it<00:07:05.810> was<00:07:06.020> a<00:07:06.050> fitting<00:07:06.590> ending<00:07:06.980> for<00:07:07.220> the<00:07:07.340> series

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:07.730 
it was a fitting ending for the series

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.090 
it was a fitting ending for the series
because<00:07:08.480> when<00:07:08.660> you<00:07:08.750> get<00:07:08.900> down<00:07:09.080> to<00:07:09.320> it<00:07:09.350> guts<00:07:09.950> is

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
because when you get down to it guts is

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.130 
because when you get down to it guts is
actually<00:07:10.490> fulfilling<00:07:11.240> his<00:07:11.480> purpose<00:07:11.690> by

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
actually fulfilling his purpose by

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.780 
actually fulfilling his purpose by
continuing<00:07:12.830> to<00:07:13.010> swing<00:07:13.250> the<00:07:13.400> sword

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
continuing to swing the sword

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.640 
continuing to swing the sword
it's<00:07:14.180> a<00:07:14.300> sad<00:07:14.510> and<00:07:14.780> sobering<00:07:14.990> series

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
it's a sad and sobering series

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.260 
it's a sad and sobering series
conclusion<00:07:16.070> but<00:07:16.430> it's<00:07:16.550> really<00:07:16.790> the<00:07:16.910> best<00:07:17.030> way

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
conclusion but it's really the best way

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.810 
conclusion but it's really the best way
that<00:07:17.480> it<00:07:17.600> could<00:07:17.750> have<00:07:17.870> gone<00:07:18.020> and<00:07:18.560> so<00:07:18.950> that's

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
that it could have gone and so that's

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.700 
that it could have gone and so that's
the<00:07:20.090> end<00:07:20.120> of<00:07:20.660> the<00:07:20.960> berserk

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
the end of the berserk

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.410 
the end of the berserk
