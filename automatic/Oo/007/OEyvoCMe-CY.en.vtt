recommended settings to begin with with
your<00:00:34.980> flash<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
your flash so what we do is we take the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.850 
your flash so what we do is we take the
strap<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.760> put<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.110> top<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> your

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
strap and put it on the very top of your

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.030 
strap and put it on the very top of your
flash<00:00:41.160> unit<00:00:41.809> make<00:00:42.809> sure<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.350> turn<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
flash unit make sure that you turn the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.479 
flash unit make sure that you turn the
flash<00:00:44.700> unit<00:00:45.110> perpendicular<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.559> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
flash unit perpendicular because this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450 
flash unit perpendicular because this
product<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.329> meant<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:50.160> shot

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
product is meant to be actually shot

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
product is meant to be actually shot
sideways<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> neat<00:00:51.480> thing<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
sideways and the neat thing about that

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.270 
sideways and the neat thing about that
is<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.559> shoot<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.800> verticals<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
is that you can shoot your verticals and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.529 
is that you can shoot your verticals and
horizontals<00:00:53.690> without<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> flash<00:00:55.110> bracket<00:00:56.539> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
horizontals without a flash bracket so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
horizontals without a flash bracket so
once<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> strap<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
once that's on now we have the strap and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090 
once that's on now we have the strap and
what<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> strap<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.739> have

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
what you do with the strap is you have

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.960 
what you do with the strap is you have
the<00:01:02.430> belts<00:01:03.589> outward<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.729> let's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the belts outward like this so let's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
the belts outward like this so let's
just<00:01:06.150> say<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.420> they're<00:01:06.570> toward<00:01:06.840> me<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.500> I'll

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
just say that they're toward me and I'll

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
just say that they're toward me and I'll
take<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> furry<00:01:09.090> part<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> velcro<00:01:10.010> with

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
take the furry part of the velcro with

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
take the furry part of the velcro with
my<00:01:11.820> name<00:01:12.740> right<00:01:13.740> side<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.330> this

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
my name right side up so just like this

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
my name right side up so just like this
and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.960> turn<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> furry<00:01:17.040> side

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and you turn it so that the furry side

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.050 
and you turn it so that the furry side
of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> velcro<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:19.229> outward<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.939> I'm

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
of the velcro is outward and then I'm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
of the velcro is outward and then I'm
just<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> thread<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> through<00:01:21.900> these

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
just going to thread it through these

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:33.630 
just going to thread it through these
holes<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:22.590> here

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.499 

like<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:36.220> then<00:01:37.220> I'll<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:38.090> go<00:01:38.240> ahead<00:01:38.299> and

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
like this then I'll just go ahead and

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.760 
like this then I'll just go ahead and
turn<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.720> like<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.850> becomes<00:01:41.240> a

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
turn it like this so that it becomes a

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.800 
turn it like this so that it becomes a
three-dimensional<00:01:44.979> flash<00:01:45.979> diffuser<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.939> it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
three-dimensional flash diffuser and it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.350 
three-dimensional flash diffuser and it
actually<00:01:48.110> takes<00:01:48.319> a<00:01:48.409> really<00:01:48.560> cool<00:01:48.799> shape<00:01:49.039> here

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
actually takes a really cool shape here

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.319 
actually takes a really cool shape here
I'm<00:01:50.360> just<00:01:50.539> gonna<00:01:50.659> squeeze<00:01:51.049> this<00:01:51.259> tight<00:01:52.329> like

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
I'm just gonna squeeze this tight like

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.350 
I'm just gonna squeeze this tight like
this<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.329> becomes<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.990> very<00:01:57.560> very<00:01:58.360> strong

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
this and it becomes a very very strong

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.859 
this and it becomes a very very strong
mount<00:02:00.459> which<00:02:01.459> will<00:02:01.640> not<00:02:01.759> fall<00:02:02.000> out<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
mount which will not fall out now you

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.980 
mount which will not fall out now you
notice<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.649> have<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.630> front<00:02:05.630> face<00:02:05.959> of

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
notice that I have the front face of

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.289 
notice that I have the front face of
this<00:02:06.409> aiming<00:02:07.159> forward<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.909> reason<00:02:08.179> that

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
this aiming forward and the reason that

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.050 
this aiming forward and the reason that
is<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.539> because<00:02:08.979> if<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.220> were<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.519> put<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.849> in<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
is is because if I were to put it in the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.750 
is is because if I were to put it in the
back<00:02:11.410> what<00:02:12.410> would<00:02:12.560> happen<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.069> there<00:02:13.610> would<00:02:13.700> be

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
back what would happen is there would be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.420 
back what would happen is there would be
a<00:02:13.910> shadow<00:02:14.299> actually<00:02:14.780> from<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.349> lip<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.950> this

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
a shadow actually from this lip and this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.850 
a shadow actually from this lip and this
is<00:02:16.580> not<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> bounce<00:02:17.060> card<00:02:17.440> instead<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.650> bounce

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
is not a bounce card instead of a bounce

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.229 
is not a bounce card instead of a bounce
card<00:02:19.099> this<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.280> actually<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> shoot<00:02:20.000> through<00:02:20.209> a

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
card this is actually a shoot through a

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.569 
card this is actually a shoot through a
diffuser<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.230> lot<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.950> light<00:02:22.130> goes<00:02:22.340> up

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
diffuser so a lot of the light goes up

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.729 
diffuser so a lot of the light goes up
to<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.849> ceiling<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.019> also<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.380> fill

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
to the ceiling but this is also a fill

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.789 
to the ceiling but this is also a fill
so<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:25.519> gives<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.329> lot<00:02:26.599> of<00:02:26.630> height<00:02:26.900> away

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
so this gives you a lot of height away

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.030 
so this gives you a lot of height away
from<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.510> away<00:02:29.510> from<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.810> lens<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.260> again<00:02:31.010> I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
from the away from the lens and again I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.360 
from the away from the lens and again I
can<00:02:31.280> shoot<00:02:31.489> my<00:02:31.640> verticals<00:02:32.090> or<00:02:32.329> horizontals

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
can shoot my verticals or horizontals

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.330 
can shoot my verticals or horizontals
like<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:36.530> shoot<00:02:36.709> my<00:02:36.739> verticals<00:02:37.220> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
like this I can shoot my verticals and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.580 
like this I can shoot my verticals and
horizontals<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.019> have

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
horizontals just like this and have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.830 
horizontals just like this and have
quite<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.950> bit<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.250> distance<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.910> height<00:02:41.150> away

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
quite a bit of distance and height away

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.670 
quite a bit of distance and height away
from<00:02:42.139> my<00:02:42.319> lens<00:02:42.620> too<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.579> reduce<00:02:43.819> redeye<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.139> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
from my lens too to reduce redeye and I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.599 
from my lens too to reduce redeye and I
don't<00:02:45.739> need<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.100> use<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.519> flash<00:02:47.269> bracket<00:02:48.609> now

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
don't need to use a flash bracket now

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.879 
don't need to use a flash bracket now
there's<00:02:49.850> different<00:02:50.709> flaps

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
there's different flaps

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.870 
there's different flaps
this<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.840> regular<00:02:53.840> flap<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:55.280> is

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
this is the regular flap and this is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.240 
this is the regular flap and this is
kind<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.600> same<00:02:56.840> thing<00:02:57.109> as<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.650> dome<00:02:57.920> on

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
kind of the same thing as the dome on

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.000 
kind of the same thing as the dome on
the<00:02:58.790> light<00:02:59.269> sphere<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.139> reason<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.799> here

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the light sphere the reason this is here

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.740 
the light sphere the reason this is here
is<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.880> will<00:03:02.060> cut<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.299> amount<00:03:02.660> of

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
is so that it will cut the amount of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.990 
is so that it will cut the amount of
light<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.139> ceiling<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.370> example<00:03:04.790> if<00:03:04.880> I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
light to the ceiling so for example if I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.729 
light to the ceiling so for example if I
have<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> really<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.750> super<00:03:05.959> low<00:03:06.290> ceiling

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
have a really really super low ceiling

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.580 
have a really really super low ceiling
and<00:03:07.299> your<00:03:08.299> person's<00:03:08.690> wearing<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.019> hat<00:03:09.200> or<00:03:09.230> has

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
and your person's wearing a hat or has

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.259 
and your person's wearing a hat or has
deep<00:03:09.829> set<00:03:10.069> eyes<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.700> don't<00:03:10.760> want<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.000> have<00:03:11.090> too

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
deep set eyes you don't want to have too

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.000 
deep set eyes you don't want to have too
much<00:03:11.389> of<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.660> bounce<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.230> will<00:03:12.380> make<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.829> kind

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
much of a bounce that will make it kind

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.379 
much of a bounce that will make it kind
of<00:03:13.069> look<00:03:13.190> kind<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.459> creepy<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> lights

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
of look kind of creepy like the lights

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.319 
of look kind of creepy like the lights
coming<00:03:14.780> from<00:03:14.870> straight<00:03:15.260> above<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:17.120> want

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
coming from straight above so you want

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.789 
coming from straight above so you want
to<00:03:17.420> reduce<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.930> amount<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.290> light<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.500> goes

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
to reduce the amount of light that goes

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.069 
to reduce the amount of light that goes
to<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.100> ceiling<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.579> in<00:03:20.329> fact<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.720> can<00:03:20.900> pull

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
to the ceiling and in fact you can pull

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.319 
to the ceiling and in fact you can pull
it<00:03:21.200> all<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.440> way<00:03:21.620> back<00:03:21.889> like<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.730> send

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
it all the way back like this and send

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.210 
it all the way back like this and send
more<00:03:23.480> light<00:03:23.720> directly<00:03:24.170> forward<00:03:24.500> into<00:03:25.130> the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
more light directly forward into the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.759 
more light directly forward into the
diffuser<00:03:25.639> as<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.329> see<00:03:26.510> from<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.840> rear<00:03:27.079> it

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
diffuser as you can see from the rear it

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.400 
diffuser as you can see from the rear it
becomes<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.489> kicker<00:03:29.329> panel<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:30.049> send<00:03:30.290> more

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
becomes a kicker panel to send more

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.559 
becomes a kicker panel to send more
light<00:03:30.620> forward<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.549> diffuser<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.420> can

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
light forward to the diffuser you can

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.839 
light forward to the diffuser you can
also<00:03:32.750> mount<00:03:33.079> on<00:03:33.380> here<00:03:33.579> this

also mount on here this
an<00:03:34.969> accessory<00:03:35.780> flap<00:03:36.109> which<00:03:36.409> is<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.680> amber

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
an accessory flap which is the amber

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.929 
an accessory flap which is the amber
flap<00:03:37.689> and<00:03:38.689> just<00:03:39.680> for<00:03:39.859> simplicity<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.760> can

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
flap and just for simplicity you can

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.929 
flap and just for simplicity you can
pull<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.659> other<00:03:41.780> one<00:03:41.959> off<00:03:42.609> but<00:03:43.609> what's<00:03:43.760> neat

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
pull the other one off but what's neat

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.270 
pull the other one off but what's neat
about<00:03:43.969> the<00:03:44.269> amber<00:03:44.569> flap<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:45.260> when<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:45.980> have

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
about the amber flap is when you have

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.869 
about the amber flap is when you have
say<00:03:47.269> for<00:03:47.480> example<00:03:48.219> you<00:03:49.219> want<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.489> warm<00:03:49.670> the

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
say for example you want to warm the

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.819 
say for example you want to warm the
ceiling<00:03:50.269> simply<00:03:50.840> pull<00:03:51.049> this<00:03:51.170> back<00:03:51.409> just<00:03:51.680> like

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
ceiling simply pull this back just like

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.440 
ceiling simply pull this back just like
this<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.310> you'll<00:03:52.670> notice<00:03:52.969> that<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.239> light

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
this and you'll notice that the light

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.270 
this and you'll notice that the light
that<00:03:53.719> goes<00:03:54.260> upwards<00:03:54.859> will<00:03:55.549> be<00:03:57.099> pushed<00:03:58.099> through

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
that goes upwards will be pushed through

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.000 
that goes upwards will be pushed through
the<00:03:58.400> warmth<00:03:58.700> warming<00:03:59.209> filter<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.799> then<00:04:00.799> if<00:04:00.919> I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
the warmth warming filter and then if I

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.190 
the warmth warming filter and then if I
want<00:04:01.219> to<00:04:01.310> turn<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.579> entire<00:04:01.700> light<00:04:02.209> warmer<00:04:02.629> for

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
want to turn the entire light warmer for

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.479 
want to turn the entire light warmer for
example<00:04:03.560> if<00:04:03.650> I'm<00:04:03.769> dragging<00:04:04.189> the<00:04:04.219> shutter

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
example if I'm dragging the shutter

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.309 
example if I'm dragging the shutter
speed<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:04.969> ambient<00:04:05.359> lighting<00:04:05.569> I'll<00:04:06.200> just

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
speed and ambient lighting I'll just

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.629 
speed and ambient lighting I'll just
pull<00:04:06.499> this<00:04:06.590> thing<00:04:06.769> all<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:06.950> way<00:04:07.129> down<00:04:07.370> and

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
pull this thing all the way down and

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.690 
pull this thing all the way down and
then<00:04:08.239> what<00:04:08.419> it'll<00:04:08.569> do<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:09.049> it<00:04:09.859> will<00:04:09.980> kick<00:04:10.250> amber

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
then what it'll do is it will kick amber

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.050 
then what it'll do is it will kick amber
light<00:04:10.909> into<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.780> front<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.169> diffuser

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
light into the front of the diffuser

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.930 
light into the front of the diffuser
again<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:15.349> gives<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> lot<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.009> height<00:04:16.280> away

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
again it gives you a lot of height away

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.150 
again it gives you a lot of height away
from<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.269> lens<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.769> can<00:04:18.919> shoot<00:04:19.039> your

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
from the lens and you can shoot your

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.240 
from the lens and you can shoot your
vertical<00:04:19.549> or<00:04:19.669> horizontal<00:04:19.959> up<00:04:20.959> down<00:04:21.259> always

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
vertical or horizontal up down always

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.620 
vertical or horizontal up down always
point<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:22.699> straight<00:04:23.240> up<00:04:23.270> toward<00:04:23.599> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
point this straight up toward the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.879 
point this straight up toward the
ceiling<00:04:23.870> if<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.620> can<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:26.770> have<00:04:27.770> it

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
ceiling if you can and and have it

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.529 
ceiling if you can and and have it
sideways<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.430> like<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.789> this<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.389> also

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
sideways just like that this is also

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.060 
sideways just like that this is also
neat<00:04:29.840> when<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.050> want<00:04:30.229> to<00:04:30.320> give<00:04:30.440> just<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.830> little

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
neat when you want to give just a little

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.159 
neat when you want to give just a little
bit<00:04:31.190> warmer<00:04:31.490> skin<00:04:31.759> tones<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.870> when<00:04:33.050> you're

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
bit warmer skin tones so when you're

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.260 
bit warmer skin tones so when you're
shooting<00:04:33.380> low<00:04:34.220> speed<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.910> you're<00:04:35.030> trying<00:04:35.240> to

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
shooting low speed and you're trying to

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.909 
shooting low speed and you're trying to
drag<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.660> shutter<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.169> capture<00:04:36.590> more<00:04:36.620> of<00:04:36.830> the

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
drag the shutter and capture more of the

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.830 
drag the shutter and capture more of the
ambient<00:04:37.340> light<00:04:37.520> color<00:04:37.820> you'll<00:04:38.389> notice<00:04:38.720> that

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
ambient light color you'll notice that

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.540 
ambient light color you'll notice that
your<00:04:38.990> flash<00:04:39.199> is<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.470> little<00:04:39.740> bit<00:04:39.889> too<00:04:40.039> white<00:04:40.250> and

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
your flash is a little bit too white and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.310 
your flash is a little bit too white and
it<00:04:40.669> looks<00:04:40.849> artificial<00:04:41.539> when<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.900> bring<00:04:42.169> in

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
it looks artificial when you bring in

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.279 
it looks artificial when you bring in
the<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:43.130> amber<00:04:43.580> filter<00:04:44.240> what<00:04:44.900> it'll<00:04:45.050> do<00:04:45.259> is

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
the the amber filter what it'll do is

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.560 
the the amber filter what it'll do is
it'll<00:04:45.590> even<00:04:45.949> up<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.280> lighting<00:04:47.180> in<00:04:47.389> the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it'll even up the lighting in the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:55.899 
it'll even up the lighting in the
subject<00:04:48.199> as<00:04:48.320> well<00:04:48.349> as<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.680> background<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:55.699> now

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
subject as well as the background so now

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.870 
subject as well as the background so now
we<00:04:56.750> have<00:04:56.930> Jacqueline<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:57.710> relaxing<00:04:58.580> next<00:04:58.820> to

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
we have Jacqueline just relaxing next to

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.270 
we have Jacqueline just relaxing next to
the<00:04:58.970> bar<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.360> that's<00:04:59.570> that's<00:04:59.810> a<00:05:00.020> great<00:05:00.500> great

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
the bar and that's that's a great great

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.460 
the bar and that's that's a great great
setting<00:05:01.610> right<00:05:01.729> there<00:05:01.870> what<00:05:02.870> I'm<00:05:02.990> gonna<00:05:03.110> do<00:05:03.320> is

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
setting right there what I'm gonna do is

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.749 
setting right there what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.740> do<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:04.009> a<00:05:04.099> couple<00:05:04.220> shots<00:05:04.520> with

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
I'm going to do just a couple shots with

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.850 
I'm going to do just a couple shots with
standard<00:05:05.570> lighting<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.050> you'll<00:05:06.199> just<00:05:06.259> see

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
standard lighting so you'll just see

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.740 
standard lighting so you'll just see
what<00:05:06.979> this<00:05:07.099> winds<00:05:07.610> up<00:05:07.699> looking<00:05:07.820> like<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:08.449> so

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
what this winds up looking like and so

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.520 
what this winds up looking like and so
we'll<00:05:09.440> do<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.620> horizontal<00:05:10.009> and<00:05:11.259> just<00:05:12.259> like<00:05:12.380> that

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
we'll do a horizontal and just like that

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.200 
we'll do a horizontal and just like that
again<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:12.860> is<00:05:12.919> 50<00:05:13.340> millimeter<00:05:13.759> lens<00:05:13.849> it's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
again this is 50 millimeter lens it's

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.270 
again this is 50 millimeter lens it's
very<00:05:14.479> very<00:05:14.720> harsh<00:05:14.960> very<00:05:15.500> harsh<00:05:15.620> looking

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
very very harsh very harsh looking

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.890 
very very harsh very harsh looking
lighting<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.759> then<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:17.360> I'll<00:05:17.509> bounce<00:05:17.690> off

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
lighting and then now I'll bounce off

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.880 
lighting and then now I'll bounce off
the<00:05:18.050> ceiling

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.010 

and<00:05:23.890> as<00:05:24.280> you<00:05:24.430> can<00:05:24.580> see<00:05:24.640> that's<00:05:25.570> what<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:25.870> looks

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
and as you can see that's what it looks

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.480 
and as you can see that's what it looks
like<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:26.410> that's<00:05:26.500> not<00:05:26.710> really<00:05:26.980> an<00:05:27.070> option<00:05:27.190> for

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
like so that's not really an option for

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.390 
like so that's not really an option for
a<00:05:27.700> situation<00:05:27.880> like<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.600> so<00:05:29.350> when<00:05:30.130> we're

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
a situation like this so when we're

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.940 
a situation like this so when we're
anywhere<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:31.870> this<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.590> neat<00:05:32.770> thing

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
anywhere and and this is the neat thing

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.340 
anywhere and and this is the neat thing
about<00:05:33.240> being<00:05:34.240> able<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.510> do<00:05:34.660> photography<00:05:34.870> and

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
about being able to do photography and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.960 
about being able to do photography and
understanding<00:05:35.920> composition<00:05:36.520> but<00:05:36.640> mostly

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
understanding composition but mostly

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.910 
understanding composition but mostly
lighting<00:05:37.480> and<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:38.050> thing<00:05:38.230> about<00:05:38.410> lighting<00:05:38.710> is

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
lighting and the thing about lighting is

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.740 
lighting and the thing about lighting is
we<00:05:39.040> want<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.310> flash<00:05:39.550> to<00:05:39.820> disappear<00:05:40.300> we<00:05:40.540> want

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
we want the flash to disappear we want

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.330 
we want the flash to disappear we want
it<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.990> look<00:05:41.020> like<00:05:41.200> it's<00:05:41.560> not<00:05:41.620> flash<00:05:42.010> and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
it to look like it's not flash and

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.760 
it to look like it's not flash and
what's<00:05:43.090> neat<00:05:43.300> about<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.660> origami<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.530> that

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
what's neat about the origami is that

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.410 
what's neat about the origami is that
the<00:05:44.890> origami<00:05:45.220> will<00:05:45.490> send<00:05:45.730> a<00:05:45.760> majority<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.300> the

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
the origami will send a majority to the

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.230 
the origami will send a majority to the
light<00:05:46.540> to<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.870> ceiling<00:05:47.230> and<00:05:47.920> it<00:05:48.460> will<00:05:48.670> send

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
light to the ceiling and it will send

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.780 
light to the ceiling and it will send
some<00:05:49.510> of<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.780> flash<00:05:50.130> toward<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.220> model<00:05:51.520> in<00:05:51.670> a

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
some of the flash toward the model in a

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.670 
some of the flash toward the model in a
very<00:05:52.000> very<00:05:52.240> nice<00:05:52.420> soft<00:05:52.780> way<00:05:53.020> so<00:05:53.440> what<00:05:53.590> I'm

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
very very nice soft way so what I'm

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.640 
very very nice soft way so what I'm
gonna<00:05:53.770> do<00:05:53.980> here<00:05:54.400> is<00:05:54.520> I'm<00:05:54.610> going<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.240> just<00:05:55.720> have

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
gonna do here is I'm going to just have

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.930 
gonna do here is I'm going to just have
her<00:05:56.980> where<00:05:57.310> she

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
her where she

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.640 
her where she
that's<00:05:58.540> actually<00:05:58.900> perfect<00:05:59.080> right<00:05:59.410> where<00:05:59.440> you

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
that's actually perfect right where you
