slippers in the dremel idea builder it
is<00:00:08.809> a<00:00:08.840> new<00:00:09.580> ish<00:00:10.580> 3d<00:00:11.539> printer<00:00:11.959> that<00:00:11.990> is<00:00:12.260> designed

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
is a new ish 3d printer that is designed

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.240 
is a new ish 3d printer that is designed
for<00:00:13.070> home<00:00:13.699> use<00:00:14.059> these<00:00:14.779> shoes<00:00:15.379> it<00:00:15.740> should<00:00:15.920> take

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
for home use these shoes it should take

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.530 
for home use these shoes it should take
about<00:00:16.750> 32<00:00:17.750> minutes

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.870 

it's<00:00:21.990> gonna<00:00:22.080> go<00:00:22.290> row<00:00:22.530> by<00:00:22.710> row<00:00:22.890> essentially<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it's gonna go row by row essentially and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.109 
it's gonna go row by row essentially and
just<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.620> build<00:00:25.620> the<00:00:26.190> shoe<00:00:26.490> based<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
just like build the shoe based on a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.350 
just like build the shoe based on a
pattern<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.600> is<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.200> computer<00:00:29.360> even

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
pattern that is on the computer even

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.550 
pattern that is on the computer even
small<00:00:30.570> projects<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.200> can<00:00:31.410> take

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
small projects like this can take

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370 
small projects like this can take
upwards<00:00:31.770> of<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.640> 45<00:00:33.300> minutes<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.170> just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
upwards of in it like 45 minutes so just

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.600 
upwards of in it like 45 minutes so just
be<00:00:34.739> warned<00:00:35.220> if<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:35.550> ever<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> 3d<00:00:36.570> printer
