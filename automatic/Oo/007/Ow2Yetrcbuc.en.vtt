varnishes said that the brushes that

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.140 
varnishes said that the brushes that
were<00:02:02.720> included<00:02:03.220> may<00:02:04.220> not<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.940> been<00:02:04.970> the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
were included may not have been the

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.850 
were included may not have been the
brushes<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.660> are<00:02:05.840> going<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.230> be<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.470> final

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
brushes that are going to be the final

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.070 
brushes that are going to be the final
product<00:02:07.190> because<00:02:08.060> there<00:02:08.509> was<00:02:08.630> something

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
product because there was something

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.990 
product because there was something
wrong<00:02:09.110> with<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.740> manufacturer<00:02:10.399> or<00:02:10.640> something

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
wrong with the manufacturer or something

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.970 
wrong with the manufacturer or something
like<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.930> application<00:02:12.500> looks<00:02:12.710> a<00:02:12.830> little

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
like that the application looks a little

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.400 
like that the application looks a little
bit<00:02:13.160> weird<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.690> may<00:02:14.690> be<00:02:14.750> because<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.380> a

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
bit weird it may be because I have a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.050 
bit weird it may be because I have a
wonky<00:02:15.620> brush<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.370> just<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.700> when<00:02:17.030> you

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
wonky brush but just know that when you

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.240 
wonky brush but just know that when you
go<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.330> purchase<00:02:17.840> them<00:02:18.050> you're<00:02:18.770> not<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.190> to

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
go to purchase them you're not going to

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.710 
go to purchase them you're not going to
get<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.520> brush<00:02:19.850> it's<00:02:20.150> not<00:02:20.330> going<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.600> be<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
get this brush it's not going to be that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.740 
get this brush it's not going to be that
weird<00:02:21.080> um<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.580> know<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.450> want<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.630> throw

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
weird um you know I just want to throw

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.300 
weird um you know I just want to throw
that<00:02:23.960> out<00:02:24.020> there<00:02:24.350> in<00:02:24.590> case<00:02:24.650> anyone's<00:02:25.220> looking

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that out there in case anyone's looking

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.460 
that out there in case anyone's looking
at<00:02:25.670> my<00:02:25.760> swatches<00:02:26.030> being<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.320> wrong

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
at my swatches being like what is wrong

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.260 
at my swatches being like what is wrong
with<00:02:27.590> her<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> first<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.120> is

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
with her so the first one that I have is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.330 
with her so the first one that I have is
called<00:02:29.510> Jubilee<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.010> kind<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.220> like

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
called Jubilee and this is kind of like

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.420 
called Jubilee and this is kind of like
a<00:02:31.400> dark<00:02:31.790> magenta<00:02:32.480> wine<00:02:33.290> kind<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.860> color<00:02:34.070> it's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
a dark magenta wine kind of color it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.210 
a dark magenta wine kind of color it's
more<00:02:34.670> red<00:02:35.000> than<00:02:35.030> purple<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:36.110> darker<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
more red than purple it's darker in the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.190 
more red than purple it's darker in the
bottle<00:02:37.550> than<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.850> does<00:02:38.180> appear<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:38.810> your<00:02:38.840> nails

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
bottle than it does appear on your nails

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
bottle than it does appear on your nails
I<00:02:39.530> think<00:02:39.800> if<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.980> did<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.220> third<00:02:40.489> coat<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:40.910> your

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
I think if you did a third coat on your

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.699 
I think if you did a third coat on your
nails<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.690> might<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.989> able<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:42.410> what<00:02:42.560> you

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
nails you might be able to get what you

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.530 
nails you might be able to get what you
see<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.160> bottle<00:02:43.520> but<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.390> completely

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
see in the bottle but it's completely

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.300 
see in the bottle but it's completely
opaque<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.230> two<00:02:45.380> coats<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:45.830> didn't<00:02:46.190> feel

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
opaque and two coats so I didn't feel

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.550 
opaque and two coats so I didn't feel
the<00:02:46.520> need<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.880> include<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.270> third<00:02:47.720> one<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
the need to include a third one the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520 
the need to include a third one the
linear<00:02:49.010> holographic<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.360> not<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.750> strong

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
linear holographic is it's not as strong

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.170 
linear holographic is it's not as strong
as<00:02:51.830> other<00:02:52.160> ones<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.520> have<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.000> little

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
as other ones that I have it's a little

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.400 
as other ones that I have it's a little
bit<00:02:53.270> more<00:02:53.360> subtle<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:53.959> think<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.230> that's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
bit more subtle but I think that that's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.690 
bit more subtle but I think that that's
going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> work<00:02:54.860> really<00:02:55.100> really<00:02:55.190> well<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
going to work really really well in the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.240 
going to work really really well in the
fall<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.239> think<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:56.959> sometimes<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:58.130> these

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
fall I think that sometimes with these

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.880 
fall I think that sometimes with these
super-strong<00:02:58.640> hollows<00:02:59.450> they<00:03:00.200> tend<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.680> take<00:03:00.830> a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
super-strong hollows they tend to take a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.699 
super-strong hollows they tend to take a
very<00:03:01.070> silver<00:03:01.730> cast<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:03.170> has<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> very

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
very silver cast to it this has a very

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.880 
very silver cast to it this has a very

rich very jewel toned color while still

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.949 
rich very jewel toned color while still
having<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.340> holographic<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.630> really

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
having the holographic in it it's really

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.590 
having the holographic in it it's really

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.400 
this one the holographic is much
stronger<00:03:19.790> than<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.150> one<00:03:20.360> then<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.930> Jubilee

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
stronger than this one then in Jubilee

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.350 
stronger than this one then in Jubilee
it's<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.830> very<00:03:22.130> strong<00:03:22.459> holographic<00:03:23.180> while

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
it's a very strong holographic while

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.050 
it's a very strong holographic while
still<00:03:23.690> being<00:03:23.739> very<00:03:24.739> teal<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.519> one<00:03:25.670> was<00:03:25.790> also

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
still being very teal this one was also

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.030 
still being very teal this one was also
taken<00:03:26.480> two<00:03:26.630> coats<00:03:26.930> went<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.620> nail<00:03:27.739> really

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
taken two coats went on the nail really

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.280 
taken two coats went on the nail really
really<00:03:28.220> nicely<00:03:28.400> it's<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.209> thinner<00:03:29.540> formula<00:03:30.170> but

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
really nicely it's a thinner formula but

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.039 
really nicely it's a thinner formula but
it's<00:03:30.440> not<00:03:30.680> runny<00:03:31.340> like<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.060> easy<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.630> control

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
it's not runny like it's easy to control

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.430 
it's not runny like it's easy to control
um<00:03:33.500> but<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:34.519> gonna<00:03:34.940> leave<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.600> very<00:03:35.989> thin

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
um but it's gonna leave a very thin

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.320 
um but it's gonna leave a very thin
manicure<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.160> not<00:03:37.280> thick<00:03:37.640> it's<00:03:37.880> not<00:03:38.000> it's

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
manicure it's not thick it's not it's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.900 
manicure it's not thick it's not it's
it's<00:03:38.750> very<00:03:39.200> very<00:03:39.650> very<00:03:39.799> nice<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.310> then<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
it's very very very nice and then the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.670 
it's very very very nice and then the
last<00:03:41.060> one<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.360> kind<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.900> most<00:03:42.019> unique<00:03:42.320> out

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
last one is kind of the most unique out

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.289 
last one is kind of the most unique out
of<00:03:42.769> all<00:03:42.920> of<00:03:42.950> them<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.060> called

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
of all of them and this is called

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.060 
of all of them and this is called
triumph<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.260> really<00:03:45.560> think<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.830> this<00:03:46.010> is

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
triumph and I really think that this is

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.039 
triumph and I really think that this is
going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.370> be<00:03:46.489> her<00:03:46.610> best<00:03:46.790> seller<00:03:47.090> because<00:03:47.360> this

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
going to be her best seller because this

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.710 
going to be her best seller because this
is<00:03:48.200> kind<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.590> like<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:49.070> teal<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.239> purple

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
is kind of like a teal to purple

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.220 
is kind of like a teal to purple
duochrome<00:03:51.459> linear<00:03:52.459> holographic<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.989> almost

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
duochrome linear holographic it almost

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.140 
duochrome linear holographic it almost
has<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.470> little<00:03:54.799> bit<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:54.920> like<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.150> brownish

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
has a little bit of like a brownish

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.300 
has a little bit of like a brownish
purple<00:03:57.049> when<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:57.980> first<00:03:58.160> apply<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:58.610> its<00:03:58.910> kind

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
purple when you first apply it its kind

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.620 
purple when you first apply it its kind
hard<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.580> explain<00:03:59.670> i'm<00:04:00.090> really<00:04:00.330> hoping<00:04:00.450> that

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
hard to explain i'm really hoping that

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.900 
hard to explain i'm really hoping that
my<00:04:00.840> live<00:04:01.050> splotch<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.560> really<00:04:01.860> going<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.280> show

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
my live splotch is really going to show

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.790 
my live splotch is really going to show
you<00:04:02.970> guys<00:04:03.060> what<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.480> mean<00:04:03.660> with<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> color<00:04:04.140> but

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
you guys what I mean with the color but

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.530 
you guys what I mean with the color but
this<00:04:05.160> one<00:04:05.340> also<00:04:05.550> has<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.819> really<00:04:06.180> nice

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
this one also has a really nice

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.170 
this one also has a really nice
holographic<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.520> like<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.940> hit

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
holographic and this one like you hit

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.270 
holographic and this one like you hit
the<00:04:09.330> right<00:04:09.510> light<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.290> green<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:11.040> such<00:04:11.250> a

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
the right light and that green is such a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.790 
the right light and that green is such a
strong<00:04:11.790> flash<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.750> then<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.110> holographic<00:04:13.530> is

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
strong flash and then the holographic is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.720 
strong flash and then the holographic is
a<00:04:13.830> strong<00:04:14.130> flash<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:15.060> could<00:04:15.450> be<00:04:15.680> like<00:04:16.730> subtle

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
a strong flash this could be like subtle

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.509 
a strong flash this could be like subtle
but<00:04:18.269> yet<00:04:18.510> insanely<00:04:19.410> bright<00:04:19.739> at<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.100> same<00:04:20.280> time

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
but yet insanely bright at the same time

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.480 
but yet insanely bright at the same time
I<00:04:20.850> loved<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.450> fact<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.440> she<00:04:22.800> has<00:04:22.980> a<00:04:23.160> 20

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
I loved the fact that she has a 20

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.310 
I loved the fact that she has a 20
