00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello and welcome to a hardware 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.990
 review of southwest games we have 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.480
 here today the logitech g 602 the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.609
 latest gears mouse from the assortment 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.849
 by logitech she offers eight 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.429
 programmable buttons and customizable 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.260
 Childlikeness also over the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.099
 programmable buttons are in play 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.099
 can be changed 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.870
 then it will be for usb extension cable 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:50.050
 for the receiving sensor of the good 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.050
 piece 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.950
 the new sensor is not a june 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.400
 celebrate sensor as with the others 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.500
 logitech models so far but he can 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.660
 only with one of these two mouse 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.570
 be linked and thereby contains 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.670
 a better performance and one 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.470
 Latency of two milliseconds 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.360
 It should be as close to the mouse as possible 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.770
 it will be placed for this 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.280
 Cable attached the mouse feels fine 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.440
 on 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.300
 she is very handy and has a high 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.880
 surface on the side we have 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.930
 six programmable buttons and 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 on top of that again two silver das 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.750
 Cable should only for this receiver 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.750
 be used 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.110
 here in the near view we still see 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.090
 times the function keys in the side and 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.860
 Although the same start to take the water 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.390
 is very precisely made that is the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.549
 mode selector here you can 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.119
 between performance and endurance mode 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.700
 switch over to endurance mode is the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.420
 Battery life up to 1000 hours in the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 performance was the 250 hours 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 The mouse is with two batteries 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.470
 but provided it is sufficient a 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:29.049
 for operation from performance mode 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:31.360
 glows blue from the mode green on the 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.549
 logitech homepage can be the logitech 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.430
 gaming software can be downloaded 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.290
 It is for Mac OS and for Windows 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.890
 available to throw a small look 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.670
 thereon 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.430
 Here we can in the settings for 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.100
 the special keys are a sign 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.000
 combination or single sign 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.000
 Add 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.390
 then we can go here with the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.600
 different sampling rates for the mouse 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.640
 to adjust 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.230
 there are many different ones 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.569
 setting options 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.140
 But let's come to something 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:15.710
 more interesting 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.710
 a small practical test based on 2 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.879
 is already very precise 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.420
 who does that all right? 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.420
 fun 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 I say goodbye to these pictures 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.260
 now from the first hardware review of 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.520
