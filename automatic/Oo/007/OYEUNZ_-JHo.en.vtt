00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.310
 the unicum 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.010
 this offer has to lie 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.270
 I think it's just a dollar 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.520
 something about what is there annoys many 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.930

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.950
 for the people who did not see it 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.730
 he is able to do without somewhere 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.640
 easy for the helpers 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.690

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.360

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.230

 Shocked Hay is under the sun 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.500
 However, that does not show the assumption 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.500
 I probably already have 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.250
