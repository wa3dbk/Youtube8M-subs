harnesses<00:02:03.010> although<00:02:03.460> that's<00:02:03.610> pretty<00:02:03.940> little

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
harnesses although that's pretty little

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
expensive but breeding harnesses make

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.630 
expensive but breeding harnesses make
breeding<00:02:08.080> their<00:02:08.319> animals<00:02:08.740> some<00:02:08.890> much<00:02:09.100> easier

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
breeding their animals some much easier

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.949 
breeding their animals some much easier
because<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.030> just<00:02:10.209> simply<00:02:10.450> puts<00:02:10.690> them<00:02:10.840> in

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
because it just simply puts them in

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.280 
because it just simply puts them in
place

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.759

that bridge which later on oh I'll give

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380 
that bridge which later on oh I'll give
a<00:02:22.530> proper<00:02:22.980> tour<00:02:23.219> when<00:02:23.430> things<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.939> more<00:02:24.120> built

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
might show later I actually deactivated

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.729 
might show later I actually deactivated
another<00:03:34.909> portal<00:03:35.330> on<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.629> end<00:03:35.870> basically

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
another portal on this end basically

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.890 
another portal on this end basically
because<00:03:37.069> after<00:03:37.519> all<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.849> frustration<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.659> was

because after all that frustration I was

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.470 
because after all that frustration I was
just<00:03:39.200> like<00:03:39.440> no<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.250> done<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> don't<00:03:41.000> want<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.390> go

just like no I'm done I don't want to go
back<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.900> another<00:03:42.049> any<00:03:42.290> more<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.650> now

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
back to another any more right now

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.490 
back to another any more right now
for<00:03:43.940> now<00:03:45.879> so<00:03:46.879> I've<00:03:47.060> collected<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.810> lot<00:03:48.379> of

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
for now so I've collected a lot of

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.619 
for now so I've collected a lot of
different<00:03:48.739> materials<00:03:49.250> soul<00:03:50.060> sand<00:03:50.360> glowstone

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.930 
different materials soul sand glowstone
nether<00:03:53.629> rapped<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.650> some<00:03:55.340> several<00:03:55.760> blaze

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
nether rapped and some several blaze

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.509 
nether rapped and some several blaze
rods<00:03:56.209> eleven<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.780> them<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.019> think<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.349> was<00:03:57.519> so

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519

rods eleven of them I think it was so
I've<00:03:58.760> got<00:03:58.940> plenty<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.239> materials<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.840> get

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
I've got plenty of materials to get

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.199 
I've got plenty of materials to get
things<00:04:00.230> moving<00:04:00.620> toward<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.220> next<00:04:01.400> few<00:04:01.910> steps

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
things moving toward the next few steps

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.800 
things moving toward the next few steps
of<00:04:02.510> better<00:04:02.930> than<00:04:03.079> wolves<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.940> right<00:04:05.150> now<00:04:05.420> I'm

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
of better than wolves but right now I'm

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.410 
of better than wolves but right now I'm
in<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.170> process<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.829> moving<00:04:07.010> toward<00:04:07.519> building

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
in the process of moving toward building

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.229 
in the process of moving toward building
a<00:04:08.660> windmill<00:04:09.019> which<00:04:09.829> I've<00:04:10.099> done<00:04:10.609> yet<00:04:10.910> because<00:04:11.060> I

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
a windmill which I've done yet because I

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.199 
a windmill which I've done yet because I
haven't<00:04:11.450> gotten<00:04:11.660> him<00:04:12.200> yet<00:04:12.980> or<00:04:13.640> not<00:04:14.030> him<00:04:14.299> yet

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
haven't gotten him yet or not him yet

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.090 
haven't gotten him yet or not him yet
normally<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.239> build<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.750> big<00:04:17.930> Hempfield<00:04:18.440> but<00:04:18.859> in

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
normally I build a big Hempfield but in

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.080 
normally I build a big Hempfield but in
these<00:04:19.280> icy<00:04:19.699> conditions<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.359> decided<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:21.139> know

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
these icy conditions I decided you know

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:31.900 
these icy conditions I decided you know
as<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.300> said<00:04:23.360> before<00:04:25.150> hmm

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.310 

I<00:04:31.940> think<00:04:32.420> it's<00:04:32.570> a<00:04:32.600> nice<00:04:32.750> feature<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.910> heads

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
I think it's a nice feature that heads

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.620 
I think it's a nice feature that heads
come<00:04:36.320> off<00:04:36.440> more<00:04:36.740> easily<00:04:36.770> with<00:04:37.340> axes<00:04:37.880> been

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
come off more easily with axes been

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.250 
come off more easily with axes been
better<00:04:38.840> than<00:04:38.960> wolves<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:41.360> now<00:04:42.020> I'll<00:04:42.140> have

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
better than wolves and now I'll have

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.730 
better than wolves and now I'll have
some<00:04:42.470> pumpkins<00:04:42.950> finally<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.240> add<00:04:44.450> a<00:04:44.740> new

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740
