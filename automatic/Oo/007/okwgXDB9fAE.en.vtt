00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 there are at mcdonald's venom with 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.049
 Mashed potatoes actually make him 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.170
 not broken now so i do what i do 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.170
 want 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.869
 we play today is a new game and 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.450
 you probably know who 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:32.119
 would first ask who would he 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:34.700
 voluntarily go to the old house but they 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.230
 really must agree without us 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.730
 We have to discuss that 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.280
 someday probably separate or what means 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.789
 that's nice stories 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.829
 who would he be with sexy julia lingerie 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.429
 I do not like going shopping 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.800
 shopping and is also there if that 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.920
 My advice is that you have to 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.929
 you always have to decide 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.030
 I would do that, I'll see 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.140
 I've never thought so clearly 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.690
 made caught 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.320
 the 70 makes you many things then 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.120
 first time 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.950
 I would be in the neighbor 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.890
 Hide the dressing room 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.480
 we watch how the whole thing does not work out 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.950
 For control purposes only I am simple 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.040
 curious but you can also equal 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.300
 go yourself 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:27.560
 Who would he number three at the zoo? 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.150
 a penguin clown penguins clown that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.300
 I basically ever think so 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.250
 not okay so willi is still 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.470
 rather he understands the animal firmly 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.120
 That's why I'm clearly saying milli me 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.760
 would be a bit scared of his 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.020
 wet cold penguin i know too 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.090
 not if I would hear 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.390
 I would still rather be 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.960
 trust as nixdorf but still 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.000
 the one 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.160
 I do not like that as yet 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.940
 worse than that with the lingerie for 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.810
 good cause 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.640
 ohso penguin of good purpose well 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.500
 but try only the highlander again 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.810
 come back are just do it 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.209
 The Antarctic rescues the Antarctic 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.209
 a stolen penguin that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.810
 Who would he be at McDonald's? 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.819
 order with potato porridge there are times 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
 with donald's venison with potato porridge 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.800
 some of the joke makes him now 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.900
 not broken so I do what I want 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.370
 we do not have that in the program 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.180
 a reputable does not fit in between 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.349
 these between these two parts 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.090
 But that's important for me now 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.130
 that knows if that's a joke then 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.660
 I would do it even if it as the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.310
 will give you plenty to eat then you would 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.840
 I want the highest of course 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.760
 maybe send it and say that 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.980
 have just made the back of the week 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.920
 So weeks but that would be the then 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.470
 probably somehow beer bike week 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.670
 or so call in German lead 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.790
 we do not say that 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.500
 I 'll do that well 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.319
 if that is a shock is that supposed 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.440
 that's funny, who would he be one? 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.099
 Expired title soup can eat me 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.150
 do not even discuss 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.430
 that is completely clear 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.049
 I have no problems with that, but me 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.670
 would probably rather play bingo 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.950
 Bingo is going to play me right now 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.420
 very much to my parents in the old have the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.590
 always bingo and get it for it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.940
 chocolate so therefore you 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.459
 trouble you mean i should do that 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.230
 Do you do that I do not like that 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.519
 but that is not out of order with her now 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.620
 a bleeding mood blunder 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.680
 So good for the chocolate its 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.299
 I also like chocolate 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.299
 he would swim with sharks 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.170
 I do not swim ole heyer that way either 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.930
 happy for me always uncertain so with 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.060
 Pure would be even worse 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.879
 Klop there you have to get out 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.739
 I did not make too with home 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.780
 let's just say no, we'll do that 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.599
 not point out over 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.640
 but let us know who wants to keep up 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.489
 that now as well as are not servers 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.170
 no life weary to do it 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.190
 could 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:19.070
 we do not do the edge exactly 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.699
 So if you liked this one 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.270
 game 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.220
 let us know write us and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.889
 also likes to comment on that and a lot 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.389
 a few clever questions we ask here then 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.930
 also a sofa each other 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.789
 can 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.789
 otherwise that was 70 again
