00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.330
 we 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.610
 hard 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.390
 I have worked both arms flame 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.420
 jumps to 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.150
 15-0 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.780
 that he was right that he has come home in 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.780
 that moment 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.540
 the raised rafa 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.540
 to see what happens on the back 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.409
 and he asks for truth because this little 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.809
 gift the Swiss double luck 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.469
 because then the volley I think the mind 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 with the cane 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.780
 if you do not touch it and with the heart of 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.780
 rackets 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.700
 I did 30 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 I repeat of emotion 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.479
 now in this game to close the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.479
 match 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.570
 forget the low volley net 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.640
 and a desperate road of April 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.299
 to 30 equal rafa to two points of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.299
 sentence 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.100
 he has recovered to jump 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.769
 overcome by the same 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.860
 how do we try to sell a little more 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.980
 expensive 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.620
 I am looking for this defeat another one more before 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.030
 Rafael Nadal 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.030
 it would be the eleventh 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.090
 match ball 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.739
 do not 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 everyone 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.020
 he is letting go 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.470
 the Swiss player 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.300
 together equal 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.850
 curious that now that he sees the game 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.400
 totally lost is when a little 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.400
 they go back to him 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.420
 you are playing loose without tension without 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.420
 pressure and you can let go of the arm 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.270
 siemens here happens 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.730
 and therefore advantage for factory 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.560
 and now it's costing him to close 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.510
 and now rafael that has been put there as 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.550
 tense has seen that he is going to jump he had 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.400
 gone from the game and that with that ball that 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.830
 there has been good luck because you are 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.550
 has complicated a little bit now this 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.550
 game to close 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.480
 so I pulled open cortadito 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.780
 'break' ball 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.320
 and yells again desperate stanislaw 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.320
 to jump 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.050
 one hour and forty-four minutes 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.530
 attentive rafa in case that entrance ball 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.070
 second match ball for the of 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.870
 manacor when with someone like that not to go down 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.640
 neither do you intensity because if you do not 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.620
 you end up getting into those silly mistakes 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.560
 not forced and you can start 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.360
 unintentionally complicate it is better to keep 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.840
 well the concentration and tension in the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.840
 match 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.509
 the stroke of eleven at night 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.509
 shanghai 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.690
 buenos aires then be party 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:57.100
 let's wait has asked the entity 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.790
 factory 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.790
 but good is 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.440
 If I had not asked for it 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.590
 I wanted to shine 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:39.990
 now yes what he had said before 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:44.190
 Rafael Nadal victory 2 set to 0 76 in 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.080
 the first with one hour and 13 minutes is 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.590
 it came down demoralized good 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.720
 it was really rafa who demoralized 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.230
 factory 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.639
 and in this second set the partial plus 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:00.050
 clear for the record player 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:04.780
 61 total 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.780
 one hour and 45 minutes
