obviously the heritage history that gave
back<00:00:19.929> to<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.800> know<00:00:20.920> the<00:00:21.099> 80s<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:21.759> the<00:00:22.119> 5-stone

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
back to you know the 80s and the 5-stone

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.450 
back to you know the 80s and the 5-stone
their<00:00:22.779> magic<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:23.349> Audi<00:00:23.740> absolutely<00:00:24.279> under

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
their magic that Audi absolutely under

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.900 
their magic that Audi absolutely under
display<00:00:24.699> World<00:00:25.119> Rally<00:00:25.390> Championship<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
display World Rally Championship and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.849 
display World Rally Championship and
then<00:00:28.150> on<00:00:28.300> into<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.779> American<00:00:29.169> scene<00:00:29.410> with<00:00:29.679> the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
then on into the American scene with the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.760 
then on into the American scene with the
Trans<00:00:30.189> Am<00:00:30.339> cars<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.060> m2<00:00:31.359> GTO<00:00:31.720> cars<00:00:32.079> and<00:00:32.650> then

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
Trans Am cars the m2 GTO cars and then

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.950 
Trans Am cars the m2 GTO cars and then
that<00:00:32.920> kind<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.160> died<00:00:33.340> off<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.790> I<00:00:34.480> think

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
that kind of died off and I think

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.720 
that kind of died off and I think
there's<00:00:35.079> a<00:00:35.110> generation<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.650> people<00:00:35.829> who<00:00:36.219> don't

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
there's a generation of people who don't

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.639 
there's a generation of people who don't
know<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.300> heritage<00:00:37.600> in<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.930> past<00:00:38.140> owner<00:00:38.410> so

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
know that heritage in the past owner so

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.810 
know that heritage in the past owner so
it<00:00:38.829> was<00:00:38.920> really<00:00:39.070> exciting<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.520> have<00:00:39.640> this

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
it was really exciting to have this

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.459 
it was really exciting to have this
opportunity<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.660> create<00:00:40.870> something<00:00:41.289> we<00:00:41.350> think

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
opportunity to create something we think

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.819 
opportunity to create something we think
is<00:00:41.559> really<00:00:41.680> special<00:00:43.350> we've<00:00:44.350> been<00:00:44.469> working

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
is really special we've been working

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.080 
is really special we've been working
about<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.980> year<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.370> half<00:00:45.579> on<00:00:45.910> the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
about a year and a half on the

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.779 
about a year and a half on the
development<00:00:46.629> of<00:00:46.899> this<00:00:47.140> kit<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:48.039> spatial

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
development of this kit the spatial

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.220 
development of this kit the spatial
constraints<00:00:49.329> inside<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.870> they're<00:00:50.019> tighter

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
constraints inside it they're tighter

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.660 
constraints inside it they're tighter
than<00:00:50.440> any<00:00:50.620> other<00:00:50.800> intubating<00:00:51.399> we've<00:00:51.489> ever

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
than any other intubating we've ever

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.430 
than any other intubating we've ever
worked<00:00:51.879> with<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.690> tolerances<00:00:53.109> are<00:00:53.289> very

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
worked with so the tolerances are very

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.490 
worked with so the tolerances are very
tight<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:54.219> with<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.609> comes<00:00:54.879> heat<00:00:55.570> issues<00:00:55.870> so

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
tight and with that comes heat issues so

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.779 
tight and with that comes heat issues so
one<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.679> the<00:00:56.769> final<00:00:57.010> things<00:00:57.129> we<00:00:57.280> were<00:00:57.340> doing<00:00:57.399> is

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
one of the final things we were doing is

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.630 
one of the final things we were doing is
we<00:00:57.940> were<00:00:57.969> testing<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.899> heat<00:00:59.140> aspects<00:01:00.129> related

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
we were testing the heat aspects related

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:44.109 
we were testing the heat aspects related
to<00:01:00.670> all<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.719> other<00:01:01.750> periphery<00:01:02.320> pieces<00:01:02.829> there

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.609 

part<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> fun<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.539> think<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> TT<00:01:46.229> RS<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
part of the fun I think the TT RS is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
part of the fun I think the TT RS is
it's<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> car<00:01:47.850> something<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it's going to be a car something is this

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
it's going to be a car something is this
kit<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.560> few<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:50.009> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
kit there will be very few thing that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.950 
kit there will be very few thing that
would<00:01:50.549> ever<00:01:50.579> run<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:50.939> against<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> track

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
would ever run up against on a track

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.130 
would ever run up against on a track
event<00:01:52.289> then<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.979> couldn't<00:01:53.280> easily<00:01:53.520> dispatch

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
event then they couldn't easily dispatch

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.789 
event then they couldn't easily dispatch
ran<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.320> day

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
ran all day

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
good Alabama July heat and had no issues

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.179 
good Alabama July heat and had no issues
whatsoever<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.179> it<00:02:00.539> was<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> good<00:02:01.470> day<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.100> of
