this<00:01:08.790> looks<00:01:09.060> an<00:01:09.150> awful<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.630> better<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this looks an awful lot better in the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.539 
this looks an awful lot better in the
metal<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> does<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> pictures<00:01:11.490> we

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
metal than it does in the pictures we

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.130 
metal than it does in the pictures we
weren't<00:01:11.790> quite<00:01:11.880> sure<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.270> proportions<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
weren't quite sure the proportions but I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
weren't quite sure the proportions but I
think<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> looks<00:01:13.650> brilliant

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
think it looks brilliant

think it looks brilliant
it's<00:01:14.610> obviously<00:01:14.909> quite<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> step<00:01:15.600> away<00:01:15.750> from

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's obviously quite a step away from

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and it's just higher than you expect

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
you can travel up to 31 miles in purely

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.280 
you can travel up to 31 miles in purely
electric<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.400> 277<00:01:47.270> miles<00:01:47.630> an<00:01:47.840> hour<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.170> the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
electric and 277 miles an hour on the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.050 
electric and 277 miles an hour on the
electric<00:01:48.590> enrollment<00:01:49.100> we've<00:01:49.640> got<00:01:49.790> three

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
electric enrollment we've got three

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.880 
electric enrollment we've got three
driving<00:01:50.450> modes<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.080> you've<00:01:51.260> got<00:01:51.440> full<00:01:51.619> hybrid

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
driving modes so you've got full hybrid

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.980 
driving modes so you've got full hybrid
then<00:01:52.640> you've<00:01:52.760> got<00:01:52.909> thermal<00:01:53.180> which<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.690> just

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
then you've got thermal which is just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630 
then you've got thermal which is just
the<00:01:54.110> beaten<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:54.920> you've<00:01:55.100> got<00:01:55.280> electric

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
the beaten and then you've got electric

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.830 
the beaten and then you've got electric
which<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:55.880> obviously<00:01:56.150> just<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.450> electric

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
which is obviously just the electric

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.350 
which is obviously just the electric
there<00:01:57.440> are<00:01:57.500> three<00:01:57.650> motors<00:01:58.010> as<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.190> say<00:01:58.369> one<00:01:59.240> is

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
there are three motors as I say one is

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.120 
there are three motors as I say one is
between<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.780> engine<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.170> gearbox<00:02:00.650> which<00:02:01.009> is

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
between the engine and gearbox which is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.560 
between the engine and gearbox which is
mounted<00:02:01.280> back<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:02.119> you've<00:02:02.210> got<00:02:02.360> two

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
mounted back and then you've got two

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.660 
mounted back and then you've got two
electric<00:02:03.050> motors<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.320> front<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.400> can

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
electric motors in front so you can

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.600 
electric motors in front so you can
potentially<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.860> long<00:02:06.860> drive<00:02:07.040> electric

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
potentially have a long drive electric

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.630 
potentially have a long drive electric
Lamborghini<00:02:09.190> obviously<00:02:10.190> there<00:02:10.310> are<00:02:10.429> some

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
Lamborghini obviously there are some

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.220 
Lamborghini obviously there are some
downsides<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.390> fact<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.630> it's<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.870> hybrid

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
downsides to the fact that it's a hybrid

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.400 
downsides to the fact that it's a hybrid
for<00:02:13.220> starters<00:02:13.580> next<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.970> 250<00:02:14.780> kilos<00:02:15.140> although

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
for starters next to 250 kilos although

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.660 
for starters next to 250 kilos although
they've<00:02:15.560> kept<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.100> sort<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> central

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
they've kept that in the sort of central

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.070 
they've kept that in the sort of central
spine<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.209> chassis<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.930> weight

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
spine of the chassis the weight

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.110 
spine of the chassis the weight
distribution<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.890> kept<00:02:19.160> relatively<00:02:19.760> sort<00:02:20.060> of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
even across from the car because

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.320 
even across from the car because
although<00:02:21.890> you've<00:02:22.130> got<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.489> electric<00:02:23.000> motors

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
although you've got the electric motors

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.300 
although you've got the electric motors
and<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.510> front<00:02:23.720> axle<00:02:24.170> they've<00:02:24.800> then<00:02:24.980> put<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
and the front axle they've then put the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.250 
and the front axle they've then put the
gearbox<00:02:25.670> behind<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> engine<00:02:26.269> back<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.930> do<00:02:27.080> it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
gearbox behind the engine back to do it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.670 
gearbox behind the engine back to do it
so<00:02:28.100> fairly<00:02:28.489> even<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.780> ultimately<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.440> very

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
so fairly even it's ultimately a very

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
so fairly even it's ultimately a very
very<00:02:31.190> cool<00:02:31.400> concept<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.330> hope<00:02:32.450> that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
very cool concept and I just hope that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.810 
very cool concept and I just hope that
they<00:02:32.720> build<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.050> one<00:02:33.140> day<00:02:33.320> all<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.070> details<00:02:34.519> as

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
they build it one day all the details as

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.070 
they build it one day all the details as
you<00:02:34.880> would<00:02:35.150> expect<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.510> land<00:02:35.750> with<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.959> know

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
you would expect to land with you know

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.590 
you would expect to land with you know
