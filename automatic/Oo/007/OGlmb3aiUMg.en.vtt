00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.900
 samsung tv world today is about hd 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.820
 versus full hd and that can us 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.040
 Of course no one better explain than 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 ssangyong he is the product and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.310
 samsung marketing manager sincerely 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.770
 welcome that you are there 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 hello sunny why can you give us the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.640
 tell difference between uhd and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 full hd more the big difference 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.320
 is actually the resolution hd 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 tv a much higher resolution 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 as with a classic full hd 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.820
 TV 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 So you have crisp pictures 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 and you feel like one 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.350
 done 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.149
 ok so the resolution hd brings us 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 Of course a lot but the normal 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.450
 tv program what we have is yes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 a completely different resolution, then 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 not in this high resolution hd 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 then brings us the purchase of a hd 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.739
 TV's almost the same on everyone 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.489
 case because you can already only 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.829
 enjoy 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.750
 you can on netflix or amazon on 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.129
 several hundred hours only the material 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.870
 resort to the press of a button 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.800
 viewing with our smart tvs does that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.170
 quite simply 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.969
 and what the tv program is about 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.909
 can watch the show today 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.799
 on astra there are 2 demo channels where 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.470
 you can already see what tomorrow today 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.210
 will be realistic or is the forward- 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.490
 a very nice hd signal with nice 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.530
 demo clips and there is the customer 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.240
 Today he will look what he will soon 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.229
 maybe with other major channels 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.850
 a welcome god 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.229
 We also offer one like that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.119
 called update function 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.710
 that is conventional signals whether that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.530
 new blu rays or a normal tv 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 signal is turned off to hd 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.189
 I have another question that really 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.509
 very important because if you now 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.189
 full hd tv sees he already has 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.560
 a high resolution namely the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.110
 difference between the full hd and hd 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.450
 TV was still at all 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.860
 in any case because alone by the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.910
 four times higher resolution can be seen 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.250
 Immediately the difference 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.960
 the big difference comes when 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.520
 you look at the trend and look at it 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.410
 screens are getting bigger 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.300
 living rooms will stay the same 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.950
 not grow with and watch the 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.440
 very relevant , you buy today in the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.600
 big tv and be it a full hd 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.070
 or hd ready tv then you see 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.660
 Immediately a pixelated picture because 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.640
 Normally the seat distance remains yes 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.930
 the same but the screen gets bigger 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 that can not happen to her 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.160
 due to the very high and sting 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.050
 sharp resolution remains 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.790
 Seating distance is the same and the picture 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.260
 just looks a lot better so 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.459
 means for me and for all customers 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.200
 probably for you too if I am 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.610
 buy me in the big hd tv 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.900
 I do not need my whole apartment 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.940
 change or maybe me a new one 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.560
 get a flat because the distance is the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.060
 same the tv gets bigger though 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.860
 I still have one right 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.850
 beautiful sharp picture ssangyong many 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.200
 Thank you very much for all that 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.600
 information now has too 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.860
 understood what uhd brings us and why 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.570
 I should go shopping 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.250
 I hope to see you again soon and 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.239
 Come home well 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.800
 that live 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.360
 let yourself be inspired by this 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.070

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.070
