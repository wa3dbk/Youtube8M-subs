 prevention of places to teeth with 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.710

 hope beautiful beautiful course hyper 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 technique for technicians it's 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.259
 really paradise there dptg it goes down 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 this world the big rock a lot of 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.020
 roots there were box holes after 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.520
 one kilometer we came with feet 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 wet management efficiency have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 not bad all the way through the uncertainty 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.990
 the end was really good then you 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 about injury prevention 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.550
 there is the potential for injury in this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.240
 meaning to be pretty clear I planted myself 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.330
 a couple of times fallen off this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 intrigue it's a very very good when we 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.440
 know we want to give it a rating 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.170
 can make sense to center it's 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.459
 good brison if you're very much 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 pikine and last years in the 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.140
 running but you started with 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.770
 the road then this year is actually 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.729
 an association with 1,805 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.200
 you and about 5 had organized the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.789
 first race the first edition of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.679
 the runner's clinic the hymn to the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.049
 the roofer's clinic is a great success 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.420
 a great success in one place 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.229
 beautiful lake beauport your course 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.910
 is appreciated despite the rain should 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.060
 we talk a little about the second edition 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 but when the second edition we go 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.459
 change the 10 km that will be 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.140
 in the end we were twice 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.849
 loop of 5 last year then there we go 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.000
 get out a little bit of that was going to make a 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.890
 little more altitude to vary 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.660
 also the course 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.069
 the other little thing is that must 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.410
 that we discuss of course but 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.470
 I dream of one day to go for a ride 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.090
 of the lake beauport trail there is a beautiful 29 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.799
 that he pretty much does it all 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.150
 domestic Canadian trails makes that a 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.549
 day I think to come maybe 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.879
 this year we will see but fortunes 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.230
 convolute example but listen it's a 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.569
 beautiful playground 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.060
 I live there that I practice the 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.160
 all the time there felt Canadian and at 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.470
 the nice thing to be and the beautiful 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.330
 I think we are in a site 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.640
 exceptional as the seasonal 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.800
 we had nearly 700 registered the year 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.450
 past I expect all 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.310
 full bunch fake 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.480
 register right away because I 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.030
 think for next year it's going 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.440
 to be another success we have others 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.020
 partners who come to associate with 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.160
 we at the local level ie it 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.870
 are many people from Beauport Lake 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.210
 who also participates in this event 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.830
 which drains a lot of people from the lake 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.410
 beauport in addition to trailer from everywhere 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.880
 in Quebec and I am convinced that we 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.280
 to make an event an international day 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.050
 that very happy to be associated with 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.600
 horizon five for organizing this 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.080
 type of event with the ace you have 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.610
 start 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.330
 you can do a lot of trail running 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.920
 suite now organizes a very cause 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.330
 soon you will propose a 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.959
 conference on the ultra trail yeah and then 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.570
 ultimately 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.160
 you end up being a lot in the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.890
 world street and then like a lot of 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.570
 runners you lay the road to this guy 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.660
 shopping what do you think 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.820
 which makes people turn to 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.350
 this discipline we it is so me 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.260
 I started when I was younger 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.989
 I was doing the track does that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.400
 I trained in worse and after that I 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.189
 did the road race I got 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.750
 returned to the marathon to test it which 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.709
 is finally happy me what attracts me 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.090
 a lot in the trip it's not 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.930
 necessarily making and intel 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.209
 this is because drive 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.720
 I have a huge pleasure to run between 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.520
 they train me and then I 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.050
 lose the taste of making the stat 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.330
 but ultimately everyone each 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.030
 it is under these choices the important thing is 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.220
 run then actually it's some 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.680
 thing that is hyper exciting then you 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.979
 talked about the conference sometimes we do 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.919
 come 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.080
 guillaume millet who is a leading 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.410
 international community in research on 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.419
 on the trail that ends 3rd authors of 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.009
 jets a330 that he does not do anyone 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.199
 that will couple with all our 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.870
 local experience that is to say the porho 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.220
 and many other top riders 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.139
 level who will come to give their 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.150
 experience talking about all this because 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.180
 I think trail is something 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.610
 who is bubbling who who is going 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.229
 explode then if we take the few 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.880
 next few years I think everything 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.160
 old people like me there when you're there 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.169
 arrive at 40 ben ben they notice 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.419
 they hurt - lyon more fun 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.740
 then there is also all the energy is at 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.270
 very geek competition round is a 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.599
 little different from that of road is 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.820
 very fresh but we know very friendly 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.380
 less competitive even though we always 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.380
 a little bit of this challenge and all 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.530
 but me that 's what attracts me a lot 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.930
 children 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.610
 I think the trail in Quebec is worth 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.840
 do what happened in 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.300
 europe to say that it will take a 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.740
 flight that is phenomenal and in europe 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.930
 the percentages of shoes sales 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.330
 trail versus road shoes is in 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.000
 expansion but exponentially 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.440
 it's impressive and here we are 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.710
 little bit we're late compared to 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.870
 that is to say that we 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.610
 we begin to develop this expertise 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.110
 with you among others who took 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.630
 a lot of space in the area 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.880
 Quebec and other competitions that 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.640
 are attracting more and more people 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.740
 then I think it's for the leap 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.140
 runners it's going to be the fun rexel has 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.590
 does that risk you ben there 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.080
 tomorrow is the 21 km yes you have to go 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.250
 by that but especially the ultra trail 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.170
 harricana has the planned 65 kilometers that 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.750
 in your early season you got hurt 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.390
 the potting soil came quite strong enough 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.740
 finish 3rd national have today way 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.190
 just get started 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.570
 you expect uncle ultra at kana I 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.670
 am obliged to tell you that I lack 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.160
 of training I mostly miss 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.860
 week-end weekend break great weekend 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.840
 pilat at the end of the week we would have had a 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.730
 ankle problem a sprain in the end 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.080
 of account that drag pain and then 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.050
 I was forced to stop for 3 to 4 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.430
 weeks did that really put his 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.680
 scraped mama mama planning for 65 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.600
 I can not say I feel very 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.160
 really but with the race we have 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.770
 done today that is very demanding 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.480
 that I negotiated well that I measured well 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.070
 I was really very conservative at 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.770
 beginning then I managed to bounce back to the 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.390
 end as it takes me I think the 65 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.080
 will just take one more layer 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.790
 clever 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.370
 then we will do with the people we have 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.300
 with that I think aubenas thank you 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.300
 a lot more fun
