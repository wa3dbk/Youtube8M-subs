00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.610 

here<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.160> it's<00:00:08.460> how<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:09.080> number<00:00:10.080> nine<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
here we are it's how to number nine I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.860 
here we are it's how to number nine I
think<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.400> today<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.540> gonna<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.719> teaching

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
think and today I'm gonna be teaching

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.259 
think and today I'm gonna be teaching
you<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.410> backflip<00:00:14.160> no-hander<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.120> of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
you the backflip no-hander which is of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.140 
you the backflip no-hander which is of
course<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:16.039> more<00:00:17.039> technical<00:00:17.460> version<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
course a more technical version of the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840 
course a more technical version of the
backflip<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.320> single<00:00:20.070> no<00:00:20.189> hander<00:00:20.609> which

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
backflip and the single no hander which

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.200 
backflip and the single no hander which
I've<00:00:21.060> done<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.510> previous<00:00:21.869> how<00:00:22.230> to's<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.210> yeah

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I've done in previous how to's and yeah

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.570 
I've done in previous how to's and yeah
let's<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> little<00:00:25.019> look<00:00:25.230> how<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
let's have a little look how to do it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.549 
let's have a little look how to do it
then<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.899> want<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> approach<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
then so you want to approach the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
then so you want to approach the
take-off<00:00:34.950> about<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> same<00:00:36.059> speed<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
take-off about the same speed as the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.360 
take-off about the same speed as the
backflip<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:39.540> find<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
backflip then I find that you have to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639 
backflip then I find that you have to
spin<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.719> slower<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.410> when

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
spin a little bit slower because when

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.619 
spin a little bit slower because when
you<00:00:43.739> pull<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:43.980> bars<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:45.030> gonna<00:00:45.149> make

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you pull your bars in that's gonna make

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.889 
you pull your bars in that's gonna make
the<00:00:45.750> rotation<00:00:46.379> quicker<00:00:47.390> almost<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.539> soon<00:00:48.750> as

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the rotation quicker almost as soon as

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.180 
the rotation quicker almost as soon as
you<00:00:48.989> got<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.260> bars<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.739> want<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> get

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
you got your bars and you want to get

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
you got your bars and you want to get
them<00:00:50.309> hands<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.059> far<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
them hands out as far as you can and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.869 
them hands out as far as you can and
then<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> course<00:00:53.100> bring<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.399> back<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.730> as

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
then of course bring them back in as

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.479 
then of course bring them back in as
quick<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.210> possible<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.930> adjust<00:00:55.680> yourself<00:00:56.370> for

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
quick as possible to adjust yourself for

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
quick as possible to adjust yourself for
the<00:00:56.550> landing<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.510> you've<00:00:57.780> pulled<00:00:58.500> too<00:00:58.770> hard

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the landing if you've pulled too hard

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.439 
the landing if you've pulled too hard
and<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.489> hands<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.879> off<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> get

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and your hands are off you want to get

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.910 
and your hands are off you want to get
them<00:01:00.570> back<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.960> quick<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.260> possible<00:01:01.770> one

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
them back on as quick as possible one

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
them back on as quick as possible one
straight<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> right<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.270> slow<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.870> spin

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
straight and right out to slow your spin

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.429 
straight and right out to slow your spin
down<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:05.180> as<00:01:06.180> hard<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> might<00:01:06.960> look<00:01:07.200> it's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
down but as hard as it might look it's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
down but as hard as it might look it's
actually<00:01:07.560> probably<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> easier

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
actually probably one of the easier

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.539 
actually probably one of the easier
backflip<00:01:09.320> variations<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
backflip variations so let's have a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
backflip variations so let's have a
little<00:01:11.670> look<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> slow-mo<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.250> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
little look at it in slow-mo and that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:27.210 
little look at it in slow-mo and that
will<00:01:14.369> help<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.880> more

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.720 

so<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.250> recommend<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.570> use<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.950> kind<00:01:31.640> of

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
so I recommend that you use a kind of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.520 
so I recommend that you use a kind of
softer<00:01:32.180> landing<00:01:32.510> few<00:01:32.630> first<00:01:32.810> attempts<00:01:33.350> I

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
softer landing few first attempts I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.710 
softer landing few first attempts I
wouldn't<00:01:34.460> say<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:34.670> need<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.880> foam<00:01:35.150> pit<00:01:35.420> cuz

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
wouldn't say you need a foam pit cuz

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.710 
wouldn't say you need a foam pit cuz
it's<00:01:36.080> really<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:37.040> that<00:01:37.160> difficult<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:38.390> can

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
it's really not that difficult you can

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.660 
it's really not that difficult you can
get<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.710> nice<00:01:39.890> feeling<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.550> this

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
get the get the nice feeling of this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.700 
get the get the nice feeling of this
trick<00:01:40.970> by<00:01:41.240> just<00:01:41.540> doing<00:01:41.660> standard<00:01:42.200> backflips

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
trick by just doing standard backflips

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.590 
trick by just doing standard backflips
and<00:01:42.950> maybe<00:01:43.280> pulling<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.730> bars<00:01:43.940> in<00:01:44.180> towards

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
and maybe pulling the bars in towards

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.240 
and maybe pulling the bars in towards
you<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.290> getting<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.680> rested<00:01:46.040> in<00:01:46.130> your

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you you know getting it rested in your

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.180 
you you know getting it rested in your
lap<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:47.840> really<00:01:48.170> probably<00:01:48.860> going<00:01:49.130> to

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
lap but it's really probably going to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.190 
lap but it's really probably going to
work<00:01:49.310> first<00:01:49.700> going<00:01:50.030> once<00:01:50.180> you've<00:01:50.330> commit<00:01:50.750> so

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
work first going once you've commit so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.190 
work first going once you've commit so
yeah<00:01:52.160> just<00:01:52.400> bang<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:52.970> right<00:01:53.330> out<00:01:53.540> on<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.810> jumps

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
yeah just bang it right out on the jumps

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.140 
yeah just bang it right out on the jumps
first<00:01:54.410> go<00:01:54.620> on<00:01:54.770> say<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.860> main<00:02:01.340> steps<00:02:01.790> then

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
first go on say so the main steps then

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.020 
first go on say so the main steps then
to<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.420> trick<00:02:02.690> let's<00:02:03.410> go<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.710> same<00:02:03.950> speed<00:02:04.460> as

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
to the trick let's go the same speed as

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.740 
to the trick let's go the same speed as
a<00:02:05.090> normal<00:02:05.540> flip<00:02:06.040> then<00:02:07.040> don't<00:02:07.790> pull<00:02:08.090> as<00:02:08.240> hard<00:02:08.270> as

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
a normal flip then don't pull as hard as

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.449 
a normal flip then don't pull as hard as
a<00:02:08.780> normal<00:02:09.140> flip<00:02:09.290> on<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> take-off<00:02:09.979> because

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
a normal flip on the take-off because

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.730 
a normal flip on the take-off because
when<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:10.940> pull<00:02:11.630> your<00:02:11.660> bars<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.440> get<00:02:12.620> your

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
when you pull your bars in to get your

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.930 
when you pull your bars in to get your
hands<00:02:13.070> off<00:02:13.190> you're<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.550> spin<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> bit

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
hands off you're going to spin a bit

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.120 
hands off you're going to spin a bit
quicker<00:02:14.120> then<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.990> want<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.260> get<00:02:15.800> make<00:02:16.100> sure
