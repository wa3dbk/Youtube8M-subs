00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
that was released on the PC side just

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.769 
that was released on the PC side just
last<00:00:25.380> week<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.340> seems<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> patch<00:00:27.269> turns

last week it seems that the patch turns

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.279 
last week it seems that the patch turns
on<00:00:28.670> mouse<00:00:29.670> acceleration<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.810> turns<00:00:31.050> off<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
on mouse acceleration and turns off the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.000 
on mouse acceleration and turns off the
raw<00:00:31.669> input<00:00:32.669> even<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> selected

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
raw input even if you have it selected

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.670 
raw input even if you have it selected
within<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.820> in-game<00:00:36.270> main<00:00:36.630> menu<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> today<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
within the in-game main menu and today I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979 
within the in-game main menu and today I
wanted<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> bring<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> video<00:00:38.629> showing<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.809> how

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
wanted to bring a video showing you how

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
wanted to bring a video showing you how
to<00:00:40.230> turn<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.670> don't<00:00:41.820> know

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to turn that off if you don't know

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.670 
to turn that off if you don't know
already<00:00:42.270> mouse<00:00:42.540> acceleration<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.350> basically

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
already mouse acceleration is basically

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440 
already mouse acceleration is basically
software<00:00:43.950> built<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.879> operating

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
software built into your operating

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
software built into your operating
system<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.320> compensate<00:00:46.620> or

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
system that can compensate or

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.190 
system that can compensate or
overcompensate<00:00:47.940> your<00:00:48.149> mouse<00:00:48.360> movements<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
overcompensate your mouse movements and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
overcompensate your mouse movements and
really<00:00:49.500> throw<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:49.890> aim<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
really throw off your aim it can be a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
really throw off your aim it can be a
quite<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> detriment<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.410> playing<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
quite a detriment when you're playing a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
quite a detriment when you're playing a
first-person<00:00:53.129> shooter<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.879> mouse<00:00:54.120> and

first-person shooter with a mouse and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
first-person shooter with a mouse and
keyboard<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:55.020> main<00:00:55.199> input<00:00:55.620> control

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
basically how you can change it within

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
basically how you can change it within

list of programs that you can use to
open<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> WordPad<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> best<00:01:18.780> one<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> keeps

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
all the lines of code organized or

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.609 
all the lines of code organized or
basically<00:01:22.560> gonna<00:01:22.710> alter<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:24.180> save<00:01:24.990> lines<00:01:25.320> in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
basically gonna alter to save lines in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
basically gonna alter to save lines in
here<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> they're<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:26.850> simple<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.360> want

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
here and they're really simple we want

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.910 
here and they're really simple we want
to<00:01:27.570> look<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.900> GST<00:01:28.909> input<00:01:29.909> dot<00:01:30.450> scheme<00:01:30.990> zero

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
to look for GST input dot scheme zero

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
to look for GST input dot scheme zero
sensitivity<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:34.079> one<00:01:34.290> would<00:01:34.470> be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
sensitivity so the first one would be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
sensitivity so the first one would be
basically<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.479> one

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
basically right here is the first one

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.140 
basically right here is the first one
we're<00:01:36.720> gonna<00:01:36.810> edit<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.890> say<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.579> point

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we're gonna edit it would say one point

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.420 
we're gonna edit it would say one point
and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.990> you'd<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.290> basically<00:01:40.770> six<00:01:41.070> zeros

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and then you'd have basically six zeros

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
and then you'd have basically six zeros
after<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> we're<00:01:42.150> gonna<00:01:42.270> change<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.899> one

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
after it we're gonna change that one

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.389 
after it we're gonna change that one
right<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> zero<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.799> second<00:01:47.220> line

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
right there to a zero the second line

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.210 
right there to a zero the second line
that<00:01:47.579> we're<00:01:47.790> gonna<00:01:47.939> alter<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.590> GST

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that we're gonna alter is right here GST

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.810 
that we're gonna alter is right here GST
input<00:01:50.759> scheme<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:52.250> sensitivity<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.670> gonna

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
input scheme one sensitivity it's gonna

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.510 
input scheme one sensitivity it's gonna
have<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> same<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.810> point<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.860> six<00:01:56.189> zeros

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
have the same one point with six zeros

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450 
have the same one point with six zeros
behind<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.210> we're<00:01:57.689> gonna<00:01:57.780> change<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
behind it we're gonna change that to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.240 
behind it we're gonna change that to
zero<00:01:59.759> as<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.659> basically<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:01.920> there

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
zero as well and basically right there

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.330 
zero as well and basically right there
I've<00:02:02.579> turned<00:02:03.210> off<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.960> mouse<00:02:04.890> acceleration

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I've turned off all mouse acceleration
