my<00:02:29.320> sim<00:02:29.650> card<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.190> side<00:02:30.490> here<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:36.520> we'll

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
my sim card in the side here so we'll

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.910 
my sim card in the side here so we'll
just<00:02:36.640> power<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.090> up<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.290> we'll<00:02:38.410> see<00:02:38.620> what<00:02:38.770> it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
just power it up and we'll see what it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.380 
just power it up and we'll see what it's
like<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:39.220> one<00:02:39.370> thing<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.550> has<00:02:39.790> surprised<00:02:40.300> me

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
like now one thing that has surprised me

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.360 
like now one thing that has surprised me
is<00:02:43.390> how<00:02:43.750> good<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.080> feels<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.560> hand<00:02:44.830> for<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> cheap

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
is how good it feels in hand for a cheap

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.070 
is how good it feels in hand for a cheap
device<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.090> mean<00:02:46.330> when<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.540> consider<00:02:46.930> what

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
device I mean when you consider what

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.800 
device I mean when you consider what
other<00:02:47.410> handsets<00:02:47.920> are<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:49.450> costs<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
other handsets are like that costs the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.330 
other handsets are like that costs the
similar<00:02:50.260> amount<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.450> rather<00:02:52.780> good<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.380> feel

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
similar amount it is rather good I feel

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.370 
similar amount it is rather good I feel
solid<00:02:54.850> there's<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> nice<00:02:55.330> curve<00:02:55.690> back<00:02:55.990> on<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.260> so

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
solid there's a nice curve back on it so

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.560 
solid there's a nice curve back on it so
it<00:02:56.500> feels<00:02:56.710> nice<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.040> your<00:02:57.340> hand<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:58.210> does<00:02:58.390> not

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it feels nice in your hand it does not

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.740 
it feels nice in your hand it does not
feel<00:02:58.840> cheap<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.680> slightest<00:03:00.510> by<00:03:01.510> guessing

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
feel cheap in the slightest by guessing

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.480 
feel cheap in the slightest by guessing
the<00:03:02.050> performance<00:03:02.650> area<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.160> where<00:03:03.340> we're

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
the performance area is where we're

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.980 
the performance area is where we're
going<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.670> find<00:03:03.910> out<00:03:04.120> what<00:03:04.390> it's<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.750> and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
going to find out what it's like and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.810 
going to find out what it's like and
that<00:03:05.140> will<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.500> come<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.040> later<00:03:06.340> review

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
that will have to come in a later review

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.700 
that will have to come in a later review
but<00:03:07.450> from<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.840> early<00:03:08.110> impressions<00:03:08.590> the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
but from just early impressions the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.820 
but from just early impressions the
screen<00:03:09.070> is<00:03:09.250> really<00:03:09.490> sharp<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> 329<00:03:10.960> pixels

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
screen is really sharp as a 329 pixels

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.460 
screen is really sharp as a 329 pixels
per<00:03:12.010> inch<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:13.390> terms<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.720> resolution<00:03:14.350> you're

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
per inch in terms of resolution you're

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.010 
per inch in terms of resolution you're
looking<00:03:14.740> at<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> standard<00:03:15.580> HD<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.239> 1280<00:03:16.900> by<00:03:17.800> 720

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
looking at a standard HD so 1280 by 720

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.510 
looking at a standard HD so 1280 by 720
so<00:03:20.020> here<00:03:20.170> we<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.410> first<00:03:20.830> look<00:03:21.130> at<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
so here we have a first look at the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.920 
so here we have a first look at the
device<00:03:21.820> actually<00:03:22.090> up<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.540> running<00:03:22.600> you'll

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
device actually up and running you'll

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.260 
device actually up and running you'll
see<00:03:23.110> there<00:03:23.320> are<00:03:23.440> tons<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.890> things<00:03:24.250> waiting<00:03:24.970> for

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
see there are tons of things waiting for

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.050 
see there are tons of things waiting for
me<00:03:25.480> here<00:03:25.780> all<00:03:26.650> sorts<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.070> our<00:03:27.220> messages<00:03:27.850> from

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
me here all sorts of our messages from

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.460 
me here all sorts of our messages from
signing<00:03:28.510> in<00:03:28.600> but<00:03:28.780> I'll<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.020> look<00:03:29.170> at<00:03:29.290> those

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
signing in but I'll have a look at those

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.520 
signing in but I'll have a look at those
again<00:03:30.100> later<00:03:30.370> now<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:31.390> moving<00:03:31.870> from<00:03:32.170> screen

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
