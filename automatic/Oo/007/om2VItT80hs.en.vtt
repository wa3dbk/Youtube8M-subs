00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
slow it seems really hard if you just

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.669 
slow it seems really hard if you just
get<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.659> there<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.840> go<00:01:16.929> fast<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.350> tuck<00:01:17.530> it

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
right into your water you are so if your

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.109 
right into your water you are so if your
buoyancy<00:01:21.009> is<00:01:21.399> if<00:01:21.700> you're<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:21.909> trial<00:01:22.090> with

problem<00:01:24.280> sometimes<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.359> you<00:01:25.570> do<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.899> too<00:01:26.020> slow

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
problem sometimes if you do it too slow

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.609 
problem sometimes if you do it too slow
you'll<00:01:26.530> start<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.859> roll<00:01:27.039> over<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.630> it's<00:01:28.929> fast

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
you'll start to roll over so it's fast

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.149 
you'll start to roll over so it's fast
motion<00:01:30.189> don't<00:01:30.909> give<00:01:31.240> all<00:01:31.420> three<00:01:31.719> of<00:01:31.810> these<00:01:32.159> all

motion don't give all three of these all
three<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.700> depends<00:01:33.969> on<00:01:34.030> what<00:01:34.179> I'm<00:01:34.270> fishing<00:01:34.450> if

I<00:01:36.219> might<00:01:36.369> only<00:01:36.490> just<00:01:36.789> string<00:01:37.030> one<00:01:37.179> band<00:01:37.420> and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
I might only just string one band and
