00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.809
 Mean here with another gameplay 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.700
 Comment II and so I have one today 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.259
 small team deathmatch on the map wmd 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.720
 for you the whole has again 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.669
 relatively high score 467 text him there'd 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 I think somehow it was about the fils 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.789
 and then you have to later in the title song for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.279
 end of the video look 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.899
 yes that gives to say what is it about what 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.059
 it is today today it is about one 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.040
 black ops 2 information quite important 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.440
 Information that some people will find 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.769
 eagerly waiting for it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.969
 and yes I come from directional topic 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.379
 because I do not want gameplay 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.360
 Comment again so do but one 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.760
 year on topic topic quasi one 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.760
 information pays and indeed it is today 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.379
 to the by post and the largest yes 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.479
 pretty much duisburg now in black 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.969
 ops has been faithful to his war 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.260
 I in q4 at that time received this belief 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.180
 I'm still drunk 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.100
 I have in my head also thrones 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.770
 StÃ¶rer was exactly the same birk and then 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.810
 it was called to quasi 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.119
 I do not know if ice cold wrestles in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.619
 mw2 and then stop known and now as 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.079
 It's not too strong in and around 245 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.729
 because you can do it with firepower so to speak 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.500
 each of the firepower or juggernaut 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.049
 now in the even older parts and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.790
 that's why there are not that many 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.399
 people used ice cold because that is 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.880
 were relatively strong and that 's just in 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.650
 black ops no longer been the case 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.680
 rostock with distance the strongest birkin 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.140
 the one in the class and was also very 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.580
 used a lot and that really has some 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 people pretty excited for that 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.380
 pirker tulkarem stressed because I too 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.360
 one myself and a couple of times 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.460
 annoyed because people just do not wake up 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.850
 I have july when then fought and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.700
 kate and so on and troy aqua 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.799
 aware that some people are stressed 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.990
 has and david from the hatz via twitter 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.760
 said that must of course 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.979
 will be completely honest 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.260
 that can also be used positively 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.590
 without fighting and for that too 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.620
 finally there and without ghostwriter like so 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.510
 crass op that would be indescribable and from 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.670
 therefore, it is very clear ghost is still in 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.090
 every cod in the next cds too 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.409
 be included and therefore they have 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.280
 now all this bit too 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.810
 shine 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.370
 and I think I can do quite well 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.780
 and how she did it 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.530
 I just have to ask at times 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.269
 to explain 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.430
 So he wrote that he knows 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.310
 gold is a relatively strong castle 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.830
 and most of his his 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.739
 yes, its superior to its category is what 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.390
 actually that was the case and from 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.849
 so he just said that now 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.150
 court will unlock very late 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.380
 So apparently a very high level 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.390
 30 to be able to hold it already starts 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.040
 at times 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.840
 yes, if you have that we prestige quasi 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.400
 can take over with you or you then 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.810
 I have to start again from scratch 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.880
 I can not tell you now 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.019
 Anyway , it gets very late in the game 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.790
 be unlockable 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.360
 however, we still have that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.269
 problem with july like the relative 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.450
 strong is the op and that will be too 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.030
 bit weakened the iv and that 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.739
 by never stopping like me 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.840
 now understood to fly lower 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.090
 does not leave for those who do not 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.500
 know the uefi circles almost on the map 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.150
 and why exactly how a job at Ghana 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.370
 only it is significantly higher and clearer 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.989
 smaller 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.690
 about a whole magazine right now 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.700
 a july like to shoot down 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.620
 because you do not hit all the balls all 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.190
 balls so I believe a magazine skin 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.790
 completely 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.470
 shoot down for the juwi and yes man 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.299
 is supposed to play runs now 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.859
 can and indeed needs less 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.540
 balls and she is running the visible 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.609
 and by that I think lower 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.980
 At least I think I would fly 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.109
 taken from the text of twitter 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.049
 I want to change my mind 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.420
 and yes so so a stop which is also a 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.319
 be toned down a bit 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.150
 and that is actually quite 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.810
 forgets is toned down which becomes 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.609
 attenuated 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.150
 yes, well, somehow again 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.260
 neutral point I do not know though 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.120
 that's probably quite fair 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.459
 on I think it's good that you only greet 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.989
 So late unlocks the newcomers 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.519
 can then just a corner 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.049
 pure mold that will not work anymore 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.209
 they also have to learn to play 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.000
 I think that's just fine and yahoo 's 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.799
 truth was relatively strong too 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080
 get points for scores wars 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.760
 if you shoot in july, if that is now 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.560
 more is like a normal keel 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.700
 or less , unfortunately I do not know that 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.870
 Of course, it is not known yet 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.020
 no one is at the moment except 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.250
 maybe a few 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.060
 where was I think even that is 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.680
 do not really pick it up again and 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.840
 In any case, we'll write your own 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.250
 opinion in the comments finds 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.020
 her that came that way is now so with it 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.640
 done or find you are missing there always 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.470
 something else has to be fired 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.840
 Restore it so that you stop it 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.640
 can weaken where anyway only 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.020
 still 42 was or you say ne na.de 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.970
 sounds quite good 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.640
 let's see in what category ghost 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.020
 is such an example that I already know 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.330
 In any case, the gameplay is over 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.040
 the 125 you have experienced the video gives 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.150
 also ask thumb up to 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.150
 next time charlotte
