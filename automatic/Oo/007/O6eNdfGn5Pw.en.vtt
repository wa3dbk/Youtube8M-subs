it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.520> great<00:01:59.729> thickening<00:02:00.540> agent<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.020> let's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it's a great thickening agent so let's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
it's a great thickening agent so let's
say<00:02:01.649> you're<00:02:01.920> trying<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.700> Thanksgiving

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
gravy and you want to thicken the gravy

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.680 
gravy and you want to thicken the gravy
but<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.140> gluten

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690

but you don't want to have gluten
in<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.229> you're<00:02:08.320> not<00:02:08.410> going<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.650> use<00:02:08.740> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
in it so you're not going to use the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.650 
in it so you're not going to use the
flowers<00:02:09.190> maybe<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.119> can<00:02:10.210> do<00:02:10.390> is

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
flowers maybe that what you can do is

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.050 
flowers maybe that what you can do is
use<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.020> tapioca<00:02:11.500> flour<00:02:11.650> instead<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.640> then

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
use the tapioca flour instead and then

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.630 
use the tapioca flour instead and then
you're<00:02:13.270> gluten<00:02:14.050> allergic<00:02:14.710> cousin<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.490> not

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
you're gluten allergic cousin is not
