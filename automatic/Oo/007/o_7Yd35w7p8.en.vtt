00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
watched an exam Matic that I made for

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.590 
watched an exam Matic that I made for
this<00:04:28.880> map<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.810> did<00:04:30.110> over<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.980> course<00:04:31.220> of

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
this map that I did over the course of

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.240 
this map that I did over the course of
one<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.780> two<00:04:32.930> weeks<00:04:33.110> though<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.830> episode<00:04:34.220> that

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
one to two weeks though the episode that

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.560 
one to two weeks though the episode that
and<00:04:34.580> did<00:04:35.120> get<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.420> little<00:04:36.010> spread<00:04:37.010> apart<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:38.180> I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
and did get a little spread apart so I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.840 
and did get a little spread apart so I
just<00:04:39.410> quickly<00:04:39.590> finished<00:04:40.040> everything<00:04:40.340> up<00:04:40.640> I

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
just quickly finished everything up I

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.280 
just quickly finished everything up I
didn't<00:04:41.210> show<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.420> last<00:04:41.630> minute<00:04:41.870> building

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
didn't show the last minute building

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.370 
didn't show the last minute building
which<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.650> added<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:44.030> house<00:04:44.300> over<00:04:44.720> here<00:04:44.750> as

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
which I added this house over here as

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.260 
which I added this house over here as
well<00:04:45.770> as<00:04:47.440> maybe<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:49.070> or<00:04:49.190> two<00:04:49.310> things<00:04:49.520> but<00:04:50.210> I'm

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
well as maybe one or two things but I'm

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.350 
well as maybe one or two things but I'm
not<00:04:50.390> gonna<00:04:50.510> be<00:04:50.690> talking<00:04:51.080> about<00:04:51.170> that<00:04:51.560> so

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
not gonna be talking about that so

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.970 
not gonna be talking about that so
obviously<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.450> have<00:04:54.020> basically<00:04:54.440> finished<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
obviously I have basically finished the

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.970 
obviously I have basically finished the
map<00:04:55.490> as<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.330> did<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.600> cinematic<00:04:57.200> now<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.830> do

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
map as I did the cinematic now I do

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.150 
map as I did the cinematic now I do
apologize<00:04:58.700> that<00:04:58.730> there<00:04:59.210> is<00:04:59.420> a<00:04:59.450> bit<00:04:59.870> of

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
apologize that there is a bit of

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.090 
apologize that there is a bit of
framerate<00:05:01.160> issues<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:03.110> lighting<00:05:03.500> glitches

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
framerate issues like lighting glitches

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.720 
framerate issues like lighting glitches
but<00:05:05.590> personally<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.650> don't<00:05:06.680> have<00:05:06.950> that<00:05:07.100> great

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
but personally I don't have that great

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.610 
but personally I don't have that great
of<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:08.030> computer<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:10.700> shaders<00:05:11.240> were<00:05:11.620> not

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
of a computer so the shaders were not

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.250 
of a computer so the shaders were not
that<00:05:12.860> great<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.880> frame<00:05:17.300> rates<00:05:17.540> I'm<00:05:18.020> still

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
that great and the frame rates I'm still

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.960 
that great and the frame rates I'm still
messing<00:05:18.440> around<00:05:18.650> with<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:18.860> basically<00:05:19.730> what

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
messing around with that basically what

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.870 
messing around with that basically what
I<00:05:20.000> did<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.390> um<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:21.169> use<00:05:21.560> camstudio<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.820> I

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
I did is um I use camstudio and I

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.520 
I did is um I use camstudio and I
basically<00:05:23.390> did<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:23.990> really<00:05:24.380> slow<00:05:25.990> turn<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.320> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
basically did a really slow turn of the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.200 
basically did a really slow turn of the
island<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:29.419> basically<00:05:30.380> maybe<00:05:31.040> did<00:05:31.250> 30<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.910> 40

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
island so I basically maybe did 30 to 40

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.470 
island so I basically maybe did 30 to 40
minutes<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:32.780> captured<00:05:33.560> that<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:33.770> sped<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.370> up

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
minutes I captured that and sped it up

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.180 
minutes I captured that and sped it up
in<00:05:35.480> post<00:05:35.840> editing<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:36.680> created<00:05:37.100> the

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
in post editing and created the

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.760 
in post editing and created the
cinematic<00:05:37.760> but<00:05:38.419> there<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.750> bits<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.290> sped

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
cinematic but there is bits that I sped

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.190 
cinematic but there is bits that I sped
in<00:05:39.950> I<00:05:40.220> mean<00:05:40.850> I<00:05:40.880> didn't<00:05:41.240> speed<00:05:41.450> up<00:05:41.570> as<00:05:41.690> much<00:05:41.930> so

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
in I mean I didn't speed up as much so

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.480 
in I mean I didn't speed up as much so
it<00:05:42.410> was<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.620> little<00:05:42.800> bit<00:05:42.980> of<00:05:43.070> framing<00:05:43.400> issues

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
it was a little bit of framing issues

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.730 
it was a little bit of framing issues
but<00:05:44.419> hopefully<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.020> will<00:05:45.200> be<00:05:45.230> able<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.530> test

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
but hopefully I will be able to test

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.220 
but hopefully I will be able to test
with<00:05:46.100> that<00:05:46.280> in<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.550> future<00:05:46.750> maps<00:05:47.750> that<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.080> do

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
with that in the future maps that I do

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.010 
with that in the future maps that I do
for<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.860> cinematics<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.900> hopefully<00:05:50.900> I<00:05:50.960> can

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
for the cinematics and hopefully I can

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.530 
for the cinematics and hopefully I can
find<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.650> better<00:05:51.770> shader<00:05:52.250> pack<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.970> doesn't

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
find a better shader pack that doesn't

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.140 
find a better shader pack that doesn't
have<00:05:53.690> this<00:05:53.840> many<00:05:54.130> weird<00:05:55.130> glitches<00:05:55.640> now

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
have this many weird glitches now

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.670 
have this many weird glitches now
basically<00:05:56.390> what<00:05:56.840> I'm<00:05:56.990> looking<00:05:57.020> in<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.410> shader

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
basically what I'm looking in the shader

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.430 
basically what I'm looking in the shader
pack<00:05:57.890> is<00:05:58.070> just<00:05:58.300> cool<00:05:59.300> lens<00:05:59.660> flares<00:06:00.050> with

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
pack is just cool lens flares with

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.770 
pack is just cool lens flares with
shadows<00:06:01.250> and<00:06:01.970> that's<00:06:02.270> about<00:06:02.390> it<00:06:03.130> but<00:06:04.480> yeah<00:06:05.480> so

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
shadows and that's about it but yeah so

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.020 
shadows and that's about it but yeah so
just<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.620> little<00:06:06.830> bit<00:06:06.950> of<00:06:07.070> a<00:06:07.100> little<00:06:07.880> bit<00:06:08.000> of

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
just a little bit of a little bit of
