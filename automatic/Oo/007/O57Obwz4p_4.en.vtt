the same thing but for gopro cameras and
this<00:00:33.260> one<00:00:33.440> has<00:00:33.559> a<00:00:33.590> cool<00:00:33.980> over<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.670> shoulder

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
this one has a cool over the shoulder

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.270 
this one has a cool over the shoulder
thing<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:36.260> keep<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.680> little<00:00:36.830> bit<00:00:37.040> more

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
thing to keep it a little bit more

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.060 
thing to keep it a little bit more
steady<00:00:37.699> so<00:00:38.570> let's<00:00:38.720> get<00:00:38.809> started<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.770> parts

steady so let's get started the parts
you<00:00:40.190> will<00:00:40.309> need<00:00:40.519> are<00:00:40.790> all<00:00:41.000> half-inch<00:00:41.840> pieces

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
you will need are all half-inch pieces

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.939 
you will need are all half-inch pieces
of<00:00:42.500> PVC<00:00:42.650> pipe<00:00:43.220> this<00:00:44.090> is<00:00:44.360> 80<00:00:44.809> piece<00:00:45.110> with<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> flat

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
of PVC pipe this is 80 piece with a flat

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.240 
of PVC pipe this is 80 piece with a flat
go<00:00:46.309> proteus<00:00:46.820> amount<00:00:47.239> stuck<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:48.229> use<00:00:48.979> this

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
go proteus amount stuck to it I use this

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.520 
go proteus amount stuck to it I use this
for<00:00:49.820> many<00:00:50.150> of<00:00:50.360> my<00:00:50.479> GoPro<00:00:50.960> things<00:00:51.199> that<00:00:51.470> I've

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
for many of my GoPro things that I've

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.079 
for many of my GoPro things that I've
built<00:00:51.800> including<00:00:52.159> a<00:00:54.070> skateboard<00:00:55.070> mount<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.610> a

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
built including a skateboard mount and a

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.689 
built including a skateboard mount and a
go<00:00:56.330> pole<00:00:56.659> I<00:00:56.900> think<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.890> easiest<00:00:58.309> way

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
go pole I think this is the easiest way

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.700 
go pole I think this is the easiest way
to<00:00:59.120> get<00:00:59.269> your<00:00:59.479> GoPro<00:00:59.900> camera<00:01:00.290> connected

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
to get your GoPro camera connected

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.250 
to get your GoPro camera connected
doesn't<00:01:01.040> require<00:01:01.250> any<00:01:01.580> drilling<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.930> yeah<00:01:03.199> you

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
doesn't require any drilling so yeah you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.899 
doesn't require any drilling so yeah you
can<00:01:03.620> go<00:01:03.739> with<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.400> it's<00:01:04.879> pretty<00:01:05.330> secure

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
can go with that and it's pretty secure

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.170 
can go with that and it's pretty secure
so<00:01:07.909> that's<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.510> first<00:01:08.659> part<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.770> will<00:01:09.890> need

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
so that's the first part you will need

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.410 
so that's the first part you will need
four<00:01:11.180> sections<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.170> three<00:01:12.650> inch<00:01:12.920> PVC<00:01:13.430> pipe<00:01:14.150> I

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
four sections of three inch PVC pipe I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.000 
four sections of three inch PVC pipe I
don't<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:14.869> if<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:15.020> mentioned<00:01:15.080> before<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:15.890> all

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
don't know if I mentioned before but all

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.350 
don't know if I mentioned before but all
the<00:01:16.190> pipes<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:16.790> will<00:01:16.880> use<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.240> this

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
the pipes that you will use in this

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.170 
the pipes that you will use in this
video<00:01:17.630> are<00:01:17.840> all<00:01:18.260> half<00:01:18.560> inch<00:01:18.890> including<00:01:19.729> this

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
video are all half inch including this

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.039 
video are all half inch including this
first<00:01:20.450> part<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:22.520> for<00:01:23.060> those<00:01:23.359> each<00:01:23.689> three

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
first part so for those each three

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.859 
first part so for those each three
inches<00:01:24.289> long<00:01:24.469> next<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.490> will<00:01:25.520> need<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:26.030> slip

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
inches long next you will need to slip

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.760 
inches long next you will need to slip
right<00:01:27.229> angle<00:01:27.680> connectors<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:29.180> slip<00:01:29.869> end<00:01:30.109> caps

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
right angle connectors to slip end caps

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.060 
right angle connectors to slip end caps
a<00:01:31.039> long<00:01:31.759> section<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.630> pipe<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.439> size<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.950> this

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
a long section of pipe the size of this

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.639 
a long section of pipe the size of this
really<00:01:34.399> depends<00:01:34.820> on<00:01:35.119> your<00:01:35.179> preference<00:01:35.899> this

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
one is 20 and a half inches and these

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.959 
one is 20 and a half inches and these
two<00:01:41.000> parts<00:01:41.390> what<00:01:42.020> we<00:01:42.140> have<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.409> is<00:01:42.859> 80<00:01:43.640> piece

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
two parts what we have here is 80 piece

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.419 
two parts what we have here is 80 piece
with<00:01:44.749> only<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.259> middle<00:01:45.530> section<00:01:45.950> threaded

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
with only the middle section threaded

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.760 
with only the middle section threaded
and<00:01:46.579> these<00:01:47.270> two<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.020> other<00:01:48.259> two<00:01:48.560> sides

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
and these two and the other two sides

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.310 
and these two and the other two sides
are<00:01:49.039> slip<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.789> then<00:01:50.479> we<00:01:50.539> have<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.659> right<00:01:50.869> angle

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
are slip and then we have a right angle

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.349 
are slip and then we have a right angle
piece<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> male<00:01:52.280> threaded<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.999> a<00:01:53.090> female

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
piece with a male threaded and a female

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.580 
piece with a male threaded and a female
slip<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:55.039> they're<00:01:55.189> going<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.520> come<00:01:55.700> together

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
slip and they're going to come together

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.660 
slip and they're going to come together
just<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:58.899> now<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.469> can<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:01.159> these<00:02:01.369> with

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
just like that now you can do these with

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.239 
just like that now you can do these with
slit<00:02:01.969> pieces<00:02:02.359> you<00:02:02.600> can<00:02:02.630> get<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> slip<00:02:03.530> d<00:02:03.920> piece

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
slit pieces you can get a slip d piece

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.989 
slit pieces you can get a slip d piece
and<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:05.569> slip<00:02:06.049> right<00:02:06.950> angle<00:02:07.340> piece<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.789> put<00:02:07.819> a

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
and a slip right angle piece and put a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.820 
and a slip right angle piece and put a
piece<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.210> pipe<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.450> between<00:02:08.869> them<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.170> didn't
