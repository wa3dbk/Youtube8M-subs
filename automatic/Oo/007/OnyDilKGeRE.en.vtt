00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.919 

some<00:00:01.250> geophysicist<00:00:02.250> tell<00:00:02.700> us<00:00:02.970> that<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.780> earth

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
some geophysicist tell us that the earth

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.360 
some geophysicist tell us that the earth
is<00:00:05.150> 4.7<00:00:06.150> billion<00:00:06.529> years<00:00:08.960> but<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.590> universe<00:00:11.099> is

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
is 4.7 billion years but the universe is

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.509 
is 4.7 billion years but the universe is
something<00:00:12.360> like<00:00:12.509> 13<00:00:13.139> point<00:00:13.530> five<00:00:13.950> billion

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
something like 13 point five billion

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.179 
something like 13 point five billion
years<00:00:14.759> because<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.080> seen<00:00:18.949> groups<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
years because they have seen groups of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.380 
years because they have seen groups of
galaxies<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> Hubble<00:00:21.840> Space<00:00:22.140> Telescope

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
galaxies to the Hubble Space Telescope

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.950 
galaxies to the Hubble Space Telescope
13.5<00:00:24.390> billion<00:00:25.109> light-years<00:00:25.380> away<00:00:25.920> meaning

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
13.5 billion light-years away meaning

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
13.5 billion light-years away meaning
they<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:27.990> existed<00:00:28.949> taking<00:00:29.400> point<00:00:29.730> five

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
they have existed taking point five

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.780 
they have existed taking point five
billion<00:00:30.359> years<00:00:30.810> ago<00:00:31.340> while<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> was

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
billion years ago while there it was

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.250 
billion years ago while there it was
believed<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:35.480> 4.7<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.600> five<00:00:36.930> billion

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
believed to be some 4.7 or five billion

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.610 
believed to be some 4.7 or five billion
years<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> earth<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.969> much<00:00:39.300> younger<00:00:39.620> than

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
years so the earth is much younger than

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.750 
years so the earth is much younger than
the<00:00:41.219> rest<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> universe<00:00:43.040> thus<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.370> Bible
