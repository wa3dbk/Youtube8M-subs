00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.970
 now we are catching up with some gazelle 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.270
 try this 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.270
 actively 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 120 no warning 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.450
 I myself ahead another gazelle 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.290
 try to catch up with her slowly 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.290
 so slow down 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.500
 90 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.090
 80 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.090
 So 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.090
 80 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.540
 preempts 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.100
 Now we are picking what we have 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.500
 obstacles 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.260
 we will handle what I 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 but 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.070
 previous car 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.360
 I have already stopped 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.360
 no warning 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.909
 no warning about anything at all 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.880
 so now we are checking how it works 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.270
 obstacle warning mode 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.060
 ahead on the recorder karkam smart this 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.210
 item including top rumor with function 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.210
 marking tracking 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.000
 the peak is a gazelle before us 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.710
 , 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.540
 in the course of our course there is a fence 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.950
 the fence here it is this fence and 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.590
 show these squares here 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.999
 displays from time to time distracted 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.680
 on big cars if hit 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.939
 truck that little square distract and on 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.939
 truck drove 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.020
 jijik 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.349
 can hear 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.860
 now he shows us a lot 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.349
 obstacle ahead 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.950
 this we have a truck is not straight it and 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.950
 display 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.420
 spoons 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.450
 Now the silence of the car is far from anybody 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.850
 what does not warn smart is silent 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.230
 markup do not break the cup is not here with us 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.490
 car neighbors strip he told 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.120
 the car in front of us again about this 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.120
 tells 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.850
 little knives 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.320
 markup tracking function works 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.700
 incorrectly 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 I have already talked about this video separately 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.140
 can see and here is the function 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.730
 obstacle warnings ahead 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.760
 works more interesting but bring 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:00.740
 there is something in some cases waiting 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.980
 she warns bad I don't know what 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.930
 connected here is evening 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.400
 see what kind of lighting and he 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.110
 warns of every obstacle 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.450
 which we have in the way of the cones 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.300
 In general, each adjacent strip does not 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.550
 neighbors that is almost as soon as the road 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.310
 no one is silent 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.720
 then squared some draws nothing 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.970
 nothing peaks happens as soon as 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.310
 something appeared even if you to 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.650
 crossroads approaching there ahead 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.340
 us some kind of fencing trees he too 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.630
 he begins to peak he responds simply to 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.630
 some obstacle ahead 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.290
 fire function does not work correctly 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.560
 so the functions are probably useful but 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.560
 bring still have that 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.490
 on the one hand on the other hand here we are 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.830
 we are going the car goes with the same 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.710
 speed and speed 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.380
 changing as he continues to peak 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.889
 warn someone it might just 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.729
 very annoying if we were with him 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.800
 getting close then yes then he should 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:19.300
 warn then this function worked 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.300
 would be correct in this case it is not 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.319
 Here the silence she met no one was 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.250
 there was silence on approaching the car 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.879
 right in the right lane 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.879
 started editing
