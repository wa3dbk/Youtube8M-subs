entirety<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.540> process<00:03:28.020> then<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.350> think

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
entirety of the process then I think

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
that's what really challenges but that's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.310

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
it's just the level of involvement
