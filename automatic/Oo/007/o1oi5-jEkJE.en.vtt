you know I needed a few laps to work on
him<00:01:24.630> well<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> guess<00:01:25.470> I'd<00:01:25.590> need<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> few<00:01:26.009> more

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

left<00:01:26.280> over<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> run<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> fuel<00:01:27.060> too<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
left over to run out of fuel too well it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
left over to run out of fuel too well it
was<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:28.920> close<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.460> was<00:01:29.790> confused

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
was really close and I was confused

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.310 
was really close and I was confused
because<00:01:30.299> initially<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.750> thought<00:01:30.900> he<00:01:30.990> said<00:01:31.049> two

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
because initially I thought he said two

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.539 
because initially I thought he said two
laps<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> thought<00:01:32.040> he<00:01:32.159> said<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> half

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
laps and then I thought he said a half

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
laps and then I thought he said a half
so<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.600> wanting<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.470> was

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so I was just wanting to know if it was

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.429 
so I was just wanting to know if it was
half<00:01:34.770> purvis<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.900> how<00:01:36.900> much<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.140> needed<00:01:37.200> to

said the 24 is two seconds back

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.910

I<00:02:10.030> honestly<00:02:10.420> was<00:02:10.810> thinking<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.410> would<00:02:11.710> rather

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
I honestly was thinking I would rather

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.890 
I honestly was thinking I would rather
lead<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.910> run<00:02:13.000> out<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.150> gas<00:02:13.390> then

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
lead this and run out of gas then

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.480

finished second and still have enough
left<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> could<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.050> won

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
left and think that you could have won

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.810 
left and think that you could have won
again<00:02:17.350> because<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:17.800> hard<00:02:18.070> here<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.730> the

the<00:02:37.780> same<00:02:37.960> strategy<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.500> us<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.340> wanted<00:02:39.580> to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
the same strategy as us and I wanted to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.190 
the same strategy as us and I wanted to
go<00:02:39.730> when<00:02:39.880> he<00:02:40.000> went<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:40.660> decided<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.080> pull

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
go when he went and we decided to pull

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.900 
go when he went and we decided to pull
the<00:02:41.230> reins<00:02:41.440> back<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> little<00:02:41.890> bit<00:02:42.040> hoping<00:02:42.730> some

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the reins back a little bit hoping some

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.040 
the reins back a little bit hoping some
more<00:02:43.030> would<00:02:43.240> run<00:02:43.360> out<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.510> fuel<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.810> then<00:02:44.020> I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
more would run out of fuel and then I

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.620 
more would run out of fuel and then I
saw<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.320> 24<00:02:44.920> come<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.580> thought<00:02:46.240> were<00:02:46.510> in

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
saw the 24 come and I thought were in

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
saw the 24 come and I thought were in
trouble<00:02:46.750> now<00:02:46.960> because<00:02:47.140> he<00:02:47.230> doesn't<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.500> to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
trouble now because he doesn't have to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.500 
trouble now because he doesn't have to
save<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.950> all<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.060> kind<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.270> made<00:02:49.390> our
