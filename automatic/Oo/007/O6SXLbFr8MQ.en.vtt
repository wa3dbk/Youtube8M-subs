 three years after the predecessor meter last 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.820
 light finally lands on the shelves 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.470
 fps of forray games proposes the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.140
 same formula as that little gem 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.280
 rough which was metro 2033 trying to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.070
 improve those aspects that do not 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.180
 they had convinced meter last light and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.220
 takes up the story of the protagonist 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.470
 artium exactly where we had it 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.430
 left tram and atmosphere one more 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.680
 time are the most interesting points 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.540
 of the production that boasts a yield 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.790
 of the raw post apocalyptic fly e 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.010
 stone the last surviving humans yes 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.000
 cling to a glimpse of civilization 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.460
 colonizing the Moscow metro 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.440
 far from dangerous radiation that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.060
 still infest the surface 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.040
 artyom's mission and tracking down 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.090
 the last one left in life a 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.890
 journey that will take our 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.479
 protagonist questioning himself on 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.850
 nature of these beings that maybe not 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.350
 I'm the real enemy to fight foray

 amateur the setting lives like not 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.549
 never 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.990
 proposing food for thought on 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.150
 human nature than even in the future 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.130
 devastated by nuclear war succeeds in 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.380
 split up following pseudo ideologies 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.880
 communist is rather than neo-Nazi i 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.619
 weak are subjugated by most 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.390
 arrogant and a striking example is the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.430
 female figure that in the described world 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.930
 from the pen of dmitry glukhovsky for 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.970
 of historical liberties laboriously 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.980
 acquired by finding yourself wearing clothes 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.390
 succinct of prostitutes and objects for 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.190
 the entertainment of males who do not 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.930
 remember what the mood is 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.280
 Ukrainian developers working closely 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 contact with the writer of the series 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.640
 original was not his own 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.050
 pessimism and perhaps also why 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.030
 their interpretation of a hypothetical 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.850
 post apocalyptic world turns out to be so 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.560
 one is sadly fascinating 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.210
 large dote directly linked plots by 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.550
 setting of the last light meter the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.860
 really well studied game rhythm for 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.630
 about 8 10 hours of campaign time the title 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.610
 alternates more relaxed phases with a spreader 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 agitated expert conflict sequences 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.970
 against hordes of mutant moments 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.500
 distinctly horror and much more 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.060
 during visits and settlements 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.040
 underground you can explore 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.480
 free roads to waste time 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.519
 listening to the dialogues of passers-by 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.920
 enjoying hidden details of the world 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.090
 game with great ease meter 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 last light can change pace 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.690
 abandoning yourself in the fly style 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.430
 devastated by protected bombings 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.989
 solely from your gas mask 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.090
 while the skies are covered with toxic clouds 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.640
 they are frequented by enormous beings 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.500
 steering wheels 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.390
 or you will still find yourself exploring which 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.520
 tunnels with the road lit by 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 torch to recharge by hand to give you a 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 minimum security will be yours 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.040
 equipment consisting of three slots 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.930
 grenades weapons the essential mask 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.280
 anti-gas filters that run out in 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.350
 few minutes and little else 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.060
 guns do not offer novelties 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.980
 relevant but the developers are 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.720
 been able to give them a personality 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.580
 strong and taking full advantage of the nature of 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.620
 botched weapons put together with 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.270
 spare parts menus have been 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.680
 completely revised guaranteeing a 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.450
 inventory more accessible especially 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.070
 playing with the pad 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.840
 You can also buy upgrades and 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.760
 and modifications to personalize guns and 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 rifles though around the levels yes 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.239
 already find various configurations 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.100
 another component that has been revised 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.570
 and the stealth one with different sections that 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.350
 it will be possible to play while remaining 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.060
 shadow 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.920
 thanks to a luminous indicator placed 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.750
 on the artyom wrist watch is 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.519
 You can check the alert status 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.500
 enemies while knives and weapons 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.390
 silent allow stealth killing 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.040
 unfortunately intelligence is noted 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.480
 not particularly artificial enemy 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 evolved enough to stage 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.350
 stealth and fun ed sequences 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.330
 organize satisfying static but fin 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.190
 too rough customers of everything 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.690
 this is mandatory however fat of a 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.190
 gameplay that despite the linearity 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.390
 of the playful experience leaves the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.180
 player the pleasure of choosing 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.250
 the approach he most prefers 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.170
 like meter 2033 following forray 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.739
 games sports a technical department from 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.840
 scream 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.940
 especially in the pc version 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.620
 graphic engine of the predecessor was 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.299
 further enhanced by ensuring a 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.590
 excellent level of detail though 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.090
 where it excels in the system of 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.900
 lighting and in the management of 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.400
 physics 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.079
 Ukrainian artists have been a lot 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.970
 able not to use the powerful tools a 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.290
 arrangement to propose on screen 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.209
 fascinating environments and never 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.890
 unfortunately the same cannot be done 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.420
 say of the character models of the yes of 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.549
 details hands ahead in the near future 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.750
 active the sound compartment supports 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.070
 fully the visual one with traces 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.010
 hit the spot and effects full of 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.940
 last light meter personality is a title 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.130
 who knows how to take the best of the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.720
 predecessor to expand it by introducing 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.460
 some minor gameplay improvements 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.229
 the campaign proposed by forray games 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.640
 will glue the screen for the duration 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.150
 of adventure thanks to rhythm 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.650
 cleverly orchestrated 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.410
 despite not missing any fall of 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.820
 style if meter 2033 you liked it not 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.310
 you can let this great get away

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.020
 from the gameplay certainly not perfect but 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.020
