00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
tank the fuel pump will be a little

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.880 
tank the fuel pump will be a little
different<00:00:55.980> than<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:57.050> over<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> car

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
different than this over here on the car

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.720 
different than this over here on the car
you<00:00:59.039> follow<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.579> an

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you follow and you see that we have an

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
you follow and you see that we have an
accumulator<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> fuel<00:01:04.589> filter

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
accumulator this is not the fuel filter

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.179 
accumulator this is not the fuel filter
some<00:01:05.729> cars<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.270> fuel<00:01:06.600> filter<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.380> but

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
some cars have a fuel filter here but

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.310 
some cars have a fuel filter here but
this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.580> an<00:01:08.700> accumulator<00:01:09.530> what<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
this is an accumulator what you do is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.100 
this is an accumulator what you do is
you<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.100> straps<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.850> undo<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> straps

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
you go to the straps and undo the straps

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.670 
you go to the straps and undo the straps
and<00:01:16.500> drop<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:17.840> before<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.320> started

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and drop it down before you get started

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
if you have fuel in the tank you'll need

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
if you have fuel in the tank you'll need
