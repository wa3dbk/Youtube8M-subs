theoretically if this was true and
honestly<00:03:16.200> it'd<00:03:16.410> be<00:03:16.530> stupid<00:03:16.799> for<00:03:17.010> YouTube<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
honestly it'd be stupid for YouTube you

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.729 
honestly it'd be stupid for YouTube you
take<00:03:17.609> beauty<00:03:17.820> pie<00:03:17.940> down<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:19.320> honestly<00:03:19.620> it

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
take beauty pie down but honestly it

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
take beauty pie down but honestly it

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
would not surprise me if they did um I

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.479
