 station opened the president 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.890
 Today's open stations have become 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.779
 the continuation of the Moscow line they 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.699
 located along Dzerzhinsky Avenue and 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.540
 significantly relieve the southwest region 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.519
 capital Cities 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.769
 all names have historically each 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.899
 station its face in the design of pear 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.650
 muslin motifs in the concept of mikhalovo 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.659
 winter evening

 and over Petrovschina I lit the star 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.100
 sky design new stations alexander 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.930
 Lukashenko was pleased with the beautiful and without 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.300
 frills thanks to the new progressive 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.850
 solutions metrostroevtsam managed to cheapen 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.620
 construction while the subway remains 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.809
 the most expensive transport 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.090
 project kilometer is worth 50 million 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.280
 dollars the president demanded from 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.289
 metro builders keep up the pace of work 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.550
 develop especially our experts 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:10.929
 in demand today and abroad 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.880
 metrostroy must be kept first for 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.160
 of yourself 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.920
 but today it is not the main 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.190
 sectional river is not relevant for metro 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.530
 but still we want to save to 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.659
 build why my second 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.060
 lose them no pants never 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.210
 create it we spent ready 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.909
 not visions dollar to recreate this 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.060
 the school therefore it is necessary to save it therefore 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.369
 they are ready to Moscow is built no people 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.119
 therefore, we cannot be deepened in some case. 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.729
 this school and in any case people well 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.890
 take something that is one and a half thousand should 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.070
 we have to be picked under 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.439
 land and build with us no one needs 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.950
 I add why I asked for the purpose 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.380
 so that we can provide services for 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.789
 outside and there is no need to go as they drive 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.590
 these migrant workers we will go there with 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.869
 organization and what to remember when Luzhkov 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.000
 he did not ask the builders give 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.880
 so please give us the specialists 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.180
 it is very important that we work for you 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.980
 provide at one of the new stations 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.420
 Alexander Lukashenko became to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.920
 talk to the press on the background 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.720
 election campaign in the us and after 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.390
 recent elections in Belarus and Ukraine 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.519
 we are talking about the work of the observer would eat 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.440
 who needs such an organization with extremely 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.099
 blurred standards asked 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.030
 journalists such an organization would need 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.519
 was if she stuck to what 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.310
 was wildly declared at its creation 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.709
 the whole problem is the dogs 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.109
 were interested and zapyady America 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.150
 then when they confronted powerful 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.340
 Soviet Union 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.650
 today they donâ€™t need this organization 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.100
 us because it does not fulfill its 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.319
 functions 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.769
 she also doesn't need a hundred years 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.200
 cooperation if on the eve of the election in 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.600
 Belarus, they have arrived with ready 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.139
 a report which they then voiced 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.859
 it was exactly like that with Ukraine before 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:16.730
 these blanks were already prepared blanks 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.799
 what we call everything was ready them 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.989
 voiced she voiced though indeed 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.550
 You correctly said that there is full 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.850
 rampant democracy was already they were doing something 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.060
 I don't know what they didn't do to please 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.090
 image e and west all certain standards no 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.520
 these standards we are with Russia and others 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.080
 Kazakhstan state Ukraine in volume 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.080
 including we insist 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.420
 let's work out these standards to 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.270
 they were one so that you could open 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.030
 10 let's question in 10 standards and 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.130
 say here is the third first standard 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.550
 normally passed the choice of the second 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.860
 normally the third standard Well 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.080
 let's access the mass 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.300
 information was not available for access 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.870
 third minus and so on on these 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.900
 there are no standards as they wish, and that such 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.000
 treats they try to impose their own on us 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.650
 standards and not even their standards 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.650
 non-existent they are completely 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.650
 politicized
