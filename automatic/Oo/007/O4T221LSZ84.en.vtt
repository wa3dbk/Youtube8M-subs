00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 to our guest from thailand as 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 Showroom replaces second time here in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.410
 germany and makes a car with me 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.289
 which says jan tabus will be in every europe 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.990
 old tattooed around the man pictures on the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 Skin says gerd tattoos and must 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 absolutely can not pricked with ink 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.320
 also be stung with oil so says 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.989
 Tattoos are not the same as in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 europe that it is just a beautiful picture 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.020
 but there is a lot of much 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.180
 more behind it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.149
 I now have a colleague from Cologne 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.050
 and patrick brought in with sack 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.210
 very much more familiar one sack 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.670
 land ultimately on two dollars together 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.430
 bag heavy out of the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.289
 Thai and country actually stands 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.960
 for sacred biometric form for so 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.390
 Originally these were jahns 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 built on that were really circles 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.900
 squares where characters in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 where any symbols pure 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.080
 tattooed but they really were 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 geometric 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.150
 what we see here now is a lot 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 Nice thing actually because it is so 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 often does not notice here is already 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.590
 he comes at the beginning of his I call it 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 all workdays on it 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.930
 preparations meets these sacred 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.170
 namely to be able to sting tattoos 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 his workplace is clean for himself 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.940
 what he can do what it will do in a moment 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 to really thank you 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.460
 especially with his teachers him 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.619
 and have enabled him 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.659
 have to do what he can today 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.659
 making holy tattoos sting 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.189
 yes what if this for years 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.389
 spoken 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.989
 definitely not with the tattoo 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:22.120
 machine there are two possibilities 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.349
 once with the really classic 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.180
 traditional may for wood or tree 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:34.269
 and zack for tips act and the cam 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.480
 Zack is actually of the form of the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.590
 handling is the same as most things are 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:50.109
 just made of metal 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:53.439
 That's why I always ask 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.329
 then I can make such a form 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.650
 choose such a god 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.469
 red instead study it again 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.090
 tattooing that would be so very clear 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.430
 to answer with no 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.799
 well alex yes do that he does 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.569
 not because he is not qualified 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.180
 to stab these tattoos 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.609
 because what you see afterwards is 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.370
 actually the cover of the feature of one 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.889
 sackes important is what the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.069
 tattoo artist the master from pity or 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.620
 monk from this tattoo does what 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.220
 These prayers are the while and 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.099
 be spoken before tattooing and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:36.729
 the activation after the actual 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:43.889
 tattoo process madame figaro dokusoap 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:43.889
 sarah davidovic ramallah abbas o 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.980
 For years brother belongs I have it 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.690
 experienced and must say once and always 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.420
 again and again that is such a thing 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.940
 It feels hard to describe it 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.510
 if he has not experienced it himself he feels 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.020
 in a kind of trance state a lot 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.450
 magic much mystic if you do not 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.830
 it has experienced itself as a European 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.150
 a start perceived as it is in the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.150
 outdoor activity 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.170
 who can stand as a bag-jan 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.960
 to let 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.620
 everyone really everybody is independent 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.420
 of religion skin color or any other 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.290
 what do you think of me as a person 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.840
 make up 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.810
 Buddhism has for everyone 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.460
 the opportunity to say i have got there 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.500
 My question is should I ever times 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.980
 support and so is that too 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.200
 that's jahns that means when you 're ready 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.630
 be for such a tattoo because 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.980
 This tattoo must be respected 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.220
 be treated 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.220
 then come and that says jan stich 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.150
