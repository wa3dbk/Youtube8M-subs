00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone on it episode 5 of god 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.859
 and boar 100 goals and maybe is with 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810
 little we vote the hell because 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.740
 that may have been stopped around my nose and so 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.090
 she must has the next five minutes 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.920
 work more and hope it's soon 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.940
 has been corrected because everything is pretty good 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.380
 difficult to come and eat 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
 but I wish a little tired because 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 i come i just got back from paris i 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.570
 I have been awake for 30 hours 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.250
 where I just land a prize 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.779
 walked a little bit and occasionally 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 to drink or then to each again 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.600
 Number things visited and it was his 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.699
 super awesome that the back but she can 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.140
 what I almost call him a deer or deer or yes 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.760
 my parents who race on the meadow and with it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 comes as a really out of the blue 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 for example the fireplace comes in advance 9 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.160
 it was younger and luckier 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.510
 had just missed it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.980
 quite a big higher one 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.780
 but in the end, I fall for that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520
 safer good come home to the xy 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 slept for an hour and now I'm sitting 8 this one 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 Microphone behind him a table just 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.960
 to record 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.700
 the conceivable software of wages so we 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 go with this about the gameplay every first 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.129
 it would just be if i had only one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.480
 packed and it was finally the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.829
 shoes in victory for me one 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.570
 single by robin van persie 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.370
 I once had a two with and day by day 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.199
 and me almost nothing on this that karim 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 Stretching ankles after a day will be beautiful 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 jana actually not really a nice name 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.670
 best to bounce off 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.080
 the end can free and draw there 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.000
 stays with so better to just get in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.590
 a win so its best to lean 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 the appearance software results me 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.840
 be an episode with a lot 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.310
 matches 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.659
 it was under the scene where i find that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.439
 quite four people quite different 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.060
 quick guide cunts 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.799
 because if people don't have a script that means 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.880
 that I therefore only less cabbage 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.680
 clean with groups of dispersion can 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.970
 contest so I leave the acorns something 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.590
 from 5 games I played my 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 100 goals while I will actually be there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 and have finished variety 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 think again what i mean we go them now 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.040
 on our third was one and that was with 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.570
 sunny weather and usually sunny weather too 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.130
 play lime bay that sounds very stupid 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.900
 but i think i could filled up in the sun 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.400
 to play completely recovered on next ' 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 I started with sandals from one 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 a bit faster or I feel a bit faster 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.689
 when they get the hang of it too with nixon and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 throne of the mouse that are all the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 asked why I didn't get the gop and van 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.290
 embrace their goals on the neck 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.520
 chendo 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.380
 we can only record the destination 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.820
 try to come quickly to fix month 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.020
 we will come eight mate problem 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.549
 in just simply money 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.649
 have to buy it very quickly that it 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.659
 and I'm fine doctor knows kaki 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.950
 might be because an april is 2 kg but that is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.180
 just for nexus or preference and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.799
 well i mean so uh i can do that there 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.090
 so maybe I just record up 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.040
 waited April then I go there a lot 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 entertain bk files because what i do with 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.130
 2010 you left when I even had the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.869
 bare clones with a strong team 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.250
 important that maybe instead of 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.899
 that I immediately say that neck penny 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.129
 cable has arrived but nothing and voids are coming 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.660
 just do not worry about it 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.770
 to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 what the playstation 4 of course come 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.740
 inside and I will give you a live soon 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.000
 so asks app streams my agree 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.110
 see when I could go to the time 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.400
 find something to go with it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.150
 listen because I am very sick at the moment 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.350
 very busy 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.120
 it has to be a lot of reason with school 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.710
 but for the week i have vacation then 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.790
 the carnival and form as that core of 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.230
 know this then you are not really 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 but that clean Brabant party 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.720
 where you are four days apart continuously 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.280
 lamb is going to convuls 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.870
 dressing yourself up then that is 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.370
 actually i already pack when you order 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.870
 yesterday or yesterday you actually need me 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.640
 say I ordered my suit to be bald 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.350
 mafiosi or bird in the of the mafia 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.090
 I had seen a pair of packages 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.860
 for example, just such a dick suit 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.300
 your gambling nearly gorilla suits 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.570
 pick my arm up at you will the day 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.520
 afterwards 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.050
 maybe another time for this in 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.920
 Khartoum with a Mafiosi is stole 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.540
 it actually my choice 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.460
 here you can see already enough that I just missed 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.780
 the 133 fit with my regular 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.370
 but finally gets are then still 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.510
 single with the nice in two has started 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.490
 of persie that a lack of which you just 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.990
 dirt has been removed from the pan you can me 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.190
 So input shoot for silver play off 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.810
 and may it has become a small mistake 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.830
 I guess the fog is melting too 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.000
 super satisfied with it 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.950
 we are also called other fingers about it 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.750
 generally i think elia and the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.370
 pine best where will i need one to 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.200
 him east west band about dressing night 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.880
 and Elijah the trunk height actually already 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.350
 the pain then i will have a certain template 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.940
 I wars for the course they didn't 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.290
 of others left front when was the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.730
 blame if she ends up coming world 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.140
 is really super nice busy 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.970
 because of course almost nothing 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.800
 everything won nor tamminga look too 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.630
 quick and connectable about the team 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.040
 because i'm actually there almost everything 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.480
 it might even twice with 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.470
 lost and I have so many 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.820
 played matches so maybe 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.380
 often wake that up 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.060
 that's quite a cheap team on it 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.260
 a-players after and on sky-point cheap 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.430
 buy an alternative 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.140
 role it gets on a break we get 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 Locadia get that fine by me but 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 left by side I think it read in the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.700
 pan you can just elia harold is real 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.739
 not single tier level i think a lot 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.660
 cheaper but the pilot he codes and 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.950
 the pan of natural silver tendon 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.360
 level again I think he bit thank the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.950
 graduate from your personal taste 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.690
 why ruined a goal 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.770
 12 minute and it finally made it the pye and 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.450
 normally single 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.590
 there with a pass all inverness alec 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.450
 about the keeper who was actually 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.520
 impracticable the curve it was really 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.230
 c and i'll let your ankles trick anyway 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.570
 nice bunch on it by album name and that 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.459
 sprinkle for the ball echo soprano as if 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.900
 the good mattress header was very sitting 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.370
 there in the like the sun of my head 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.140
 eventually scarecrow in god's back 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.820
 with role of price that each have an exact it 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.560
 we also would cannonball was not 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.030
 his head and the bowl of bald heads that too 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.200
 stop the ball until he has her 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.430
 he actually saves to someone 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.080
 nowhere actually he again one 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.310
 gigantic knife why vanpers 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.780
 his only goal to open 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.660
 but finally he didn't 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.920
 for each other 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.150
 I'm going to do it a bit 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.860
 assistance and shoot more for the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.270
 goalkeeper to shoot the celebration 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.980
 so they come immediately or that the 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.210
 goals and about twenty matches or 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.830
 as the dark side of the end came on him 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.850
 see exactly and so far every 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.350
 match won more 5 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.270
 limited competitions can now again 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.640
 and our profit range though me 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.290
 become an additional optional objective 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.030
 we leave behind as much as possible 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.440
 we get the title us now 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.690
 quite recommend so if there are five extra 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.830
 kaki can invest in other players as well 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.300
 you have to give apps will do the consolation 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.800
 but disney van tijn from life coach 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.120
 of course you didn't like him 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.200
 too like at home in order to subscribers who 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.910
 subscribed are a bit painful 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.530
 but not now you do the uploaded by 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.880
 cult of social media links in the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.440
 description are 1 to once 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.440
 and she will keep saying babbles
