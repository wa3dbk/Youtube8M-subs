there's a lot of how-to videos for this
printer<00:02:24.540> online<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.160> to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
printer online but I'm just going to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.640 
printer online but I'm just going to
give<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> taste<00:02:26.850> for<00:02:27.630> how<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.050> works<00:02:28.260> okay

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
give you a taste for how it works okay

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.440 
give you a taste for how it works okay
so<00:02:28.830> there's<00:02:29.220> really<00:02:29.370> only<00:02:29.460> two<00:02:29.700> plugs<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.360> go

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
so there's really only two plugs that go

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.000 
so there's really only two plugs that go
into<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> printer<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> power<00:02:31.680> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
into the printer one is the power and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.380 
into the printer one is the power and
the<00:02:32.490> other<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> USB<00:02:33.720> which<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.500> optional<00:02:35.390> so

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the other is a USB which is optional so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.420 
the other is a USB which is optional so
if<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.990> print<00:02:37.290> something<00:02:37.500> you

if you want to print something you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.730 
if you want to print something you
basically<00:02:38.940> plug<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.540> printer<00:02:39.930> into<00:02:40.320> your

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
basically plug the printer into your

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.460 
basically plug the printer into your
computer<00:02:41.490> or<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.910> case<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.960> surface

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
computer or in this case on a surface

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.980 
computer or in this case on a surface
you<00:02:43.710> want<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.160> import<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.670> model<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.300> you've

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
you want to import a model that you've

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.740 
you want to import a model that you've
downloaded<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.100> let's<00:02:47.340> look<00:02:47.520> at<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> guitar<00:02:48.360> a

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
downloaded so let's look at the guitar a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
downloaded so let's look at the guitar a
wall<00:02:49.230> mount<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.800> downloaded<00:02:50.430> from<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
wall mount that I downloaded from the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.530 
wall mount that I downloaded from the
internet<00:02:51.830> okay<00:02:52.860> BAM<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.180> see<00:02:54.420> it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
internet okay BAM so you can see it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
internet okay BAM so you can see it
right<00:02:54.690> over<00:02:54.720> there<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.820> kind

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
right over there and then you can kind

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.360 
right over there and then you can kind
of<00:02:57.060> look<00:02:57.240> around<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.020> position<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.830> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of look around you can position it this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.870 
of look around you can position it this
cube<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.360> box<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:01.530> I'm<00:03:01.680> showing<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.640> is

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
cube this box that I'm showing this is

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.380 
cube this box that I'm showing this is
actually<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:04.140> cube<00:03:04.530> dot<00:03:05.340> square<00:03:05.820> that's<00:03:06.120> in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
actually the cube dot square that's in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.200 
actually the cube dot square that's in
there<00:03:06.630> okay<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.070> even<00:03:08.250> add<00:03:08.490> multiple

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
there okay so you can even add multiple

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.450 
there okay so you can even add multiple
things<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.870> wanted<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> could<00:03:10.950> add<00:03:10.980> in

you<00:03:35.310> have<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.520> do<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.570> scan<00:03:37.050> your<00:03:37.080> object

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
you have to do is just scan your object

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.430 
you have to do is just scan your object
so<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:37.980> kind<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.250> go<00:03:38.820> around<00:03:39.330> your<00:03:39.690> object<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
so you kind of go around your object and

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.550 
so you kind of go around your object and
you<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.190> scan<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:42.000> after<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.870> scan<00:03:43.290> it

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
you just scan it and after you scan it

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.240 
you just scan it and after you scan it
then<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.910> will<00:03:45.180> convert<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.440> 3d<00:03:47.010> object

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
then it will convert it to a 3d object

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.400 
then it will convert it to a 3d object
which<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.180> then<00:03:48.390> print<00:03:48.780> in<00:03:49.020> your<00:03:49.170> 3d

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
which you can then print in your 3d

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.449 
which you can then print in your 3d

issues here now a lot of this stuff I

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.670 
issues here now a lot of this stuff I
could<00:06:00.390> have<00:06:00.510> actually<00:06:00.870> prevented<00:06:01.350> this<00:06:01.500> was

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
realize you can actually print support

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.750 
realize you can actually print support
structures<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.210> you<00:06:06.270> can<00:06:06.510> take<00:06:06.660> away<00:06:06.810> later
