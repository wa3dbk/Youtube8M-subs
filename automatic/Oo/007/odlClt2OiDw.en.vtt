00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.340
 today we are going to teach you how to deactivate 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 or activate notifications from 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.780
 whatsapp very easy procedure very 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 simple there are two ways to do it one 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.949
 urged through the configuration or the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 cell phone settings menu and the other one is 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.600
 entering your menu or 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 configuration of the application and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.140
 better way I would think that is to do it to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.880
 through adjustments cell as 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.160
 a faster and more secure way 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.510
 do it to do it through the angel 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 is the configuration of the application 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 but first we invite you to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.040
 all the videos and leave the questions 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.500
 comments or suggestions then we go 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.809
 first by the settings option 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.149
 we enter adjustments we go here to the center 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.610
 of notifications and being in the center 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.540
 of notifications we go down completely 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.790
 and we look for the facebook application 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.830
 here is forgiveness we seek the application of 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.670
 whatsapp you are still here to the application 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.790
 by WhatsApp 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 here we have 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.040
 several options to activate and deactivate 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.750
 different notifications here we can 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.000
 turn off sound notifications 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.040
 but a message arrives we can deactivate 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.280
 see on the screen block the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.750
 notifications we can also see 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.970
 disable notifications in the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.780
