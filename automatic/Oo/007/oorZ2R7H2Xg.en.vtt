this<00:00:07.770> tutorial<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.400> designed<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> give<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
this tutorial is designed to give you a

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.000 
this tutorial is designed to give you a
basic<00:00:09.540> understanding<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.469> how<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.679> work<00:00:10.800> with

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
basic understanding of how to work with

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.270 
basic understanding of how to work with
keyframes<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.910> Premiere<00:00:12.300> Pro<00:00:12.330> 2.0<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:14.099> what

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
keyframes in Premiere Pro 2.0 so what

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.460 
keyframes in Premiere Pro 2.0 so what
exactly<00:00:14.400> are<00:00:14.849> keyframes<00:00:15.480> well

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
exactly are keyframes well

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.170 
exactly are keyframes well
keyframes<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:17.100> specific<00:00:17.580> points<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:17.970> time

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
keyframes are specific points in time

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.000 
keyframes are specific points in time
where<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> editor<00:00:19.289> determine<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
where we as the editor determine the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.340 
where we as the editor determine the
value<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.369> eclipse<00:00:20.910> effects<00:00:21.390> property<00:00:22.109> or

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
value of eclipse effects property or

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.560 
value of eclipse effects property or
properties<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.369> being<00:00:23.550> animated<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
properties that are being animated the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
properties that are being animated the
computer<00:00:25.019> then<00:00:25.230> calculates<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.010> renders<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
computer then calculates and renders the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
computer then calculates and renders the
in-between<00:00:27.060> frames<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.779> required<00:00:28.199> to
