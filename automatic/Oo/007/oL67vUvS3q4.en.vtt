00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
broken up into smaller sections which I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
broken up into smaller sections which I
prefer<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> find<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.200> easier<00:01:07.560> to

really<00:01:12.330> wonderful<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.619> more

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
really wonderful and it's a lot more

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.980 
really wonderful and it's a lot more
advanced<00:01:14.490> than<00:01:16.220> probably<00:01:17.659> just<00:01:19.970> certain

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
advanced than probably just certain

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.330 
advanced than probably just certain
products<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.110> where<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> stuff

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340

products and where to put them and stuff
like<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.450> definitely<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.470> lot

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like that so it definitely has a lot

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.520 
like that so it definitely has a lot
more<00:01:26.299> advanced<00:01:28.310> techniques

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.560 

so<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.370> kind<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.610> how<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.820> book<00:01:34.120> looks<00:01:34.390> it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
so this is kind of how the book looks it

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.820 
so this is kind of how the book looks it
kind<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.840> looks<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.140> little<00:01:35.260> bit<00:01:35.530> like<00:01:35.800> a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
kind of looks a little bit like a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.480 
kind of looks a little bit like a
textbook<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.850> lot<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.990> paragraphs<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.220> lot<00:01:39.370> of

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
textbook a lot of paragraphs a lot of

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.950 
textbook a lot of paragraphs a lot of
readings<00:01:39.910> so<00:01:40.180> if<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:40.420> don't<00:01:40.600> like<00:01:40.780> reading

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
readings so if you don't like reading

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.930 
readings so if you don't like reading
and<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.190> probably<00:01:42.430> not<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.760> book<00:01:42.910> for

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
and this is probably not the book for

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.810 
and this is probably not the book for
you<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:44.590> love<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:45.010> illustration<00:01:45.729> in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
you I really love this illustration in

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820 
you I really love this illustration in
the<00:01:45.850> book<00:01:46.060> because<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.900> gives<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.229> very<00:01:47.350> over

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
the book because it gives a very over

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.600 
the book because it gives a very over
dramatized<00:01:49.470> picture<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.650> how<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.400> should

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
dramatized picture of how you should

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.330 
dramatized picture of how you should
shade<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.540> contour<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.470> highlight<00:01:54.130> your

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
shade and contour and highlight your

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.450 
shade and contour and highlight your
face<00:01:54.550> so<00:01:55.150> it<00:01:55.360> gives<00:01:55.960> in<00:01:56.460> over-exaggerated

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
face so it gives in over-exaggerated

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.010 
face so it gives in over-exaggerated
that<00:01:57.729> way<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:57.940> can<00:01:58.119> see<00:01:58.300> exactly<00:01:58.330> where<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
that way you can see exactly where you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.719 
that way you can see exactly where you
want<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.260> put<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.530> now<00:01:59.710> obviously<00:02:00.220> when<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.580> do

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
want to put it now obviously when you do

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.490 
want to put it now obviously when you do
your<00:02:00.850> makeup<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.840> wouldn't<00:02:02.110> do<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.350> like

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500

now<00:03:16.440> one<00:03:16.620> thing<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.950> didn't<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.310> about<00:03:17.460> this

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
now one thing I didn't like about this

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.820 
now one thing I didn't like about this
book<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.540> uses<00:03:18.990> a<00:03:19.020> lot<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.470> technical

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
book is it uses a lot of technical

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.880 
book is it uses a lot of technical
drawings<00:03:20.210> rather<00:03:21.210> than<00:03:21.540> actual<00:03:22.110> pictures<00:03:22.710> so

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
drawings rather than actual pictures so

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.100 
drawings rather than actual pictures so
I<00:03:22.920> feel<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.490> they<00:03:23.640> use<00:03:23.850> real<00:03:24.090> pictures<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
I feel like if they use real pictures it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.380 
I feel like if they use real pictures it
would<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.680> easier<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:26.190> tell<00:03:26.430> kind<00:03:27.240> of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
would be a little easier to tell kind of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.190 
would be a little easier to tell kind of
what<00:03:27.740> exactly<00:03:29.540> where<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.750> should<00:03:30.780> apply<00:03:30.960> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
what exactly where you should apply the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.180 
what exactly where you should apply the
makeup<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.710> stuff<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.250> but<00:03:33.150> they<00:03:34.190> all

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
makeup and stuff like that but they all

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.130 
makeup and stuff like that but they all
include<00:03:35.580> little<00:03:36.180> sketches<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.810> drawings

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
include little sketches and drawings

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:47.510 
include little sketches and drawings
like<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.560> personally<00:03:46.950> feel<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.370> would

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
like this so I personally feel it would

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.430 
like this so I personally feel it would
have<00:03:47.610> been<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.850> little<00:03:48.060> more<00:03:48.450> beneficial<00:03:49.230> if

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
have been a little more beneficial if

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.270 
have been a little more beneficial if
they'd<00:03:49.620> use<00:03:49.890> real<00:03:51.170> pictures<00:03:52.170> for<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.560> but

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
they'd use real pictures for that but

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.320 
they'd use real pictures for that but
also<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.640> can<00:03:53.880> still<00:03:54.180> see<00:03:54.390> exactly<00:03:54.780> um<00:03:56.330> where

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
also you can still see exactly um where

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.840 
also you can still see exactly um where
you<00:03:57.510> need<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.810> put<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.080> colors<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.100> how

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
you need to put the colors and and how

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.610 
you need to put the colors and and how
to<00:03:59.910> apply<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.230> not<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.830> huge<00:04:03.620> sunny

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to apply it so it's not a huge sunny

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.100 
to apply it so it's not a huge sunny
huge<00:04:04.860> thing<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.610> feel<00:04:05.820> personally<00:04:06.480> for<00:04:06.960> me

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
huge thing but I feel personally for me

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.080 
huge thing but I feel personally for me
it<00:04:07.290> would<00:04:07.440> be<00:04:07.470> easier<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.220> see<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.490> on<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> real

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
it would be easier to see it on a real

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.230 
it would be easier to see it on a real
live<00:04:09.360> person<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.340> book<00:04:11.520> is<00:04:11.700> also<00:04:11.880> great
