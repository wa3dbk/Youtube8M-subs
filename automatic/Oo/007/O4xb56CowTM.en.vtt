00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
trigger with it but the thing is is that

this<00:02:53.820> shotgun<00:02:54.360> does<00:02:54.810> carry<00:02:55.140> some<00:02:55.470> kickback<00:02:55.860> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it which makes it a little bit tough to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.040 
it which makes it a little bit tough to
aim<00:02:58.830> down<00:02:59.070> sight<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.730> maintain<00:03:00.570> accuracy

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
but you got to take consideration of the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.020 
but you got to take consideration of the
bullet<00:03:05.850> spray<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.450> USA<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.320> 12<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.770> well

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
you know I don't even know how I would

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.780 
you know I don't even know how I would
do<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.440> statistically<00:03:32.130> due<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.640> fact

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
do that statistically due to the fact

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.870 
do that statistically due to the fact
that<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.150> has<00:03:33.269> shell<00:03:33.600> spray<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.519> that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that it has shell spray so that

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.900 
that it has shell spray so that
definitely<00:03:36.209> varies<00:03:36.780> widely<00:03:37.340> now<00:03:38.340> due<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
definitely varies widely now due to the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.789 
definitely varies widely now due to the
fact<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.390> USA<00:03:39.750> s12<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> fully

that is actually a big mistake you can

with the shotgun and you want to be as
reserved<00:03:55.530> with<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.950> as<00:03:56.100> possible<00:03:57.380> but<00:03:58.380> when

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
reserved with it as possible but when

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.140 
reserved with it as possible but when

the time calls for it and you do need to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.210 
the time calls for it and you do need to
unload<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.630> trigger<00:04:00.900> by<00:04:01.410> all<00:04:01.560> means<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
unload the trigger by all means do it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.310 
unload the trigger by all means do it
but<00:04:02.609> you<00:04:03.299> know<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.810> burn<00:04:04.019> through<00:04:04.049> your

Amma really quickly with the shotgun so

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.780 
Amma really quickly with the shotgun so
be<00:04:06.389> careful<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:07.290> course<00:04:08.070> due<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.609> fact

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
be careful of course due to the fact

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.030 
be careful of course due to the fact
that<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.269> magazine<00:04:09.720> load<00:04:09.959> shotgun<00:04:10.470> it's

come up on you while you're sniping as

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.610 
come up on you while you're sniping as

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
far as hipfire accuracy goes and aiming

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.469 
far as hipfire accuracy goes and aiming
down<00:05:58.740> psychos<00:05:59.280> they<00:05:59.580> seem<00:05:59.819> to<00:05:59.849> be<00:05:59.969> relatively

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
down psychos they seem to be relatively

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.110 
down psychos they seem to be relatively
the<00:06:00.659> same<00:06:00.840> as<00:06:01.379> far<00:06:01.560> as<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.830> kickback<00:06:02.310> and<00:06:02.580> recoil

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
the same as far as a kickback and recoil

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.080 
the same as far as a kickback and recoil
so<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.500> can<00:06:04.650> get<00:06:04.800> away<00:06:04.889> with<00:06:05.340> firing<00:06:06.000> a

with<00:06:39.419> a<00:06:39.479> real<00:06:39.750> gun<00:06:39.930> but<00:06:40.469> the<00:06:40.650> fact<00:06:40.800> of<00:06:40.949> the

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
with a real gun but the fact of the

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.010 
with a real gun but the fact of the
matter<00:06:41.099> is<00:06:41.340> is<00:06:41.639> that<00:06:41.669> this<00:06:41.909> gun<00:06:42.150> is<00:06:42.479> definitely

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
matter is is that this gun is definitely

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.409 
matter is is that this gun is definitely
designed<00:06:43.289> really<00:06:43.710> well<00:06:43.939> to<00:06:44.939> be<00:06:45.029> able<00:06:45.270> to

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
designed really well to be able to

designed really well to be able to
maintain<00:06:45.719> on<00:06:46.139> the<00:06:46.229> battlefield<00:06:46.740> and<00:06:47.009> you<00:06:47.159> also

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
maintain on the battlefield and you also

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.920 
maintain on the battlefield and you also
need<00:06:47.580> to<00:06:47.610> keep<00:06:47.819> in<00:06:47.969> mind<00:06:48.180> that<00:06:48.270> it's<00:06:48.479> not<00:06:48.629> meant

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
need to keep in mind that it's not meant

need to keep in mind that it's not meant
for<00:06:49.199> medium<00:06:49.529> to<00:06:49.560> far<00:06:49.889> ranges<00:06:50.690> some<00:06:51.690> people<00:06:51.990> do

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
for medium to far ranges some people do

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.959 
for medium to far ranges some people do
also<00:06:52.289> feel<00:06:52.620> that<00:06:52.830> the<00:06:52.919> USA<00:06:53.279> s12<00:06:53.699> is

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:53.969 
also feel that the USA s12 is

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.640 
also feel that the USA s12 is
overpowered<00:06:54.629> I<00:06:54.810> don't<00:06:55.080> see<00:06:55.229> that<00:06:55.349> being<00:06:55.409> the

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
overpowered I don't see that being the

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.580 
overpowered I don't see that being the
case<00:06:56.120> it's<00:06:57.120> just<00:06:57.449> that<00:06:57.629> this<00:06:57.840> shotgun<00:06:58.229> is

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
case it's just that this shotgun is

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.080 
case it's just that this shotgun is
definitely<00:06:58.949> a<00:06:59.009> shotgun<00:06:59.400> that's<00:06:59.610> designed<00:07:00.000> for

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
definitely a shotgun that's designed for

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.809 
definitely a shotgun that's designed for
close<00:07:00.389> quarters<00:07:00.690> maps<00:07:01.110> and<00:07:01.440> can<00:07:02.129> wreak<00:07:02.370> total

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 
close quarters maps and can wreak total

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.999 
close quarters maps and can wreak total
havoc<00:07:03.150> if<00:07:03.539> you<00:07:03.659> come<00:07:03.870> face-to-face<00:07:04.289> with<00:07:04.620> it

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.009 
havoc if you come face-to-face with it

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.969 
havoc if you come face-to-face with it
which<00:07:05.819> in<00:07:06.000> reality<00:07:06.150> makes<00:07:06.690> the<00:07:06.930> USA<00:07:07.319> s12<00:07:07.770> a

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
which in reality makes the USA s12 a

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.079 
which in reality makes the USA s12 a
very<00:07:08.520> respectable<00:07:09.180> and<00:07:09.479> devastating<00:07:10.379> shotgun

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.089 
very respectable and devastating shotgun

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.249 
very respectable and devastating shotgun
also<00:07:12.089> keep<00:07:12.330> in<00:07:12.479> mind<00:07:12.539> that<00:07:12.779> the<00:07:12.960> amount<00:07:13.169> of

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
also keep in mind that the amount of

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.140 
also keep in mind that the amount of
damage<00:07:13.620> that<00:07:13.650> the<00:07:13.860> shotgun<00:07:14.310> does<00:07:14.669> is<00:07:14.969> not

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
damage that the shotgun does is not

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.879 
damage that the shotgun does is not
anywhere<00:07:15.539> in<00:07:15.750> comparison<00:07:16.289> to<00:07:16.469> the<00:07:16.500> regular

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:16.889 
anywhere in comparison to the regular

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.670 
anywhere in comparison to the regular
pump<00:07:17.129> shotguns<00:07:17.639> like<00:07:17.879> 870<00:07:18.569> or<00:07:18.839> this<00:07:19.139> past<00:07:19.379> 12

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
pump shotguns like 870 or this past 12

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.129 
pump shotguns like 870 or this past 12
so<00:07:20.580> you'll<00:07:21.089> be<00:07:21.240> lacking<00:07:21.629> in<00:07:21.719> the<00:07:21.750> damage

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
so you'll be lacking in the damage

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.320 
so you'll be lacking in the damage
department<00:07:22.680> but<00:07:22.860> it<00:07:23.099> makes<00:07:23.339> up<00:07:23.550> with<00:07:23.789> it<00:07:24.089> being

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
department but it makes up with it being

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.779 
department but it makes up with it being
a<00:07:24.449> fully<00:07:24.659> automatic<00:07:25.080> shotgun<00:07:25.650> and<00:07:25.889> a<00:07:26.639> high
