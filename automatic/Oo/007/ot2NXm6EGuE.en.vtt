technologies as the sculptures and other
artists<00:01:26.530> more<00:01:27.100> fascinating<00:01:27.970> perhaps<00:01:28.270> for

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
artists more fascinating perhaps for

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.380 
artists more fascinating perhaps for
light<00:01:28.960> as<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.140> medium<00:01:29.530> are<00:01:30.520> using<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:31.120> looking

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
light as a medium are using and looking

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.050 
light as a medium are using and looking
at<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.630> ephemeral<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.650> phenomenal<00:01:33.640> aspects

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
at the ephemeral and phenomenal aspects

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.730 
at the ephemeral and phenomenal aspects
of<00:01:34.210> light<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.630> think<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.260> interesting<00:01:35.530> thing

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
of light I think the interesting thing

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.310 
of light I think the interesting thing
about<00:01:35.920> light<00:01:36.760> as<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:36.970> medium<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:38.170> there

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
about light as a medium is that there

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.710 
about light as a medium is that there
isn't<00:01:38.440> any<00:01:38.620> ISM<00:01:39.130> there's<00:01:39.550> no<00:01:39.820> there<00:01:40.300> isn't<00:01:40.540> any

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
isn't any ISM there's no there isn't any

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.400 
isn't any ISM there's no there isn't any
genre<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.790> light<00:01:42.790> art<00:01:43.150> per<00:01:43.630> se

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
genre of light art per se

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.040 
genre of light art per se
speaking<00:01:45.250> art<00:01:45.400> historically<00:01:46.050> what's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
speaking art historically what's

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.690 
speaking art historically what's
interesting<00:01:47.350> about<00:01:47.680> each<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> artists<00:01:48.640> in

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
interesting about each of the artists in

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.610 
interesting about each of the artists in
the<00:01:48.790> exhibition<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:49.900> they<00:01:50.320> bring

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
the exhibition is that they bring

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.040 
the exhibition is that they bring
something<00:01:51.220> slightly<00:01:51.490> different<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.480> light<00:01:52.780> or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
something slightly different to light or

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.950 
something slightly different to light or
use<00:01:53.230> light<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:54.010> explore<00:01:54.400> different<00:01:54.640> themes<00:01:55.090> so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
use light to explore different themes so

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.350 
use light to explore different themes so
you<00:01:56.020> got<00:01:56.230> everything<00:01:56.350> from<00:01:57.030> politics<00:01:58.030> to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
you got everything from politics to

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.500 
you got everything from politics to
lighting<00:01:59.290> technology<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.520> scientific

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
lighting technology to scientific

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.800 
lighting technology to scientific
aspects<00:02:02.080> or<00:02:02.740> historically<00:02:03.730> inspired<00:02:04.240> sources

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
aspects or historically inspired sources

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:24.270 
aspects or historically inspired sources
of<00:02:04.930> life

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.580 

so<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> work<00:02:25.520> behind<00:02:25.700> me<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.270> cylinder<00:02:26.810> -<00:02:27.110> it's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
so the work behind me is cylinder - it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.670 
so the work behind me is cylinder - it's
my<00:02:27.920> American<00:02:28.640> artist<00:02:28.940> Leo<00:02:29.270> Villareal<00:02:29.720> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
my American artist Leo Villareal and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.170 
my American artist Leo Villareal and
it's<00:02:30.920> an<00:02:31.040> artwork<00:02:31.250> which<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.000> quite

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it's an artwork which is quite

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.670 
it's an artwork which is quite
state-of-the-art<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:33.290> uses<00:02:34.630> 19,600<00:02:35.630> LEDs<00:02:35.990> and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
state-of-the-art it uses 19,600 LEDs and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.780 
state-of-the-art it uses 19,600 LEDs and
it's<00:02:37.160> run<00:02:37.640> by<00:02:38.440> software<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.190> computer<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
it's run by software on a computer and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.710 
it's run by software on a computer and
the<00:02:41.570> unique<00:02:41.780> thing<00:02:42.080> about<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.560> work<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:43.130> that

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the unique thing about the work is that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.440 
the unique thing about the work is that
Leo<00:02:45.010> Villareal<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.220> an<00:02:46.670> artist<00:02:46.970> he's<00:02:47.180> both<00:02:47.360> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
Leo Villareal is an artist he's both a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.390 
Leo Villareal is an artist he's both a
visual<00:02:47.630> artist<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.440> he's<00:02:48.770> trained<00:02:49.130> in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
visual artist and he's trained in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.910 
visual artist and he's trained in
computer<00:02:50.330> programming<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.500> he<00:02:51.650> actually

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
computer programming so he actually

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.410 
computer programming so he actually
writes<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.430> software<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:54.140> runs<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.710> piece

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
writes the software that runs the piece

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.310 
writes the software that runs the piece
for<00:02:56.420> an<00:02:56.480> artist<00:02:56.750> that's<00:02:56.840> quite<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.170> unique

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
for an artist that's quite a unique

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.310 
for an artist that's quite a unique
thing<00:02:57.970> working<00:02:58.970> with<00:02:59.210> light<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.020> way<00:03:00.170> as

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
thing working with light in that way as

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.830 
thing working with light in that way as
a<00:03:00.350> medium<00:03:00.880> because<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.360> studio<00:03:02.660> when

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
a medium because in the studio when

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.290 
a medium because in the studio when
you're<00:03:02.960> making<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.440> piece<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.220> sort<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.520> make

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
you're making the piece you sort of make

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.920 
you're making the piece you sort of make
and<00:03:05.510> shape<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.380> work<00:03:06.560> via<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.610> program<00:03:08.300> which

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and shape the work via a program which

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.330 
and shape the work via a program which
is<00:03:09.050> then<00:03:09.170> translated<00:03:09.530> into<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.070> visual

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
is then translated into the visual

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.010 
is then translated into the visual
effect<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:10.910> then<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> run<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.840> make

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
effect so then you run it and you make

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.710 
effect so then you run it and you make
tweaks<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.650> go<00:03:12.740> back<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.190> change<00:03:13.430> it

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
tweaks and you go back and you change it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.940 
tweaks and you go back and you change it
so<00:03:14.720> that's<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.990> kind<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.260> slightly<00:03:15.470> different

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
so that's a kind of slightly different

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.440 
so that's a kind of slightly different
studio<00:03:16.610> process<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.410> leo<00:03:19.180> has<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.330> go

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
studio process that that leo has to go

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:38.869 
studio process that that leo has to go
through<00:03:20.630> when<00:03:20.840> he's<00:03:20.960> making<00:03:21.320> his<00:03:21.470> work

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.940 

so<00:03:39.879> behind<00:03:40.180> me<00:03:40.300> is<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.629> work<00:03:40.930> by<00:03:40.959> Chilean<00:03:41.680> artist

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
so behind me is a work by Chilean artist

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.930

perhaps<00:05:24.450> for<00:05:24.720> obvious<00:05:25.020> reasons<00:05:25.410> because<00:05:25.950> this

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
perhaps for obvious reasons because this

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.840 
perhaps for obvious reasons because this
looks<00:05:27.180> like<00:05:27.360> something<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.170> a<00:05:28.260> staircase<00:05:28.850> but

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
looks like something of a staircase but

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.900 
looks like something of a staircase but
it<00:05:29.940> was<00:05:30.030> made<00:05:30.210> originally<00:05:30.780> in<00:05:30.870> 1990<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.070> I

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
it was made originally in 1990 and I

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.910 
it was made originally in 1990 and I
worked<00:05:33.120> closely<00:05:33.420> with<00:05:33.750> her<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.260> recreate<00:05:34.650> it

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
worked closely with her to recreate it

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.130 
worked closely with her to recreate it
for<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.610> Hayward<00:05:35.850> Gallery<00:05:36.050> because<00:05:37.050> it

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
for the Hayward Gallery because it

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.110 
for the Hayward Gallery because it
doesn't<00:05:37.350> exist<00:05:37.770> anymore<00:05:37.980> as<00:05:38.370> an<00:05:38.490> object<00:05:38.610> and

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
doesn't exist anymore as an object and

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.780 
doesn't exist anymore as an object and
so<00:05:39.870> together<00:05:40.320> we<00:05:40.680> decided<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.340> set<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.670> in

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
so together we decided to set it in

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.640 
so together we decided to set it in
relation<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.570> architecture<00:05:43.230> of<00:05:43.380> the

relation to the architecture of the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.400 
relation to the architecture of the
building<00:05:43.980> so<00:05:44.490> as<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.700> can<00:05:44.790> see<00:05:44.850> behind<00:05:45.090> me<00:05:45.410> her

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410
