00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello to all dear friends of me 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.420
 name is Sergey and we continue to look 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.150
 mods for skyrim a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.220
 and today we will have enough 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.350
 unusual mod for armor if you can 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 of course so to speak because armor 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.050
 we as such will not be with us today 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 there will be a piercing yes some will say why 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.480
 piercing in general in skyrim well in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 principle with some I agree with 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 the other side is some part of it 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.469
 piercing let's say enough so fits 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.840
 under ENT the same rings and in antiquity not 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.350
 We put on all sorts of war probably well on 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.170
 at least so serials but it does not matter 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 well let's find out more in detail what is 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.140
 This is a mod I read the description of 5 options 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 piercing three steel material options 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 for there is no gold in the total score 30 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.609
 Subject options for left and right 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 separate ears for female and male 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.580
 floor sberra times they are supported by the body 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.340
 they and kadzhity so seals and lizards 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.670
 rest you piercing not delivered 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 actually something like this 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.509
 piercing enchants and that is possible 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.119
 also use them for enchantment 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.750
 you can enchant so much with all 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.180
 mods 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 with additional sets that seems to me 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.610
 there no one will kill for vanilla 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.630
 heads and ears from that is under all sorts of bodies 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.490
 also run all this side too 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 You can create a section in the forge 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 jewels skills are not required but 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 words actually tarusu 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 right ear uses 43 slot left 44 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.049
 slot that is if you have a mod 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.990
 which uses 43 44 slot unplug 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.479
 them because it will be probably but how 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 at least unusual when in your ear 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.240
 Two things are put on right away 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.390
