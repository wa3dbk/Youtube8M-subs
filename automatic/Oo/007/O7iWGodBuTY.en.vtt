00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.420 
little and this kind of took me back to
that<00:03:36.760> place<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:38.380> know<00:03:38.410> not<00:03:38.800> incredibly

one and I didn't see the contouring

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.720 
one and I didn't see the contouring

frustrated about because obviously that

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.270 
frustrated about because obviously that

think so at all you just kind of need to

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.270 
think so at all you just kind of need to
know<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.230> basic<00:04:14.590> set<00:04:14.769> up<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.040> that's<00:04:15.160> it

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
know the basic set up and that's it

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.400 
know the basic set up and that's it
Patrick<00:04:15.489> Wilson<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.269> one<00:04:16.810> who<00:04:16.989> has<00:04:17.140> this

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
Patrick Wilson is the one who has this

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.509 
Patrick Wilson is the one who has this
tie<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.579> odd<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.090> afterlife

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
tie to the odd to the afterlife

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.370 
tie to the odd to the afterlife
he's<00:04:21.519> passed<00:04:21.790> on<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.150> his<00:04:22.300> son<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.140> there

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
he's passed on to his son and so there

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.260 
he's passed on to his son and so there
you're<00:04:23.680> ready<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.070> go<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> film

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
you're ready to go and I think the film

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.270 
you're ready to go and I think the film
is<00:04:25.450> does<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> great<00:04:26.080> job<00:04:26.140> of<00:04:26.440> not<00:04:26.620> making<00:04:27.160> you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
is does a great job of not making you

have to have seen the first one to enjoy
this<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.290> think<00:04:29.440> they<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.680> great<00:04:29.950> job

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
this I think they do a great job

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.820 
this I think they do a great job

other thing I really like about this

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.150 
other thing I really like about this
film<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.720> was<00:04:55.900> caught<00:04:56.110> off-guard<00:04:56.289> by<00:04:56.470> was

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
film that I was caught off-guard by was

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.130 
film that I was caught off-guard by was
the<00:04:57.370> sophisticated<00:04:58.000> approach<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.539> took<00:04:58.720> to

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
the sophisticated approach it took to

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.850 
the sophisticated approach it took to
marry

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
marry

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.880

you<00:05:00.370> don't<00:05:00.520> see<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.850> lot<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.120> movies<00:05:01.860> but<00:05:02.860> I

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
you don't see that a lot in movies but I

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.410 
you don't see that a lot in movies but I
think<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.460> work<00:05:03.670> not<00:05:03.940> only<00:05:03.970> from<00:05:04.270> the

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
think that the work not only from the

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.350 
think that the work not only from the
script<00:05:04.750> by<00:05:04.930> one<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.650> one<00:05:06.280> L<00:05:06.460> but<00:05:07.000> also<00:05:07.150> the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
know they haven't known each other for a

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.680 
know they haven't known each other for a
good<00:05:18.070> part<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.340> their<00:05:18.430> lives<00:05:18.700> there's<00:05:19.450> like<00:05:19.660> a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
good part of their lives there's like a

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.240 
good part of their lives there's like a
strength<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.350> bond<00:05:20.590> there<00:05:20.920> that<00:05:21.130> they're

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
strength and a bond there that they're

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.980 
strength and a bond there that they're
not<00:05:21.370> willing<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.670> give<00:05:21.910> up<00:05:22.060> on<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.480> that<00:05:22.840> was

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
not willing to give up on and that was

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.480 
not willing to give up on and that was
really<00:05:23.290> nice<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.620> see<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.100> think<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
really nice to see and I think the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.680 
really nice to see and I think the
relationship<00:05:25.060> with<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.240> children<00:05:25.570> was

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
relationship with the children was

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.660 
relationship with the children was
somewhat<00:05:25.990> nice<00:05:26.170> to<00:05:26.470> see<00:05:26.650> as<00:05:26.740> well<00:05:26.920> but<00:05:27.490> that

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
somewhat nice to see as well but that

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.580 
somewhat nice to see as well but that
isn't<00:05:28.000> explored<00:05:28.360> as<00:05:28.450> much<00:05:28.630> as<00:05:28.810> you<00:05:28.930> know<00:05:29.050> this

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
isn't explored as much as you know this

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.190 
isn't explored as much as you know this
husband<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.160> wife<00:05:30.540> bond<00:05:31.540> not<00:05:31.930> willing<00:05:32.170> to

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
give up on each other and I thought that

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.210 
give up on each other and I thought that
was<00:05:33.850> really<00:05:34.120> nice<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.510> was<00:05:34.630> refreshing<00:05:35.500> so

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
of tricks when it comes to special

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.910 
of tricks when it comes to special

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
effects obviously from these movies so

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.320 
effects obviously from these movies so
I'm<00:05:48.010> interested<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.430> see<00:05:48.520> how<00:05:48.670> he<00:05:48.700> transitions

I'm interested to see how he transitions
there<00:05:49.540> but<00:05:50.020> he<00:05:50.410> gets<00:05:50.590> an<00:05:50.740> awful<00:05:51.010> lot<00:05:51.430> an<00:05:51.880> awful

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
there but he gets an awful lot an awful

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.590 
there but he gets an awful lot an awful
lot<00:05:52.420> out<00:05:52.450> of<00:05:52.660> a<00:05:52.810> simple<00:05:53.520> dolly<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.850> then<00:05:55.120> rack

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
lot out of a simple dolly and then rack

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.720 
lot out of a simple dolly and then rack
focus<00:05:56.020> or<00:05:56.200> pan<00:05:56.470> I<00:05:56.710> mean<00:05:57.070> he<00:05:57.190> really<00:05:57.310> knows<00:05:57.580> how

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
focus or pan I mean he really knows how

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.520 
focus or pan I mean he really knows how
to<00:05:57.790> make<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.360> effective<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.170> I<00:05:59.500> think

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
to make that effective and I think

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.140 
to make that effective and I think
that's<00:05:59.860> wonderful<00:06:00.220> for<00:06:00.610> anyone<00:06:00.880> who's<00:06:01.000> in

that's wonderful for anyone who's in
film<00:06:01.390> school<00:06:01.510> because<00:06:01.750> it<00:06:01.840> even<00:06:02.050> seems<00:06:02.290> like

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
dolly that's telling how low-tech this

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.120 
dolly that's telling how low-tech this
film<00:06:10.210> can<00:06:10.419> seem<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.169> gives<00:06:11.410> that<00:06:11.530> I<00:06:11.890> like

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
that cuz it gives the film a little bit

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.970 
that cuz it gives the film a little bit
of<00:06:13.360> a<00:06:13.419> timeless<00:06:13.840> quality<00:06:13.990> you<00:06:14.590> know<00:06:14.680> it<00:06:14.800> feels
