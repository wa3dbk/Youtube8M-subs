 Paul from San Antonio, Texas asked: 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.859
 Everyone said that you need to choose more when you buy fish. 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.300
 I love to eat fish! What's the big deal? 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 Dear friend, this is a big topic! Let us see if we will be stunned by the answer! 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900
 Hello, I hope to find a good fish. 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.540
 Great, I have what you want! 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The time for the bait game is coming! Please welcome the host: Dick Pirinco! 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Thank you, Al! Today's guest is Sheila. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.489
 She wants to buy a good fish in the mall! 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.590
 Sheila, we have three fish for your interview. What is your first question? 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.000
 Uh... well. Fish No. 1, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.300
 Are you caught or farmed in a good environment? 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.800
 Oh yes. I have nothing bad. This is a fish that has never been beaten! 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.000
 Oh, my "squid". 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Fish No. 2, have you checked the mercury content in your body? 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.069
 Baby, don't be so picky. My mercury content is not in the chart! 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.500
 You squid... 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.200
 Fish No. 3, I really want to buy tuna on the market. Are you a tuna? 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.489
 Ha, that is the most certain. I won't be squid and come to you! 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.179
 Wow. I am dizzy. 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.049
 Ok, let's pick the best fish! What is your choice? 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.000
 I made a decision! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 I am not going to buy anything, before consulting with a trusted salesperson. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Or learn from my pocket eco-friendly seafood guide! 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Hey, everyone sees Ah! Sheila made a wise choice for seafood. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.200
 Be sure to join us next time: Bait game! 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So this is the "real" answer, friends. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.500
 You don't have to have a "squid" head to make a purchase decision. 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.239
 I can't stand this punishment. 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:48.000
