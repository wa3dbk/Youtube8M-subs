00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:20.119
 The light from the window makes the cheeks faint 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.630
 Even if I was waiting for time , it was the largest 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:30.090
 The degree of the become soft enough to become if in the second half of've been also out because her likeness after light 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.360
 And Do was the best Best of Tteyuu 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.360
 of 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:43.020
 This time Sonoko Sakurai was asked to do the model is low beauty University students are studying the actual meeting 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.520
 An attractive woman who is not just cute 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:53.870
 It was the most important purpose to shoot in the atelier but it was a warning 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:59.329
 I took a photo shoot in the park called Botanical Garden 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:03.739
 That say demand for Tteyuu or asked to play a softening is good as it is without the reverse 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:07.460
 Also to some of I mean Tsu you'd like to see me through the straight camera and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.909
 Me and something like a time that Sakurai's and its place 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.909
 The one like the feeling of air also say Na if Komere transferred together 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:31.020
 As there was location, we do not have many lenses and can cope with any scene 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:35.040
 I was amazed that the dx 1680 mm lens was the best choice, but from a rather low 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.810
 Though it became main heel that we did photography 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.810
 Higher land prices because it is a western day 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:47.020
 The light goes into the range, but it was nanocrissed, and the colors were all 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.659
 I think I was successful at 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:57.549
 of 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:02:01.490
 I think that n represents both the time of the atelier and the resolution, so 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.070
 It says the kana was able to cover because it was higher 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.750
 Hmm 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:14.610
 Be the Tteyuu drawer of pattern choose to raise anymore saying longer in my 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.450
 When it comes to being able to do something, it becomes nothing more than something that seems purposely 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.560
 I really dislike it 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:26.890
 A person who receives a photo without a chance 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.650
 It is a work that is good for people to stop for a long time , even if decorating 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.060
 I think that Tteyuu aims it 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.060
 Is it what you keep in mind ?
