00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.590
 you who enter 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.590
 it has me deeply of the former form 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:13.790
 good morning I'm mirco minardi the director of the lexform blog 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.129
 . it 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.669
 Today we talk about the notion of a car accident 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.770
 as I was in 8 law number 102 inter 2006 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.320
 you spent the rite of work shoulders causes related to compensation balls of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.719
 damage due to death or consequent injury causes road accidents 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.319
 panda therefore used this sin tain manna road accidents 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.839
 does not find you in the previous legislation of reference 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.600
 what is meant by a road accident in particular 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.810
 in the live car accident report enter 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.070
 also the case concerning compensation for damage caused by road hazards 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.289
 as always 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.630
 in the uncertainty of the law 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.909
 two diametrically opposed readings were immediately proposed 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.440
 according to a part of the doctrine also the causes concerning the damages suffered to 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.420
 following a pitfall 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.020
 they must be proposed according to the betshop work ritual 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.189
 for a different one 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.400
 order of mountains 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.590
 the first reason is that the concept of a road accident does not refer to the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.980
 circulation 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.600
 as in venice in article 7 of the code of civil procedure 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.170
 which speaks precisely of the damage produced by the circulation of vehicles the determination 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.640
 the second reason why the legislator called for a road accident 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.930
 for towers include 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.520
 any hypothesis of a harmful case 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 that originates from the street 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.939
 or the third reason is that the phrase road accident 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.830
 bwaa careful expression katy perry legal 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.489
 it therefore designates any sudden occurrence 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.459
 unexpected occurrence in the roadway 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.379
 the fourth reason 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:35.120
 and that the nation for the law is to speed up the time of compensation 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.859
 in favor of 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.909
 I am a patty photo of personal injury or death 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:47.079
 regardless of the fact that the cause is a clash between vehicles okk an insidious 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.930
 however, according to this doctrine, the spirit of work does not apply 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.489
 damage to the bin 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.569
 due to a pitfall 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.780
 inasmuch as the race of law is reconnected to the social alarm of the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.259
 damage caused to vehicles 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:11.469
 therefore the causal presuppositions are a second this theory also the damage is 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.549
 derived from the use of the road 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.859
 event production workers have contributed to the use of a vehicle from 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.749
 any kind 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:22.810
 second 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.580
 another thesis indicates the phrase road accident 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.569
 yes overlaps 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.079
 perfectly 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.159
 to that of vehicle circulation 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.169
 otherwise it is said we would not have Sicilian terms of reference for the 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.379
 identification of disputes subject to fried eggs 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.939
 according to this thesis then in order to apply the work ritual is necessary 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.119
 consider the vehicle involved 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:58.029
 the dynamics and place where the road accident occurred 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.059
 die 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.249
 we see the vehicle 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:07.539
 vehicle according to this thesis means any type of machine 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.229
 guided by man 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:14.549
 that it is potentially suitable to access it freely on the road 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.919
 good on the road you are prepared for 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.889
 for which locomotion is secured. by means of a special movement organ 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.300
 or following traction anima or also followed 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.400
 of the direct action of man 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.800
 Article 47 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.810
 promote road traffic regulations 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.069
 classifies vehicles into vehicles with arms 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:46.379
 vehicles animal attraction speed 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.259
 sledges 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.939
 mopeds 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.530
 motorcycle 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.379
 vehicles 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.020
 filoveicoli 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.370
 proin dead 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.039
 agricultural machinery operating machines and vehicles with atypical characteristics 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.949
 fall 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.439
 therefore in the notion 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.869
 the vehicles referred to in Article 47 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.080
 including motor vehicles with rail driving 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.960
 while on mysql using 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.839
 the boats 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:26.120
 as already stated for article 2054 of the civil code 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.389
 of those for use by girls 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.689
 For example 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.520
 pedal cars 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.639
 what about tricycles scooters 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.569
 or disability 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:44.199
 and of those embraces of small dimensions for example arwad baskets for 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.150
 the expense the wheelbarrows faceboo because 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
 because the latter 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.449
 I'm not 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.979
 functionally 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.479
 allow yourself and build to circulate on the roadways so much that it is 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.750
 allowed to use 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.930
 freely without any limitation 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.409
 the part of the road of san marco carta e dintorni you say the manatee pavements 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.480
 obviously 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.700
 the situation changes if in a car accident 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.559
 occurs between a constraint 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:18.419
 rufy in article 47 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.719
 and an example of a scooter 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.589
 in this case the ritual of work will certainly be applied 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.650
 with regard to the dynamics according to this doctrine we can incorporate deplano 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.490
 all the development of doctrine and jurisprudence with respect to 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.779
 notion of circulation 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:43.159
 and so 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.939
 the norm on the ritual of work will apply in the event of a collision between 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.419
 vehicles in case 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.990
 which, on the other hand, there was no collision and in the event that the accident occurred 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.229
 verified while a vehicle was stopped or parked 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.060
 finally referring to the place where the accident occurred 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.389
 it is stated that there is a perfect one 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.110
 that overlapping 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.030
 between article 2054 of the civil code 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.720
 the jurisprudential elaboration occurred under the law number 990 of 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.750
 1969 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.500
 and the new rite under Law 102 2006 therefore 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.550
 87 also of a private area 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.169
 porquÃ¨ open to traffic 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.310
 add to an undetermined number of hey people 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.779
 even if access is not allowed 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:44.290
 in the presence of a particular 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.770
 berlusconi 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.500
 thanks for following me mirco minardi e.
