worked<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.539> most<00:00:21.750> part<00:00:22.220> you<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.250> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
worked for the most part you have to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.859 
worked for the most part you have to
have<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> gateway<00:00:23.789> down<00:00:24.060> before<00:00:24.359> building<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
have a gateway down before building it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.439 
have a gateway down before building it
before<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.800> use<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.039> ark<00:00:26.189> shield<00:00:26.490> but

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
before you can use the ark shield but

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.550 
before you can use the ark shield but
we're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> x<00:00:28.380> 2<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.449> but<00:00:30.449> yeah<00:00:31.320> after

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
we're going to x 2 now but yeah after

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
we're going to x 2 now but yeah after
down<00:00:31.740> my<00:00:31.890> simulator<00:00:32.340> put<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> pylon<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.180> mean

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
as you can see arc shield is it's pretty

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.880 
as you can see arc shield is it's pretty
weak<00:00:45.940> against<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:46.720> does<00:00:46.840> 5<00:00:47.110> damage<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.680> non

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890

more<00:01:51.760> kin<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.330> I<00:01:52.479> could<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.720> put<00:01:52.869> on<00:01:52.930> a

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
more kin and I could like put on a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.390 
more kin and I could like put on a
forward<00:01:53.350> or<00:01:53.440> something<00:01:53.799> but<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:54.100> point<00:01:54.340> I've

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
forward or something but this point I've

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.030 
forward or something but this point I've
got<00:01:54.520> I'm<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.210> contained<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.320> mean<00:01:56.860> he's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
down the for food I could've been

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.450 
down the for food I could've been
building<00:01:59.229> probes<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.740> could<00:01:59.950> expand<00:02:00.340> in

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
building probes and I could expand in

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.179 
building probes and I could expand in
myself<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:01.119> lot<00:02:01.869> better<00:02:02.020> ways<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.320> do<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.799> kind

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
thought was funny hitting it 45 damage

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.050 
thought was funny hitting it 45 damage
at<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> time<00:02:32.450> he's<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> one<00:02:33.840> probe<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:35.060> mean

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
at a time he's on the one probe I mean

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.490 
at a time he's on the one probe I mean
this<00:02:36.390> guy<00:02:36.570> well<00:02:36.720> obviously<00:02:36.900> wasn't<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> best

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

people are gonna be able to hold it off

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.010 
people are gonna be able to hold it off
pretty<00:02:42.630> easily<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:44.120> as<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.570> see<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:45.990> I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
pretty easily but as you can see here I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.390 
pretty easily but as you can see here I
mean<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.620> could<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.890> played<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.280> could

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
mean if I could have played this I could

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.130 
mean if I could have played this I could
play<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.850> much<00:02:48.030> better<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.540> said<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:48.990> just

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
play this so much better I said I just

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.510 
play this so much better I said I just
kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.320> blindly<00:02:49.710> winning<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.190> my<00:02:50.310> first

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
kind of blindly winning it is my first

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.700 
kind of blindly winning it is my first
time<00:02:50.640> trying<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> arc<00:02:51.120> shield<00:02:51.390> rush<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.900> I

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
time trying the arc shield rush and I

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.680 
time trying the arc shield rush and I
just<00:02:52.740> kind<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.100> threw<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.460> together<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:54.660> I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
just kind of threw this together like I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.300 
just kind of threw this together like I
said<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.470> real<00:02:55.650> game<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.070> could<00:02:56.190> actually

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
said in a real game you could actually

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.450 
said in a real game you could actually
expand<00:02:56.790> behind<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:58.980> there's<00:02:59.160> also<00:02:59.250> a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
expand behind it and then there's also a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.430 
expand behind it and then there's also a
lot<00:02:59.910> there's<00:03:00.180> probably<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.450> ways<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.780> defend<00:03:01.230> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
lot there's probably a ways to defend it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.120 
lot there's probably a ways to defend it
this<00:03:02.370> guy<00:03:02.520> was<00:03:02.790> obviously<00:03:03.180> not<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.540> great

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
this guy was obviously not that great

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.230 
this guy was obviously not that great
then<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.190> start<00:03:05.430> actually<00:03:05.550> building<00:03:05.730> probes

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
then I start actually building probes

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.910 
then I start actually building probes
and<00:03:06.420> mining<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.960> stuff<00:03:07.170> when<00:03:07.380> my<00:03:07.530> kill<00:03:07.770> his

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and mining and stuff when my kill his

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.680 
and mining and stuff when my kill his
base<00:03:08.130> he<00:03:08.370> does<00:03:08.610> start<00:03:08.940> using<00:03:09.120> art<00:03:09.420> shield

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
base he does start using art shield

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.870 
base he does start using art shield
against<00:03:09.900> my<00:03:10.110> zealots<00:03:10.470> who<00:03:11.010> are<00:03:11.130> light<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.640> the

against my zealots who are light so the
art<00:03:12.030> shield<00:03:12.270> does<00:03:12.480> hit<00:03:12.690> number<00:03:12.990> 20<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.160> his

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
art shield does hit number 20 but his

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.190 
art shield does hit number 20 but his
art<00:03:14.520> shows<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.910> gonna<00:03:15.180> kill<00:03:15.390> my<00:03:15.570> buildings<00:03:16.020> at

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
art shows not gonna kill my buildings at

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.070 
art shows not gonna kill my buildings at
all<00:03:16.970> I'm<00:03:17.970> started<00:03:18.240> pumping<00:03:18.360> out<00:03:18.510> zealots<00:03:18.900> but

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
all I'm started pumping out zealots but

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.150 
all I'm started pumping out zealots but
yeah<00:03:19.200> that's<00:03:19.290> really<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.770> point<00:03:19.890> i<00:03:20.010> got

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
yeah that's really the point i got

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.410 
yeah that's really the point i got

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
Benchley i eats dead at this point

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.850
