 anyone who asks you 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.520

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.860
 marriages you regret something not 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.640
 I had a choice I've never had other

 options within my reach 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.770
 I've been wondering some things 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.000

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.890

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.230
 all those things that I did were the ones that 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.230
 they brought me here
