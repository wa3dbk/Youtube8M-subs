not a lot we trying to talk these are

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.299 
not a lot we trying to talk these are
the<00:00:45.809> branches<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> tree

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the branches that are going on the tree

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
the branches that are going on the tree
so<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> tree<00:00:49.020> apart

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so now I'm going to take the tree apart

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
so now I'm going to take the tree apart
and<00:00:49.500> show<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> did<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:51.090> be

project drill holes in your driftwood

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
project drill holes in your driftwood
big<00:01:03.180> enough<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.600> thread<00:01:03.960> onto<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.320> piece<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
big enough to thread onto a piece of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
big enough to thread onto a piece of
rebar<00:01:07.280> normally<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.580> branch<00:01:09.240> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
rebar normally it's just branch on

rebar normally it's just branch on
branch<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.290> branch<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.010> stacked<00:01:11.310> up

branch on branch and it's stacked up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
branch on branch and it's stacked up
like<00:01:11.549> Lincoln<00:01:12.090> Logs<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.840> made<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.080> more

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
like Lincoln Logs but we made it more

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
like Lincoln Logs but we made it more
organic<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> spacers<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.570> here

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
organic these are the spacers right here

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
organic these are the spacers right here
you<00:01:16.560> cut<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> dirt<00:01:17.100> through<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> then

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you cut the dirt through it up and then

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.440 
you cut the dirt through it up and then
we<00:01:17.970> drilled<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> hole<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:20.000> select<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.150> really

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
we drilled a hole in it select a really

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
we drilled a hole in it select a really
hard<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.049> thick<00:01:22.320> piece<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> wood<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.159> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hard and thick piece of wood for your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.580 
hard and thick piece of wood for your
spacers<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> drill<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.110> middle

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.780 

channellock<00:01:28.590> vice<00:01:28.920> grips<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.460> hold<00:01:29.670> your

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
channellock vice grips will hold your

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.179 
channellock vice grips will hold your
spacers<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.600> while<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> drill<00:01:31.470> some<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
spacers down while you drill some of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.370 
spacers down while you drill some of
them<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.670> crack<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> cut<00:01:34.140> more

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
them will crack so be sure to cut more

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
them will crack so be sure to cut more
than<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.740> need

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.360 

we<00:01:40.030> took<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.240> nail<00:01:40.510> gun<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.140> we<00:01:41.320> added<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.980> whole

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
we took a nail gun and we added a whole

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.250 
we took a nail gun and we added a whole
bunch<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.760> branches<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.570> branches<00:01:44.230> that

bunch of branches to the branches that

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.140 
bunch of branches to the branches that
we<00:01:44.530> put<00:01:44.740> on<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.010> branches<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.850> I'm<00:01:45.970> going<00:01:46.120> to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
we put on the branches and I'm going to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.660 
we put on the branches and I'm going to
make<00:01:46.300> sure<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.960> puppy<00:01:47.320> doesn't<00:01:48.010> eat<00:01:48.460> the
