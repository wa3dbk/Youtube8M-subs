00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 that there is football you are from u2 speaks to them 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.310
 centrodelantero today I'm going to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.040
 teach how to replace stadiums 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.929
 using the pce deep selector good what 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.969
 what I'm going to do first is 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.059
 show them the stadium that I'm going to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 replace in this case is going to be this the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.400
 old trafford the manchester then they 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.130
 I will show how you can see is the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.430
 stadium where you who come by 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.340
 defect in the game 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.350
 and this is the one that we are going to replace 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.890
 so this was so that 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.870
 keep in mind that the new stadium 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.350
 that something will appear and the one who dresses 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.079
 aris this municipal is in a cloud 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.440
 it would be this I started not to know the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.449
 installed to do the example in the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.829
 description of the video will be this 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.589
 folder that is called psd crista god that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.989
 they have to put it in the kit server 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.810
 folder will only come with these 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.020
 three files 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.890
 everything is so that it does not put us a problem 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.580
 the selector 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.090
 when selecting our stadium and this 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.860
 img folder I explain to you is that appears 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.850
 automatically after Christ 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.439
 digital in its first stage 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.720
 as an event and this law to 1 and what 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.840
 let's do is the following once 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.810
 have downloaded the stadium they want 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.690
 put with these files so they have to 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.150
 have these actions well 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:40.410
 and we see this folder 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.110
 weigh this folder of the present strange and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.860
 the stadiums street and stadiums we 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.650
 can find on the internet is there 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.980
 several then what I'm going to do is 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.320
 Rename the folder I'll give 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.320
 in copy and the file ready 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 paste 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.010
 the file and save and ready 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.870
 air would be registered our 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.950
 I also tell you what we're going to do is go 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.950
 to our constituents 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.340
 and we are going to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:23.430
 give him here in old trafford that I'm going to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.500
 replace we have a click on the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.900
 picture this box what it tells us 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 is that the process has been done successfully 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.840
 now today again before 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.840
 so they realize 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.870
 this goddess that started has been well 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 I tell you friends and subscribe to me 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.150
 channel on my facebook page that 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.340
 they need things better than they ask me 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.500
 By facebook 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.460
 because youtube or sometimes number of the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.100
 comments 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.620
 well show me the notification and then 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.080
 you are left without some answer 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.860
 so then do not think that I 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.860
 he does not answer me 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.340
 everyone is fine 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.750
 in the profile of the list the link 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.880
 direct then well let's 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.750
 realize that in the game to our 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.080
 to know 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.890
 Y 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.680
 this would be the previous one that we 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.069
 appears then right now I'm going to 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.010
 teach how 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.010
 edit the match preview 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.660
 then as you see we have our 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.830
 stadium that is placed in the 'eurocup' 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.500
 500 a little 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.900
 the softwares if they do not appear the same 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.110
 that they had 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.830
 the manchester united then then 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.200
 friends that would be and 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.250
 that would be it, so now I'm going to 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.590
 teach 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.870
 to change the award-winning story 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.480
 then program necessary to do 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.850
 this is the weight in first data explorer 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:09.050
 who will be in the later also 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.880
 and the folder that has conditions generates 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.150
 the folder and the axis generates these two 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.710
 folders the 0-6 folder is in the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.770
 extreme of our style 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.860
 I think we're going to drag the asking me 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.570
 changed the previous one that I had made 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:28.030
 and what our stadium has would be 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.030
 this would be 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.330
 you are 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.110
 go to the folder 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:43.320
 in this view love is the folder but 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:47.360
 I did not believe in analyzing the trailers 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.729
 place and let's say save 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.060
 now we the game I'm going to support the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.060
 video 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.099
 then in a few minutes we'll see you 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.169
 and go back to migrations again here 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:08.680
 I was looking and he put me 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.360
 the previous one in the first stage and therefore its 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.669
 scholarship would take from rent but then the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.790
 I really did not find a solution to it 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.820
 of the previous 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.340
 this would be the one that appears to us now but 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.320
 it does not matter, I think it's the 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.410
 stadium however in this area 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.250
 so looking for a solution to follow 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.460
 trying and then when he has it and we 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.009
 He communicated good friends and partners 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.550
 tutorials but then excuse me 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:45.570
 the sad death is the truth not always 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.300
 it appears like this but the stadium if the 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.240
 stadium if the descent appears what 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.639
 it matters but what 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.340
 and they liked the tutorial any 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.449
 otherwise, do not hesitate to comment and 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.449
 until next time
