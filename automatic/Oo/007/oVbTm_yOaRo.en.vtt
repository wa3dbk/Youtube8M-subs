the<00:01:57.600> might<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.290> Legion<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> fill<00:01:59.159> your

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the might of the Legion is fill your

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.590 
the might of the Legion is fill your
foes<00:01:59.579> fear<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.420> round<00:02:01.100> or<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.939> maybe<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
foes fear it's one round or not maybe it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.960 
foes fear it's one round or not maybe it
could<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.990> two<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.299> according<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.020> your

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
could be two and it's according to your

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.300 
could be two and it's according to your
enemies<00:02:08.970> ice<00:02:09.390> resistance<00:02:10.110> divided<00:02:10.739> by<00:02:10.890> four

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
enemies ice resistance divided by four

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.130 
enemies ice resistance divided by four
so<00:02:11.790> 25%

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
so 25%

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.180 
so 25%
obviously<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:15.540> you're<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.530> against<00:02:16.860> 200

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
obviously if you're going up against 200

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.290 
obviously if you're going up against 200
and<00:02:17.760> your<00:02:18.360> blade<00:02:18.600> goes<00:02:18.840> grows<00:02:19.500> stronger<00:02:20.300> when

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
they are affected by it the fear of the

shop will go up on Sunday so I apologize
for<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.080> I'm<00:03:04.320> trying<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.620> get<00:03:04.800> videos<00:03:05.100> out

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
for that I'm trying to get videos out

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.780 
for that I'm trying to get videos out
and<00:03:05.519> as<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.880> can<00:03:06.000> see<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.360> damage<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:07.790> don't

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
and as you can see the damage I don't

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.699 
and as you can see the damage I don't
know<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.150> didn't<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.530> feared<00:03:10.890> Legion<00:03:12.709> so

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
know you didn't get the feared Legion so

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.130 
know you didn't get the feared Legion so
I<00:03:14.130> guess<00:03:14.610> combat<00:03:15.180> trainer<00:03:15.480> doesn't<00:03:15.870> really

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
I guess combat trainer doesn't really

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.430 
I guess combat trainer doesn't really
count<00:03:16.500> because<00:03:17.120> he's<00:03:18.120> too<00:03:18.420> low<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.840> level<00:03:18.870> so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
count because he's too low of a level so

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.390 
count because he's too low of a level so
I<00:03:19.470> don't<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.799> how<00:03:20.130> what<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> chances<00:03:21.989> are<00:03:22.110> of

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
I don't know how what the chances are of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.370 
I don't know how what the chances are of
actually<00:03:23.400> making<00:03:23.579> higher<00:03:24.540> level<00:03:25.019> enemy

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
actually making higher level enemy

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.949 
actually making higher level enemy
