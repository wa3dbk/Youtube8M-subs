00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
history today we're going to be testing

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.959 
history today we're going to be testing
it<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.469> see<00:00:10.650> how<00:00:10.889> far<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.370> could<00:00:11.490> jump

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
it out and see how far we could jump

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.850 
it out and see how far we could jump
we<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.509> layout<00:00:12.780> going<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.380> five<00:00:13.590> jumps

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
we have layout going in with five jumps

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
we have layout going in with five jumps
Phil's<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.370> his<00:00:14.490> team<00:00:14.730> full<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.000> golems<00:00:15.360> I

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Phil's and his team full of golems I

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.640 
Phil's and his team full of golems I
think<00:00:15.719> he's<00:00:15.809> got<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.139> more<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> clan

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
think he's got one more in the clan

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140 
think he's got one more in the clan
castle<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> might<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.520> fine

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
castle so that might be fine

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.490 
castle so that might be fine
we're<00:00:18.570> gonna<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:18.930> he<00:00:19.020> does<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.439> way

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
we're gonna see if he does it that way

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.529 
we're gonna see if he does it that way
though<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.640> pretty<00:00:20.820> difficult<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.330> make

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
though and it's pretty difficult to make

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.820 
though and it's pretty difficult to make
sure<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> golems<00:00:22.289> go<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> right<00:00:22.650> way

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
sure that you golems go the right way

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.109 
sure that you golems go the right way
because<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.310> always<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
because you always have to be in a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
because you always have to be in a
certain<00:00:24.300> way<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> looks<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.590> they're

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
certain way but it looks like they're

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.589 
certain way but it looks like they're
going<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.250> they're<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.029> super<00:00:27.359> jump

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
going for it they're gonna super jump

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.269 
going for it they're gonna super jump
