00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
let me move this away so we have more

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.179 
let me move this away so we have more
space<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.789> what<00:01:57.209> is<00:01:57.359> yet<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.749> come<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.319> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
space for what is yet to come and the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.550 
space for what is yet to come and the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
base that will go along with this which

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.719

is<00:02:03.749> the<00:02:04.079> whipping<00:02:04.829> cream<00:02:04.859> we'll<00:02:05.249> get<00:02:05.490> our

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
is the whipping cream we'll get our

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.569 
is the whipping cream we'll get our
mixer<00:02:06.240> started

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
mixer started

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.920
