hello Nancy today I am going to try to
put<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> warp<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.730> for<00:00:06.359> my<00:00:06.480> loom<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.930> see<00:00:07.200> over

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
put a warp on for my loom I see over

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.110 
put a warp on for my loom I see over
here<00:00:07.880> you<00:00:08.880> know<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.269> finished<00:00:09.660> my<00:00:11.090> when<00:00:12.090> I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120

here you know when I finished my when I
saw<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.900> other<00:00:14.240> warp<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.570> left<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.910> left<00:00:17.910> part<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
saw the other warp I left I left part of

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.830 
saw the other warp I left I left part of
it<00:00:18.810> still<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.300> now<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it still on there so now I'm going to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.390 
it still on there so now I'm going to
tie<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> new<00:00:22.560> warp<00:00:22.830> on

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
tie a new warp on

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.080 
tie a new warp on
first<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.720> create<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.380> new<00:00:25.410> warp<00:00:26.090> so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
first I have to create the new warp so

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.500 
first I have to create the new warp so
there<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.720> lovely<00:00:28.199> thing<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:30.300> then

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
there is this lovely thing here and then

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.150 
there is this lovely thing here and then
you<00:00:30.750> may<00:00:31.430> think<00:00:32.430> again<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> main<00:00:34.160> floor

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you may think again on the main floor

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.970 
you may think again on the main floor
got<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.090> ground<00:00:37.489> you<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:42.680> never<00:00:43.680> use

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
got the ground you see now I never use

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:59.720 
got the ground you see now I never use
the<00:00:44.250> warping<00:00:44.730> mill<00:00:45.000> before

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.340 

okay<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.030> let's<00:01:01.330> make<00:01:01.570> sure<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.870> have<00:01:01.900> it<00:01:02.170> where

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
okay so let's make sure we have it where

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.950 
okay so let's make sure we have it where
I<00:01:02.380> can<00:01:02.910> turn<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.269> don't<00:01:04.420> think<00:01:04.510> it's<00:01:04.750> going

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
I can turn it I don't think it's going

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.500 
I can turn it I don't think it's going
to<00:01:05.019> be<00:01:05.170> oh<00:01:05.790> yes<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:06.970> will<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.210> will<00:01:07.270> work<00:01:07.479> just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
to be oh yes it will it will work just

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:24.330 
to be oh yes it will it will work just
fine<00:01:08.460> no<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.490> think<00:01:09.790> have<00:01:10.510> you<00:01:10.690> tighten<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.380> now

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:36.109 

and<00:01:25.140> not<00:01:26.140> sure<00:01:26.380> just<00:01:26.619> how<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.829> tighten<00:01:27.250> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:46.020 

take<00:01:37.119> more<00:01:37.450> trouble<00:01:37.810> than<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:44.880> guess<00:01:45.880> I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
take more trouble than that so guess I

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.840 
take more trouble than that so guess I
need<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.240> get<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.600> right<00:01:46.810> size<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.520> thing<00:01:54.729> in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
need to get the right size that thing in

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.550 
need to get the right size that thing in
there<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.250> now<00:01:57.459> where<00:01:57.819> do<00:01:58.119> we<00:01:58.240> keep<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.539> tools

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
there so now where do we keep the tools

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.380 
there so now where do we keep the tools
oh<00:02:01.020> she<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.289> Cody<00:02:02.799> was<00:02:03.580> telling<00:02:04.119> someone

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
oh she do it Cody was telling someone

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.600 
oh she do it Cody was telling someone
today<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.899> said<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.350> know<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.340> are<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.490> my

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
today I said you know if you are in my

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.830 
today I said you know if you are in my
house<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:07.060> could<00:02:07.209> probably<00:02:07.360> figure<00:02:07.689> out

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
house you could probably figure out

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.749 
house you could probably figure out
exactly<00:02:08.019> would<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.590> able<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.069> say<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.340> could<00:02:09.610> say

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
exactly would be able to say I could say

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.089 
exactly would be able to say I could say
go<00:02:09.910> get<00:02:10.030> Lister<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.650> lay<00:02:11.799> your<00:02:11.830> hands

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
go get Lister that just lay your hands

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.860 
go get Lister that just lay your hands
right<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.930> right<00:02:14.110> size<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:15.750> bet<00:02:16.750> it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
right on it not the right size I bet it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.710 
right on it not the right size I bet it
is<00:02:17.970> what<00:02:18.970> does<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.239> say

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.760 

9/16<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:22.900> probably<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> wrong<00:02:23.380> one<00:02:23.620> I'm

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
9/16 it's probably the wrong one I'm

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:38.040 
9/16 it's probably the wrong one I'm
pretty<00:02:24.010> -<00:02:32.520> hey<00:02:33.520> it's<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> right<00:02:34.030> one<00:02:37.050> okay

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
pretty - hey it's the right one okay

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.950 
pretty - hey it's the right one okay
well<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.410> guess<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.770> need<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:40.570> at<00:02:40.750> once<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.750> top

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
well I guess I need to at once the top

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.410 
well I guess I need to at once the top
and<00:02:44.170> one<00:02:44.290> turn<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.740> bottom<00:02:45.010> right<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.460> just

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and one turn the bottom right I just

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.220 
and one turn the bottom right I just
found<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.780> most<00:02:46.900> interesting<00:02:47.320> site<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.480> had<00:02:49.810> I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
found the most interesting site it had I

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.100 
found the most interesting site it had I
think<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.860> was<00:02:51.750> basket<00:02:52.750> makers<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.330> best

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
think it was basket makers the best

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.820 
think it was basket makers the best
that's<00:02:56.980> me<00:02:57.280> all<00:02:57.640> over<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.270> don't<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.600> was

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
that's me all over I don't know it was

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.750 
that's me all over I don't know it was
it's<00:02:59.830> very<00:02:59.890> interesting<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.800> number<00:03:03.100> 15

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
it's very interesting that so number 15

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840 
it's very interesting that so number 15
I<00:03:04.120> don't<00:03:04.360> know<00:03:04.480> what<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:05.670> other<00:03:06.670> ones

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
I don't know what that is other ones

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.960 
I don't know what that is other ones
seemed<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.330> work<00:03:08.160> five<00:03:09.160> eight<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.730> was<00:03:09.850> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
seemed to work five eight so it was the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:24.360 
seemed to work five eight so it was the
last<00:03:10.180> one<00:03:10.510> 9/16<00:03:12.240> that's<00:03:13.240> five<00:03:13.600> eight<00:03:13.870> one<00:03:23.370> five

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
last one 9/16 that's five eight one five

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.830 
last one 9/16 that's five eight one five
a<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.820> got<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> lot<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.180> 5/8<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.959> guess<00:03:26.700> well<00:03:27.840> if

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
a so I got a lot of 5/8 I guess well if

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.540 
a so I got a lot of 5/8 I guess well if
that<00:03:29.050> one's<00:03:29.260> 9/16<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.220> 5/8<00:03:30.640> hasn't<00:03:30.970> been<00:03:31.090> work

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.820 

we<00:03:38.550> can<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:41.870> no<00:03:42.870> see<00:03:43.230> now<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> know<00:03:43.530> for

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
we can just see no see now I know for

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:52.400 
we can just see no see now I know for
sure<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.070> does<00:03:44.220> arc<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:50.810> those<00:03:51.810> are<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.260> wrong

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
sure it does arc so those are the wrong

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.390 
sure it does arc so those are the wrong
