at<00:01:16.110> your<00:01:16.350> reflection<00:01:21.710> next<00:01:22.710> guy<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.100> little

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
at your reflection next guy is a little

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
at your reflection next guy is a little
bit<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> classical<00:01:24.119> feel<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.990> after

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bit of a classical feel to it so after

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:36.130 
bit of a classical feel to it so after
you<00:01:26.310> went<00:01:26.810> from<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:33.470> flowering<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> hand<00:01:34.950> up

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
you went from here flowering the hand up

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:50.620 
you went from here flowering the hand up
back<00:01:37.159> up<00:01:38.159> back<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.530> distance<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:41.009> two

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.600 

and<00:01:51.630> we'll<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> heel<00:01:52.350> lift<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.130> one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and we'll do the heel lift so it's one

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.069 
and we'll do the heel lift so it's one
two<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:55.070> four<00:01:56.299> hands<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.810> up

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
two three four hands are going to go up

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.250 
two three four hands are going to go up
out<00:01:58.829> down

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
out down

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.300 
out down
so<00:02:02.260> that's<00:02:02.440> one<00:02:02.680> two<00:02:03.370> three<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:05.710> vary<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.040> is

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
so that's one two three can vary that is

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.820 
so that's one two three can vary that is
mean<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:06.970> we're<00:02:07.330> gonna<00:02:07.420> keep<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.840> below<00:02:07.990> thumb

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
mean but we're gonna keep it below thumb

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.580 
mean but we're gonna keep it below thumb
and<00:02:09.009> two<00:02:09.130> fingers<00:02:09.160> come<00:02:09.700> together<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> deer

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
and two fingers come together for a deer

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.010 
and two fingers come together for a deer
and<00:02:11.980> flower<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.330> you're<00:02:13.450> staying<00:02:13.690> well<00:02:13.900> as

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and flower and you're staying well as

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.380 
and flower and you're staying well as
your<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:14.440> two<00:02:15.010> three<00:02:15.670> one<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.240> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
your one two three one of the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.740 
your one two three one of the
simplification<00:02:17.170> we're<00:02:17.350> still<00:02:17.590> punching

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
simplification we're still punching

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.110 
simplification we're still punching
think<00:02:19.750> twice<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.980> let's<00:02:21.250> do<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.490> together

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
think twice so let's do it together

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:36.350 
think twice so let's do it together
with<00:02:22.470> tax<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:25.030> two<00:02:25.600> three

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.610 

here<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:39.220> two<00:02:39.489> three<00:02:39.760> one<00:02:40.300> two<00:02:40.450> three<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
here here one two three one two three so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.300 
here here one two three one two three so
from<00:02:44.860> here<00:02:44.890> there's<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.550> little<00:02:45.820> side<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.750> side

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
from here there's a little side to side

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.300 
from here there's a little side to side
one<00:02:48.310> two<00:02:50.040> four<00:02:51.040> steps<00:02:51.910> together<00:02:52.180> using<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.560> to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
one two four steps together using it to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:12.930 
one two four steps together using it to
push<00:03:05.580> last<00:03:06.580> time<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:10.709> fa<00:03:11.709> a--<00:03:11.940> sequence

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
push last time and the fa a-- sequence

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.479 
push last time and the fa a-- sequence
if<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.330> read<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.630> schedule<00:03:13.840> before<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.799> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
last step to end it will be your hands

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.699 
last step to end it will be your hands
