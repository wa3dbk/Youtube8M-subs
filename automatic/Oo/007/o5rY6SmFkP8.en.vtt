think helps though with this because
this<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:14.930> almost<00:03:15.319> feels<00:03:15.799> like<00:03:15.889> forming<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
this is almost feels like forming on the

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.030 
this is almost feels like forming on the
stage

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
stage

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.000 
stage
