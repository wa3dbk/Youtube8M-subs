00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello dear viewers with you glen you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 see the review of the car from March 3, not for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.820
 I will light the gate in the game before starting the review 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 I would like to draw your attention to the new 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.679
 group vkontakte on the game for the crew and forza 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 horizon 2 distinguishes this group from others 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.940
 in that in this group I really will 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.100
 roll timely timely news 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.680
 juicy pictures and various interesting 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 video recordings concerning the data of two games 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 link on the screen and in the description below the video 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.859
 aston martin zagato 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.420
 sports car british 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.579
 production which you can 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.620
 buy bought q in the square for the hook under 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.989
 called extreme faq in my opinion 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 it will give out better cars from this one 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.210
 so traditionally we start with the main 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.969
 basic characteristics power 510 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 horsepower and torque 570 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.050
 units rear maximum drive 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 speed of 305 kilometers per hour 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.660
 acceleration to 100 kilometers per hour in 4.2 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.910
 seconds looking at the look of the car 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 and comparing its basic characteristics with 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 others of the same class particular for and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 the same extreme while it seems that the car is not 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.010
 very suitable for victory but also for weights 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 never leave anything so simple 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.659
 after tuning aston martin zagato 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
 supercar on the first 3 seconds you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 feel that you are almost the leader of the race 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.290
 straight from the start 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.180
 but unfortunately in 10-15 seconds you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.000
 bypass you will hold third 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.830
 fourth perfect cornering you 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.409
 still get to the leader and you will 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.420
 already the second and everything seems fine but here 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.400
 if the leader of the race on the same laferrari 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 then on direct bypass it you have chances 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 just will not be but on the turn 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.540
 Still, he is because this is the thing 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.250
 for this machine also players who 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.400
 drive with settings for experienced players 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.049
 the car will love it and death for 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 the gate is capable of sharp turns 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.590
 well throw sideways 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 she usually enter no significant drift 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.930
 which is hardly noticed, but 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.420
 error standard will deploy 180 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.189
 degrees significant drawbacks in this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
 cars during the passage of various 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.649
 I did not find the tracks, the car is very good 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.210
 having straight arms is the only thing not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.719
 he will always have enough speed on 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.939
 direct 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.290
 in order to get to the race leader if 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.130
 the final by car with more 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.930
 maximum speed than you 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.550
 so the car I surveyed 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.470
 suitable for use at all 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.930
 tracks but preferably on those where 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.220
 turns more than take lovers 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.740
 ride first person 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.080
 car like nothing extra review 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.300
 misses the fold that beautiful interior and 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.120
 speedometer and the road is very good 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.770
 called from different angles 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.900
 tune cool marketing call it 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.870
 can not be monotonous but diverse 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.150
 also for example the front rear bumpers 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.880
 and the number of spoilers for a replacement for it 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.220
 enough but here as for the disks 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.610
 hood stickers in various colors for 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.290
 cars so this is another hemorrhoids 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.450
 permissible for replacement for this machine 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 no more than 40 percent of all that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.770
 offers us a game 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.770
 evaluation of aston martin gate machine food from 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.140
 7 points from 10 to plus and hit 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.570
 quick start and excellent handling 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.610
 Now, as for the minuses, you ask, yes 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.210
 cars are really very good but not 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.300
 perfect 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.490
 1 minus precisely because of speed speed 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.610
 good but not always allow you to be 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.840
 leader 2 minus overclocking pay 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.970
 attention to the monitor 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 as it â€™s not enough acceleration now 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.460
 in order to arrive first finish 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.250
 dash 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.170
 and the third as if we were not offended because 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.170
 limited tuning but this i think 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
 this machine can be forgiven 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.570
 use this particular aston martin 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.150
 recommend 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.660
 he is definitely better than the dodge and abortion of her 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.000
