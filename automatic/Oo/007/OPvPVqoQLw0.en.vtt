00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello friends today I will give them 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.850
 again the recipe for the dough because the 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.410
 previous video was a bit of very 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.800
 bad quality so I decided to improve it 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:23.140
 what we have here is three cups of 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:28.409
 Masea flour and minsa has to be 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.409
 corn flour for tortillas 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.079
 as you can see on the label says mass 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.640
 instant corn 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.640
 that is what we are going to occupy 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.990
 The first thing we are going to add to the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.740
 drier is 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.860
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.900
 if you break much much 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.750
 the tortillas and of plane can not 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.700
 I recommend you to put them 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.920
 a little piece of lime is a very, very, very 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.010
 small and that's going to make your 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.650
 tortillas come out better 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.370
 then that will only be done if 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.560
 do not leave the tortillas 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.440
 what we are going to do next is that you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.380
 let's add water 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.850
 the water must be warm 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.969
 If the water is cold they will not come out 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.810
 very well they are going to break a lot and if 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.460
 the water is boiling the dough is going 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.159
 to be very cycles to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.909
 then the water must be of 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.010
 warm preference that is one of the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.100
 basic things that you should do 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.259
 so that the tortillas go well 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.640
 for these three cups of flour I'm going to 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.790
 occupy two and three quarters of water 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 that is, two cups and three fourths apart 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.080
 parts 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.570
 They are almost three cups 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.160
 this are the measures that I took 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.760
 so that the dough stayed in the point 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.470
 as always for some reason the mass does not 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.040
 always with the same amounts 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.440
 I do not know if I have to see the brand or I do not know 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.280
 then that's precisely why I 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:26.000
 I'm adding water little by little 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.140
 because if you go over the water then you 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.090
 they're going to have to put flour and so 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.330
 then the most advisable thing is that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.700
 you go kneading the dough with your 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.510
 hands go feeling the consistency 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.060
 they are gradually adding water and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.250
 when you have a mixture 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.960
 manageable that is not too hard 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.690
 and that is not very watery 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.450
 then is when they will stop being 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 adding water and they will mix everything 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.879
 very well 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:10.159
 if they are going to be huaraches sopes quesadillas 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.670
 they have to add oil to the dough 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:16.240
 that is another 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.620
 another tip that I'm giving you if you go to 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.450
 to make huaraches sopes quesadillas of yes 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.150
 they're going to let's say if they're going to make three cups 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.450
 of flour at least you have to 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.750
 add a quarter cup of oil and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.790
 then they add the water 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.770
 and this will make your dough 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.750
 they fit very well 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.960
 to pay for what we are going to do 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.280
 if nothing else they will be tortillas nothing more 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.560
 use water and salt then how 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.640
 can you see I'm moving kimi and 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.240
 massa is already manageable 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:01.819
 Stop pouring water 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:06.630
 and now I'm going to show you I'm going to take 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:11.270
 a portion of dough to see 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.270
 how is it that the coast should be 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.270
 you can see they can grab a 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.970
 portion 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.150
 with a finger you are pricked and it feels very 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.220
 hard that is not yet and its 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.220
 tortillas are not going to inflate like that 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.250
 so work with her 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.420
 and as it is if they happen of water I do not go it 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.400
 to see very watered down and at the moment 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.730
 you make an omelet do not know 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.100
 will be able to 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.400
 [Music] 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.440
 take out of the plastic why 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.080
 because it is very watery then they will 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.020
 have to throw more flour 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.710
 so good that's how I make 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.330
 dough 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.939
 [Music] 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.009
 I hope you serve me video 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.889
 I would like you to comment a little more on the 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.080
 qualifying videos is very important 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.400
 that 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.610
 that they also subscribe if they wish and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.610
 Well, see you until the next video
