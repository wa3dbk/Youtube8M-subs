00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.640
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.560
 in the fifth episode of the podium making art 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.600
 I bring you a project, will you? 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.640
 even very different that changed the face 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.310
 from my kitchen as our apartment 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.140
 here is rented I decided to cook stove 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.910
 to change the environment a bit because 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.190
 it was too white and too bland 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.530
 but I have already explained all this in the post 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.810
 prior to this if you did not see it occurs 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.579
 there on the poc blog and I see this post for 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.370
 to understand what I 'm talking about 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.650
 but then get to work for this project 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.660
 You 'll need time on the stove in good 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.020
 state of white preference and without 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.250
 rust a piece of steel sponge a 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.580
 damp cloth 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 see the latest degreaser the newspaper 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.240
 many newspaper tape crepe scissors ink 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.580
 high temperature spray 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.920
 I used this red dye brand 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.170
 if your cooker is connected and 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.750
 open the windows of the place and in 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.430
 and then close the gas register with the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 careful to choose the hose 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.020
 gas in the back of the stove 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.780
 now comes the boring part to clean 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.579
 he takes the buttons off the stove and lips 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.399
 with detergent sport to remove the 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.350
 using aluminum and I 'll see 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.109
 cleaning the few sides and front of the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.850
 your stove if necessary 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.979
 carefully remove the steel sponge 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.920
 remove the toughest fats 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.649
 Also link the front of the glass of 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.659
 and the inside of your stove 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.729
 this part is very important because your 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.409
 stove and get an earring otherwise 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.569
 subtract some grease from the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.229
 be adrift and may leave with much 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.850
 ease the Olympic goal we will now 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.249
 for the fun part 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.950
 Carlos will help me on the project and then 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.810
 she came to sneer that we too like us 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.389
 live in the apartment were all 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.819
 our laundry with the floor and the 

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:06.069
 walls up to 50 cm above the 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.760
 height of the stove to think only he 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.920
 and not 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.479
 then we were very careful 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.330
 covering the parts that would remain with the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.970
 original color as the front glass to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.740
 part of nox and top glass 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.210
 eyes and parts very carefully 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.220
 so that it does not lose any trace of 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.890
 Paint and work is done well. 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.750
 now just start painting, we follow the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.270
 instructions from the manufacturer of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.800
 we can shake her for three minutes and 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.900
 we apply a distance of 30 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.820
 centimeters of surface 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.760
 always making constant movements and 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.740
 make a uniform reciprocating movement is 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.170
 very important for waste to be 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.140
 filled with thin layers of tim case 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.120
 otherwise the inter will circulate and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.670
 trickling down the surface 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.590
 now we just paint everything we use one 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.600
 little more than a paint can 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.240
 let it dry for at least three hours 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.070
 before returning him to the place but 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.750
 You'll have to wait for the oven to wait. 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.070
 six hours for the paint to dry 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.860
 completely 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.480
 it is normal to get a strong smell of paint 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.740
 the first time you use the oven 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.110
 Do not worry 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.870
 now in the box the buttons and ready your 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.720
 colorful new leaf is too much 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.250
 it seems like a toy of a lifetime to 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.080
 my kitchen that was all white she 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.690
 it was wonderful 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.520
 I 'm in love with my stove I like 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.260
 would do in your kitchen as well. 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.480
 so while down here in 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.489
 comments your opinion and do not forget 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.530
 from there on the blog check the debut of 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.660
 frame poc runs and see posts about 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.430

 tv to receive the updates first 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.080
 share videos on social networks 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.160
 to show this idea to others 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.220
 people 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:04:04.929
