00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.570 
only thing I will say is unfortunately a
rainbow<00:03:24.900> broke<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> bit<00:03:25.590> as<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.130> see<00:03:26.370> in

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
rainbow broke a bit as you can see in

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.490 
rainbow broke a bit as you can see in
places<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.330> think<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.260> obviously

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
places and I think this is obviously

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.290 
places and I think this is obviously
just<00:03:28.710> because<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.340> postage<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.030> don't<00:03:30.210> know

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
just because of the postage I don't know

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.760 
just because of the postage I don't know
if<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.570> post<00:03:30.810> office<00:03:30.990> for<00:03:31.290> being<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> bit<00:03:31.650> too

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
if the post office for being a bit too

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.250 
if the post office for being a bit too
rose<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:33.000> think<00:03:33.330> one<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.660> reasons<00:03:33.810> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
rose and I think one of the reasons is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.840 
rose and I think one of the reasons is
because<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:34.830> not<00:03:34.980> very<00:03:35.130> much<00:03:35.340> behind<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
because it's not very much behind the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.490 
because it's not very much behind the
very<00:03:36.060> top<00:03:36.270> of<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.450> rainbow<00:03:36.660> as<00:03:36.990> you<00:03:37.110> can<00:03:37.290> see

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
very top of the rainbow as you can see

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.010 
very top of the rainbow as you can see
so<00:03:38.010> when<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> push<00:03:38.460> down<00:03:38.700> its<00:03:38.910> innate<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:39.960> it

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
so when I push down its innate it so it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.080 
so when I push down its innate it so it
bends<00:03:40.290> backwards<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.890> bit<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.370> maybe<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.730> little

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
bends backwards a bit so maybe a little

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.520 
bends backwards a bit so maybe a little
bit<00:03:42.270> more<00:03:42.390> cream<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:42.900> underneath<00:03:43.200> where

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
bit more cream just underneath where

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.720 
bit more cream just underneath where
you're<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.740> to<00:03:43.800> put<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.040> rainbow<00:03:44.370> right

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
you're going to put the rainbow right

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.180 
you're going to put the rainbow right

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
doesn't matter and also it just it means

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.890 
doesn't matter and also it just it means
that<00:04:32.650> it's<00:04:32.820> easier<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.940> find<00:04:34.210> in<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.479> big<00:04:34.660> bag

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900

that it's easier to find in a big bag
you're<00:04:35.380> less<00:04:35.590> likely<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:36.040> lose<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.669> because

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
you're less likely to lose it because

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.400 
you're less likely to lose it because
it's<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.389> like<00:04:37.780> big<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.300> bold<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.930> can't<00:04:41.200> miss

for one like this I don't know I don't
think<00:05:05.260> all<00:05:05.500> phones<00:05:06.010> have<00:05:07.050> cases<00:05:08.050> way<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.440> get

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
think all phones have cases way to get

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.950 
think all phones have cases way to get
them<00:05:08.919> colored<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:10.120> know<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.330> phones<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.930> can

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
them colored and I know I phones you can

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.330 
them colored and I know I phones you can
easily<00:05:11.380> get<00:05:11.919> colored<00:05:12.280> cases<00:05:12.700> like<00:05:12.910> this<00:05:14.340> but

pretty<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.430> don't<00:05:36.729> know<00:05:36.820> whether<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.060> would<00:05:37.180> sit

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
pretty I don't know whether I would sit

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.980 
pretty I don't know whether I would sit
the<00:05:37.660> shorts<00:05:37.990> or<00:05:38.110> not<00:05:38.260> but<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:39.600> think<00:05:40.600> they<00:05:40.810> would

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
the shorts or not but I think they would

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.240 
the shorts or not but I think they would
suit<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.320> lot<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.650> people<00:05:41.830> um<00:05:42.610> anyway<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:45.220> was

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
suit a lot of people um anyway that was

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.670 
suit a lot of people um anyway that was
my<00:05:45.400> review<00:05:45.729> I<00:05:45.970> would<00:05:46.330> say<00:05:46.630> that<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.530> should

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680

definitely<00:05:47.860> check<00:05:48.039> out<00:05:48.220> her<00:05:48.460> stuff<00:05:48.729> at<00:05:48.880> least

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
and her stuff and maybe even get a case

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.620 
and her stuff and maybe even get a case
i'm<00:06:03.099> not<00:06:03.340> entirely<00:06:03.639> sure<00:06:03.789> what<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.240> prices

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
i'm not entirely sure what the prices

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.590 
i'm not entirely sure what the prices
are

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
are

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.890 
are
but<00:06:06.600> this<00:06:07.610> this<00:06:08.610> did<00:06:08.940> should<00:06:09.210> help<00:06:09.419> pretty

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
but this this did should help pretty

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.520 
but this this did should help pretty
quickly<00:06:10.199> I<00:06:10.320> think<00:06:10.440> it<00:06:10.710> was<00:06:10.860> within<00:06:11.100> a<00:06:11.250> week<00:06:11.550> and

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
quickly I think it was within a week and

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.830 
quickly I think it was within a week and
after<00:06:13.530> she<00:06:14.040> said<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.490> she<00:06:14.639> shifted<00:06:15.060> out<00:06:15.210> so

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
after she said that she shifted out so

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.219 
after she said that she shifted out so
um<00:06:17.090> so<00:06:18.090> yeah<00:06:18.270> it<00:06:18.389> did<00:06:18.570> come<00:06:18.750> very<00:06:18.960> quickly

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
um so yeah it did come very quickly

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.400 
um so yeah it did come very quickly
which<00:06:19.620> was<00:06:19.770> very<00:06:19.919> good<00:06:20.840> it's<00:06:21.840> just<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.199> shame

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
which was very good it's just a shame

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.110 
which was very good it's just a shame
that<00:06:22.470> the<00:06:22.740> rainbow<00:06:23.130> broke<00:06:23.430> a<00:06:23.460> bit<00:06:23.729> that's<00:06:23.940> all

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
that the rainbow broke a bit that's all

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.750 
that the rainbow broke a bit that's all
but<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.479> can<00:06:24.690> fix<00:06:24.870> that<00:06:25.020> it's<00:06:25.290> no<00:06:25.470> problem<00:06:25.889> so
