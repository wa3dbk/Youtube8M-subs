00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.840
 because such friends on this occasion then 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.200
 I welcome you to this 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.959
 triple review of these new series 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.839
 that has been launching hasbro makes a 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.020
 couple of months ago this back and they've been 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.780
 recently arriving in Mexico and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.150
 Well now they are very wanted 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.620
 all these two series I hope for 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.710
 there do not take long those of 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.050
 spider-man also look good in a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.719
 that another of those figures and well then in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.160
 this time I have what are two 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.790
 figures from the series of tanos 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.930
 and because it would be from the series of the father of 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 all or as you want to call 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.270
 so that the checks but I'm not going to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.140
 dazzle so much what is the light of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.989
 the camera 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.640
 if you ask me then this is a figure 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.230
 I liked that I liked the size is almost 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.110
 almost as a A sudden what already 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.449
 the figure that they had already made a 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.450
 year I do not seem to remember which series 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.820
 it was but it's very much like a 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.270
 only they changed around this 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.640
 color and if they implemented a couple of 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.450
 little things but what I would like it to be 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.409
 take a look at what is mine the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.929
 Mir or the hammer 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.929
 Well with a detail almost almost 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.689
 throwing him a bad look at marvel select 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.679
 in which it is pretty good but 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.289
 there is the blister with the logo of 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.340
 avengers I will recline the figure for 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.369
 show them the ulster 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.460
 for this the piece under this side then 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.460
 they bring an illustration of everything quite 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.380
 father and this side then a description and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.439
 the other complete series 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.289
 I will move everyone to leave here and 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.149
 Well, here is also the good 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.850
 iron man I really liked this 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.750
 figure although I already know that it is in his 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.789
 whole one a sudden but then for 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.990
 I'm worth this figure because I already 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.490
 that brings the change of head 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.819
 will show 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.379
 What is this Tony Stark? 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.379
 I hope I can focus well there 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 it's fine if they ask me what 's good 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.360
 the sculpted for me I like that they have 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.240
 that you have included this extra face 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.150
 It looks pretty father I like me 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.160
 I would have liked it to be a little more 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.190
 May number or something but still 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.890
 is fine and although that is the same 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.500
 sea ​​mold of the sea 42 only you 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.430
 they changed what is the color in the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.560
 chest and torso 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.769
 but I really liked it because 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.580
 I'm a fan of ironman ironman because if I 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.500
 he liked quite 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.420
 here I show you quickly what 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.710
 is the other helmet that is the regular 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.710
 same here an image of the sea 43 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.190
 back here in a pose 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.040
 and the rest of the series equal 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.470
 and then a difference between the logos is 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.200
 that it only says avenger if it's 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.090
 if it says that filter 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.709
 and what strikes me most is that 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.850
 the only guy the logo sorry the 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.700
 avengers is 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.370
 it's almost the same 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.099
 and well , this side was hölck 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.760
 which for me is the best in the series 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.840
 Tanos was a big checkbook and her face 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.970
 really that the face fascinated me 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.480
 quite if the previous figure that 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.390
 they took out exclusive for walmart I liked it 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.630
 enough is the surpassed then 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.790
 broadly you can really check there 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.090
 the sculpted of his face is quite 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.090
 good 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.690
 and well, really, if it is 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.010
 They looked with this figure as it is not a 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.740
 is a good reuse of recycled 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.300
 body of the previous one but for example 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.239
 the torso and what is the chest is 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.780
 totally different arms I think 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.109
 which are the same, inclusive of the 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.930
 fists 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.689
 obviously the other left fist 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.030
 it seems or right brings the hand semi 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:32.470
 open 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.470
 and well, bring here 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.660
 sumaya with the logo and avengers 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.060
 and very small 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.550
 and well it brings textures what 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.470
 which is the part of the pants is put 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.480
 writer out there 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.340
 and well I really liked it too 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.410
 that it looks good also another part that is 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.020
 reused from the other mold is the 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.000
 knees down I think but of 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.800
 there in out is therefore a mold totally 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.569
 different 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.849
 and well, I'll show what is the 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:15.060
 price out there in liverpool they already arrived 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:16.560
 in 389 baros to go out there the one that 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.590
 go searching for them to bring you 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.880
 and liverpool's and well then the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.010
 hold image, I liked it a lot 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.200
 Like a picture here that here looks 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.870
 something chafes this image 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.160
 but well, really, that the figure 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.140
 itself was pretty good 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.870
 and good to quickly gather the comparison of 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.810
 size to check out there though 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.620
 the bull is quite big 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.729
 after which he continues to overcome 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.919
 for one more chunk and they could get to tony 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.250
 stark once I hope you liked it 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.110
 this little quick review of these 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.080
 three figures for today wait the others 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.330
 I'm going to be uploading the rest 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.699
 figures and then to see if I encourage 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.880
 malata us and to interest well in other 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.880
 video
