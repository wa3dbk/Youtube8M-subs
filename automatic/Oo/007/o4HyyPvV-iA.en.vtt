00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
this is down but he's wire model is here

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.610 
this is down but he's wire model is here
now<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.390> see<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.660> was<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.170> ship<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.560> you

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.290 

Architects<00:06:00.780> in<00:06:00.960> London<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:01.910> they<00:06:02.910> wanted<00:06:03.210> to

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
Architects in London and they wanted to

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.900 
Architects in London and they wanted to
do<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.570> same<00:06:03.810> thing<00:06:04.080> but<00:06:04.470> with<00:06:04.730> digital<00:06:05.730> tools

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
do the same thing but with digital tools

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:14.060 
do the same thing but with digital tools
and<00:06:06.390> so<00:06:07.110> they<00:06:07.380> took<00:06:07.650> tools<00:06:09.680> like<00:06:10.680> right

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.320 

and<00:06:15.120> applied<00:06:16.120> some<00:06:18.060> computational<00:06:19.060> scripts

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
and applied some computational scripts

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.980 
and applied some computational scripts
and<00:06:19.540> parameters<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.410> it<00:06:21.100> allowed<00:06:21.400> them<00:06:21.610> to

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
and parameters and it allowed them to

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.540 
and parameters and it allowed them to
explore<00:06:22.990> very<00:06:23.350> freely<00:06:23.710> all<00:06:24.070> these<00:06:24.220> different

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
explore very freely all these different

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
explore very freely all these different
architectural<00:06:25.120> forms<00:06:25.540> and<00:06:27.300> really<00:06:28.300> take

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
architectural forms and really take

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.390 
architectural forms and really take
those<00:06:28.840> same<00:06:29.140> techniques<00:06:29.620> that<00:06:29.800> people<00:06:30.250> have

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
those same techniques that people have

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.480 
those same techniques that people have
used<00:06:30.540> in<00:06:31.540> the<00:06:31.690> analog<00:06:32.020> world<00:06:32.200> using<00:06:32.950> physical
