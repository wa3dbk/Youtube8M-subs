this is just the paddle pretty simple
self<00:00:44.280> explanatory<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:46.170> guess<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.430> with

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
self explanatory I guess all you do with

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970 
self explanatory I guess all you do with
this<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.090> pop<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.980> this

this you just pop it in like this this
end<00:00:50.340> goes<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:52.500> course<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.980> two

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
end goes on here of course you have two

end goes on here of course you have two
of<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.460> paddles<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:55.320> that's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of these paddles so I think that's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860 
of these paddles so I think that's
pretty<00:00:55.770> easy<00:00:55.920> too<00:00:56.399> ok<00:00:57.030> I've<00:00:57.149> got<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> boat<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
pretty easy too ok I've got the boat on

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
pretty easy too ok I've got the boat on
the<00:00:57.960> ground<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> length

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the ground here you can see the length

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
the ground here you can see the length
of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> thing<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.289> pretty<00:01:02.010> long

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
of the thing it's actually a pretty long

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I'm just going to quickly undo it here

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
I'll show you guys to inside a boat so

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
I'll show you guys to inside a boat so
this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.470> hand<00:01:14.070> pump<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.490> came<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this is the hand pump that came with the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is the hand pump that came with the
actually<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> guess<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.960> more<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.259> foot<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
actually I guess it's more of a foot in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.760 
actually I guess it's more of a foot in
hand<00:01:16.890> pump<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.549> came<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> boat<00:01:18.770> it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
hand pump that came with a boat it's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
hand pump that came with a boat it's
okay<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.580> actually<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.900> mean<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> works<00:01:22.500> pretty

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
okay it actually I mean it works pretty

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.429 
okay it actually I mean it works pretty
well<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.659> it's<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.810> Wonder<00:01:25.110> double

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
well if you it's like Wonder double

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
well if you it's like Wonder double
pumps<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.640> push<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.330> blows<00:01:27.509> out

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
pumps like when you push in it blows out

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.590 
pumps like when you push in it blows out
air<00:01:27.869> when<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.560> pull<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.310> also<00:01:30.030> blows<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.450> air

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
air when you pull it also blows out air

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
air when you pull it also blows out air
so<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.680> works<00:01:32.009> pretty<00:01:32.130> well<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so it actually works pretty well the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
so it actually works pretty well the
only<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> pump<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
only thing is with this pump is that if

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
only thing is with this pump is that if
you<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.610> pumping<00:01:36.060> too<00:01:36.210> hard<00:01:36.509> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you if you're pumping too hard it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
you if you're pumping too hard it's
really<00:01:37.020> easy<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:37.860> pull<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
really easy to like actually pull this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149 
really easy to like actually pull this
entire<00:01:38.850> chamber<00:01:39.210> off<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.950> done<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
entire chamber off and I've done that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
entire chamber off and I've done that
three<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.579> four<00:01:41.729> times<00:01:41.939> until<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.420> realized<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
three or four times until I realized to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
three or four times until I realized to
take<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> slow<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.700> does<00:01:45.030> work<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
take it slow but this does work but I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.950 
take it slow but this does work but I
recommend<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.790> buy<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> electric<00:01:48.720> pump

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
recommend that you buy the electric pump

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.740 
recommend that you buy the electric pump
because<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.350> works<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:49.829> faster<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.750> anyway

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because it works a lot faster so anyway

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.289 
because it works a lot faster so anyway
I<00:01:51.780> use<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.380> both<00:01:52.560> interchangeably<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I use them both interchangeably but the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.690 
I use them both interchangeably but the
electric<00:01:54.659> pump<00:01:54.890> definitely<00:01:55.890> founder<00:01:56.310> my<00:01:56.490> wife

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
electric pump definitely founder my wife

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880 
electric pump definitely founder my wife
reminded<00:01:57.299> me<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:58.079> does<00:01:58.350> come<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
reminded me that this does come with a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.240 
reminded me that this does come with a
manual<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.899> mean<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:01.979> think

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
manual so I mean I don't really think

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
manual so I mean I don't really think
you'll<00:02:02.430> need<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.240> pretty<00:02:03.479> easy

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you'll need it because it's pretty easy

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
you'll need it because it's pretty easy
to<00:02:03.869> figure<00:02:03.990> out<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.920> far<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.159> inflating<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to figure out as far as inflating the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.260 
to figure out as far as inflating the
boat<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.360> boat<00:02:06.540> has<00:02:06.719> three<00:02:07.229> air<00:02:07.439> chambers<00:02:08.270> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
boat the boat has three air chambers the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.930 
boat the boat has three air chambers the
first<00:02:09.539> air<00:02:09.780> chambers<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> bottom

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
first air chambers on the bottom

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.450 
first air chambers on the bottom
second<00:02:11.780> one<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.200> middle<00:02:12.530> one<00:02:12.680> third<00:02:13.250> ones

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
second one the middle one third ones

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.730 
second one the middle one third ones
outside<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.060> basically<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.540> inflate<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.200> you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
outside and basically to inflate it you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.470 
outside and basically to inflate it you
start<00:02:16.070> with<00:02:16.190> number<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.270> work<00:02:17.450> your

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
start with number one and then work your

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260 
start with number one and then work your
way<00:02:17.660> outward<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.350> that's<00:02:19.250> pretty<00:02:19.580> simple<00:02:19.850> so

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
way outward and that's pretty simple so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.700 
way outward and that's pretty simple so
I'm<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.050> start<00:02:21.170> working<00:02:21.320> on<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
I'm going to start working on the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:48.680 
I'm going to start working on the
inflation<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.520> then

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.930 

let<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> boat<00:02:49.989> inflated<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.620> didn't<00:02:50.950> go<00:02:51.099> quite

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
let the boat inflated I didn't go quite

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.360 
let the boat inflated I didn't go quite
as<00:02:51.970> stout<00:02:52.629> as<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:53.379> would<00:02:53.680> normally<00:02:53.950> because

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
as stout as I would normally because

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.589 
as stout as I would normally because
actually<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:54.879> think<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.090> getting<00:02:55.269> ready<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
actually I think it's getting ready to

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.930 
actually I think it's getting ready to
rain<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.930> me<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.800> anyway<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.580> can<00:02:57.790> see

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150 
rain on me here so anyway you can see
the<00:02:58.120> three<00:02:58.360> chambers<00:02:58.750> are<00:02:58.900> full<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.379> wanted<00:03:00.099> to

up<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.420> seat<00:03:52.690> with<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.019> hand<00:03:53.230> pump<00:03:53.440> I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
up the seat with the hand pump I

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.340 
up the seat with the hand pump I
actually<00:03:53.859> think<00:03:54.100> it's<00:03:54.250> easier<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:55.230> pump<00:03:56.230> it

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350

actually think it's easier to pump it
with<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> hand<00:03:56.829> pump<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.489> electric<00:03:57.910> pump

marine<00:05:48.770> battery<00:05:49.639> on<00:05:49.759> mondays<00:05:50.150> at<00:05:50.360> walmart<00:05:50.840> and

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
marine battery on mondays at walmart and

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.350 
marine battery on mondays at walmart and
roughly<00:05:52.129> the<00:05:52.250> way<00:05:52.370> this<00:05:52.520> works<00:05:52.789> with<00:05:53.180> these

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
roughly the way this works with these

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.209 
roughly the way this works with these
motors<00:05:53.810> at<00:05:54.409> least<00:05:54.560> this<00:05:54.710> is<00:05:54.860> how<00:05:54.979> it<00:05:55.129> was

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
motors at least this is how it was

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.240 
motors at least this is how it was
explained<00:05:55.699> to<00:05:55.819> me<00:05:55.909> like<00:05:56.629> this<00:05:56.750> is<00:05:56.930> a<00:05:56.960> 30<00:05:57.710> pound

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
explained to me like this is a 30 pound

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.869 
explained to me like this is a 30 pound
thrust<00:05:58.759> a<00:05:59.150> 30<00:05:59.779> pound<00:06:00.050> thrust<00:06:00.560> pulls<00:06:01.009> about<00:06:01.460> 30

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
thrust a 30 pound thrust pulls about 30

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.559 
thrust a 30 pound thrust pulls about 30
amp<00:06:02.180> hours<00:06:03.039> each<00:06:04.039> hour<00:06:04.400> on<00:06:04.729> its<00:06:04.940> highest

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
amp hours each hour on its highest

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.829 
amp hours each hour on its highest
setting<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.379> if<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.529> get<00:06:06.650> a<00:06:06.789> 40<00:06:07.789> or<00:06:07.819> 50<00:06:08.659> it's

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:08.839 
setting so if you get a 40 or 50 it's

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.899 
setting so if you get a 40 or 50 it's
going<00:06:08.960> to<00:06:09.050> pull<00:06:09.319> 40<00:06:09.680> ants<00:06:09.860> or<00:06:10.129> 50<00:06:10.430> amps<00:06:10.729> on<00:06:10.819> the

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
going to pull 40 ants or 50 amps on the

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.790 
going to pull 40 ants or 50 amps on the
highest<00:06:11.120> setting<00:06:11.509> in<00:06:12.080> the<00:06:12.139> longest<00:06:12.650> that

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
highest setting in the longest that

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.430 
highest setting in the longest that
we've<00:06:12.979> had<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.370> boat<00:06:13.550> out<00:06:13.930> my<00:06:14.930> wife<00:06:15.169> and<00:06:15.379> I

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
we've had the boat out my wife and I

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.200 
we've had the boat out my wife and I

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
brother so the three of us went out I

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.430 
brother so the three of us went out I
think<00:06:20.240> we<00:06:20.330> were<00:06:20.419> out<00:06:20.509> for<00:06:20.690> just<00:06:20.900> over<00:06:20.990> maybe

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
think we were out for just over maybe

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.110 
think we were out for just over maybe
three<00:06:21.770> three<00:06:22.129> and<00:06:22.159> a<00:06:22.250> half<00:06:22.279> hours<00:06:22.759> that<00:06:23.000> was

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
three three and a half hours that was

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.329 
three three and a half hours that was
about<00:06:23.360> as<00:06:23.539> long<00:06:23.750> as<00:06:23.960> I<00:06:24.080> felt<00:06:24.379> like<00:06:24.529> trying<00:06:24.830> on

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:25.339 
about as long as I felt like trying on

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.850 
about as long as I felt like trying on
this<00:06:26.000> battery<00:06:26.419> also<00:06:27.229> you're<00:06:27.500> going<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.680> need<00:06:27.830> a

this battery also you're going to need a

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.909 
this battery also you're going to need a
battery<00:06:28.310> charger<00:06:28.849> a<00:06:29.839> speed<00:06:30.439> charger<00:06:30.889> or

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
battery charger a speed charger or

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.350 
a motor mount and this is really simple
basically<00:06:41.469> because<00:06:42.469> I'm<00:06:42.620> not<00:06:42.770> in<00:06:42.919> the<00:06:43.009> water

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
basically because I'm not in the water

and all you have to do and the motors

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.760 
and all you have to do and the motors
really<00:06:47.419> lie<00:06:47.569> I<00:06:47.779> mean<00:06:47.930> it<00:06:48.050> just<00:06:48.080> lists<00:06:48.620> just

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
really lie I mean it just lists just

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.219 
really lie I mean it just lists just
slides<00:06:49.009> right<00:06:49.159> on<00:06:49.279> like<00:06:49.610> this<00:06:49.759> and<00:06:50.000> it's<00:06:50.990> mount

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
slides right on like this and it's mount

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.999 
slides right on like this and it's mount

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
where this goes so follow me around to

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.570 
where this goes so follow me around to
the<00:06:58.490> back<00:06:58.669> of<00:06:58.819> the<00:06:58.879> boat

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.100 

in<00:07:02.349> the<00:07:03.349> motor<00:07:03.560> mounts<00:07:04.659> basically<00:07:05.659> hooks<00:07:05.930> in

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
in the motor mounts basically hooks in

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.619 
in the motor mounts basically hooks in
the<00:07:06.139> back<00:07:06.409> like<00:07:06.680> that<00:07:06.919> and<00:07:07.280> then<00:07:07.909> you<00:07:08.300> can<00:07:08.479> just

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629 
the back like that and then you can just

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.779

slide<00:07:08.840> your<00:07:08.870> motor<00:07:09.229> down<00:07:09.470> and<00:07:09.830> then<00:07:10.550> what<00:07:10.759> i

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
slide your motor down and then what i

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.839 
slide your motor down and then what i
usually<00:07:11.090> do<00:07:11.710> with<00:07:12.710> the<00:07:12.830> battery<00:07:13.280> i<00:07:13.400> set<00:07:13.759> the

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849 
usually do with the battery i set the

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.270 
usually do with the battery i set the
battery<00:07:14.210> next<00:07:14.689> to<00:07:14.840> me<00:07:14.960> on<00:07:15.169> the<00:07:15.199> seat<00:07:15.590> it<00:07:15.919> is<00:07:16.250> a
