00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.569
 Halo is 2 and I want to come back 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.639
 tutorial and I have 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.389
 recently uploaded a video 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 with that miss bayern that I go to 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.039
 started at night and that is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.090
 yes a world the crate so all this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.820
 But it is written in the air 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 summoned or so and there was none 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 floor and I will show you how to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.060
 such a bottomless world power 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.060
 So later set new world create 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 No, I want you to be creative 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 because otherwise it's pretty stupid that way 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 long ago and then dies and dies and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.510
 he would be on everyone the whole time 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 make a creative case 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.840
 meditation so it's going so far 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 unfortunately you have to be able to do it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.199
 of course , that makes it villages 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.149
 then it has and then it will be down there 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 and so you can too 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.559
 if you really act completely 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 then he would have to make it out 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.030
 I would have on 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.390
 bonustrack a rolling generated there 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.830
 I do not know why then 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.150
 make it super flat 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.290
 you can see that this is different 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.619
 probably just could all 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 Remove layers 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.159
 but that does not work then yes 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 templates 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 then you see here this is the template 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.299
 out that the above only wild is us 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 pay this is the template for the village 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.040
 for the flat world goes on the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.630
 Number pull what you yourself one 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 mauszeiger not I know that yes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 it works differently 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 seven, the bedrock is the lowest 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.140
 schicht there goes now the idea sanded 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.200
 and how to find the idea there is in 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 Internet are only a part of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 internet out on google has been like that again 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.619
 funny picture because I give mine now 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.759
 force the idea of the supreme can is their 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.989
 Take that because there is a good idea here 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.989
 scorsese sand is the 12th 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.600
 then I give here where the seven is for 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 I just give the gumpelstadt 12 14 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.620
 12 1 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.240
 I have to pay attention to the others 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.070
 If he could, he could 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.870
 give any idea of inner block 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.970
 even water and lava and so submission 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.650
 then you use sand like that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.330
 Everything could be all sorts of things 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.730
 Welten with confessed upward then grass 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.500
 Take iron, for example, is an iron 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.630
 Everything you can do then 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.330
 simply enter numbers with your ideas 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.980
 a bit complicated layers away 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.630
 is that only the sand layer finished 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.950
 is so instead of the bedrock 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.959
 finished because the stand now you have to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.640
 act a bit quick with that 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.660
 sand does not drop early 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.270
 otherwise you can not block anymore 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.470
 sit down 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.810
 So take a block was apparently out 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.660
 you see the falls hand down her 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.600
 pretty horny that is not known 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.140
 Turns off and now it's incredible 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.930
 i swear i like it this year 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.380
 The little wait until the whole stuff 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.870
 you are gone 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.459
 you go back to menu save 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.459
 to the main menu goes in again 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:43.360
 I was too early a bit this 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.459
 disturbances so you have a bit 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.590
 wait until the whole room is down 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.120
 fallen then you have to quickly into 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.900
 main menu then back in and then 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:59.850
 it should not live anymore he must now 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.850
 Wait a little bit off the road 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.829
 what am I supposed to do for as long as that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.829
 going 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.900
 Well that's a bit of a nonsense 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.889
 I hope someday to go that way 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.120
 Now hang up now 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.689
 So I only said a little bit 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.819
 but only at waltz and til otherwise so far 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.590
 his 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.349
 in the whole sand has fallen under it 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.669
 then it should be so far 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.319
 I'm waiting times still a little while 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.300
 and then I go in and still 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.099
 times outside then this should also 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.099
 sandbars have disappeared here 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:06.509
 there must be bugs and wanted others 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.509
 should have maintained a nuisance of 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.819
 So there you have to look a bit 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.129
 that is neither me nor not 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.550
 happened that there was still something left 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:30.840
 but he sees it disappears now 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.900
 everything and it is no longer so 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.979
 Strange now is always warm 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.659
 out again and in and out 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.659
 at some point it will be put forward 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:47.129
 so now I'm going one last time 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.129
 out and in again 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:52.360
 so now it does not say the world well anymore 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.589
 So it would be ready to generate it just 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.849
 a bit more because of the recording 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.849
 but otherwise it would be really small 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:02.199
 now you can build something in this world 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:13.389
 you want and there is really nothing down there 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:14.370
 that is, of course, are very kulig 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.419
 a lot actually 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.199
 Well, we just have to do a little bit 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.789
 wait and have patience just then hear 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.520
 one entirely on allowances 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.139
 you just have to look so this time 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.199
 It did not go so well now 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.509
 but once it is without problems 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.889
 you just have to stand at the beginning 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.110
 Wait a bit longer and only then 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.940
 go back in then she should 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.340
 Do not stop laying there because you do that 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:45.470
 these 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:47.510
 He is now like you are here now 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.060
 still other things can enter to 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.290
 for example because the two can be here or something 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.270
 Of course you have a lot of funny stuff 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.040
 do yes and hereby I would 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.650
 leave now and meet again 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.650
 Have fun trying out the always
