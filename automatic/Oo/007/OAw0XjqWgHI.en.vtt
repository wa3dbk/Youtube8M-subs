00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 with the voice of the people 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.460
 my mother go go boxing night 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:17.470
 first spectacular not 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.720
 andrews so without being a wonder 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.680
 without being a boxer if you lock yourself in it 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.689
 without being a boxer show he has 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.649
 won to Chavez with three things I think 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.850
 to me a good and a pretty boxing 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:41.200
 pretty tidy and pretty and pretty 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.070
 arranged and third this is a 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.079
 boxer that is better be worse it 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.760
 dedicate to boxing is not dedicated to doing 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:55.329
 other things however chávez was believed 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.489
 that was going to come and go 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.320
 and it's going to favor everything, it was not going to 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.489
 favoring the king was going to favor the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 referee was going to favor in the decision 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.840
 will favor everything we see someone who 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.170
 is what happens and it is not the fault of 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.439
 Chávez when the boxers 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.270
 they grab and protect them so very 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.200
 very much as it has been 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.610
 protected to Chávez 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.430
 gathering speakers like the one from 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 sebastián if I saw that this one that fixed him 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.960
 when he was at 160 pounds when he was 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 arranged by catching a blond poison frame 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.350
 always he was the greatest he was the one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.700
 I had the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.150
 to be in his favor but he chávez and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.619
 over with that protection that has also 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.630
 had the cinnamon has also had the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 cinnamon but above with that protection 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.830
 has distorted boxing and it has not been 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.830
 not at all professional with boxing 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:12.040
 and he's been fat and he has not dedicated himself 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.570
 boxing and already train hard and run and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.910
 do all the genetic things of a 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.340
 boxer then in this fight is 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.940
 precisely 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.560
 a result of all the above of all 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.530
 the career of what from what he has 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.680
 been chávez we have seen a chávez that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.140
 is that we go was like seeing 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.260
 I do not know roberto durán against against 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.019
 me not or it was awesome to see him and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.909
 look what it is that chávez had has 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.909
 the big balls do not have a good 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.819
 he has a lot of self-esteem and if he got 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.260
 in fonfara and I wanted to give him 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.120
 hooks in the liver not and you wanted 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.959
 put inside him he wanted to hit and 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.150
 everything but it was still protesting the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.860
 Referee kept protesting doing 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.640
 gestures and dancing outside and we watched 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.250
 that the real weight did not do anything to him 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.440
 because he could not put his chest in 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.069
 in the other's head and really 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.989
 hit him and make him bullying not what is 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.970
 let's say of Cesar Chavez and a 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.980
 force a truth that with all the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:41.110
 unbelievable merit no uncle is taller 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.720
 that he with much better with much better 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.200
 reach with a already with a 12 very very 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.420
 good with a left hook that 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.049
 threw Chávez not the truth very well 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.689
 with the whole hip getting in and even 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.900
 when when is it when it gets together 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.390
 fingers 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.760
 When Chavez cornered him, the corolla goes 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.090
 with his shoulder and hit him with the shoulder 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.810
 and I pushed him even with farah always 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.230
 it went to the air to the right and bouncing with 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.060
 a 12 and it's always always always the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.970
 right the rest of right always you 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.829
 gave chávez always do not remove is a 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.720
 boxer that chávez that is not removed either 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.759
 blows to be in boxing 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.280
 professional at these levels you have to 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.810
 know how to remove blows are removed with the 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.060
 blows with faces and looks like Antonio 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.430
 margarito all the blows are removed 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.060
 with the face does not dodge any blow 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.600
 Julio César Chávez Junior if he did not have 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.430
 the last name chávez 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.200
 this is a boxer we are talking about 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.440
 third division we are not talking about 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.960
 a boxer 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.090
 even the canelo that is also not a 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.090
 boxing superstar 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.610
 and it's worse that the canelo technically is 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.300
 worse than canelo disciplinarily 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:11.590
 obviously to me it does not have no 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.460
 have something if they have something Mexican but 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.620
 it's not the siri left that is not john 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.870
 manuel marquez we are talking about people 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.729
 that have big balls like 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:28.389
 Come on, it's an animal, it's a new 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.349
 generation of Mexican boxers that 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.510
 do not 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:37.360
 No, no, it's not the US nation 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.720
 I do not know what because he's coming for 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.170
 chávez froc croc wins him very gallant 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.080
 also for the 168 books but he wins 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.880
