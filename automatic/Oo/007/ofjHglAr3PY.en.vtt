removable<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> clean<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> gets

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
removable so you can clean it if it gets

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
removable so you can clean it if it gets
dirty<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:01.260> create<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.680> alcohol<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
dirty you can create with alcohol and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.939

whatever and go and spend my money on an
actual<00:03:45.180> airbrush<00:03:45.900> machine<00:03:46.110> yes<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
actual airbrush machine yes you have to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.850 
actual airbrush machine yes you have to
clean<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.110> can<00:03:49.260> actually<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.739> your

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
clean it but you can actually do your

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.740 
clean it but you can actually do your
eyeshadows<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.880> do<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.420> much<00:03:51.510> more<00:03:51.570> with

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
eyeshadows you can do so much more with

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.160 
eyeshadows you can do so much more with
a<00:03:51.959> professional<00:03:52.260> airbrush<00:03:52.590> machine<00:03:53.600> but<00:03:54.600> that

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
a professional airbrush machine but that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.449 
a professional airbrush machine but that
is<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.590> wanted<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.890> talk<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.280> as<00:03:56.340> well

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.520 
is what I wanted to talk to you as well
and<00:03:56.970> also<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.450> don't<00:03:57.630> like<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> fact<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.290> if

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
and also I don't like the fact that if

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.220 
and also I don't like the fact that if
you<00:03:58.650> break<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:58.950> black<00:03:59.459> thing<00:03:59.959> it's<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.140> end

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
you break this black thing it's the end

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.430 
you break this black thing it's the end
of<00:04:01.350> your<00:04:01.470> airbrush<00:04:01.680> machine<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.280> basically<00:04:02.730> if

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
of your airbrush machine so basically if

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.960 
of your airbrush machine so basically if
you're<00:04:04.440> if<00:04:04.530> you're<00:04:04.650> not<00:04:04.830> taught<00:04:05.160> properly<00:04:05.640> how

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
you're if you're not taught properly how

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.240 
you're if you're not taught properly how
to<00:04:06.000> use<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.660> machine<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.769> break<00:04:08.010> it

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
to use this machine and you break it

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.540 
to use this machine and you break it
like<00:04:08.640> I<00:04:08.760> believe<00:04:09.090> Oh

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.480 

mr.<00:04:12.730> name<00:04:12.880> ku'uipo<00:04:13.660> 1207<00:04:14.560> she<00:04:14.860> said<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.250> she

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
mr. name ku'uipo 1207 she said that she

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.580 
mr. name ku'uipo 1207 she said that she
was<00:04:15.700> sent<00:04:16.030> once<00:04:16.239> an<00:04:16.420> attempt<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.049> her

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
was sent once an attempt to and her

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.289 
was sent once an attempt to and her
things<00:04:17.860> broke<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.459> because<00:04:18.970> she<00:04:19.150> had<00:04:19.269> a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
things broke and because she had a

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.509 
things broke and because she had a
replaceable<00:04:19.750> she<00:04:20.650> could<00:04:20.830> replace<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.340> with

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
replaceable she could replace it with

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.530 
replaceable she could replace it with
something<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:21.850> Shannon<00:04:22.240> on<00:04:22.330> another

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
something that Shannon on another

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.450 
something that Shannon on another
machine<00:04:22.690> she<00:04:23.560> couldn't<00:04:23.770> shoot<00:04:24.010> her<00:04:24.100> place<00:04:24.280> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
machine she couldn't shoot her place it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.950 
machine she couldn't shoot her place it
because<00:04:24.700> 10-2<00:04:25.090> wouldn't<00:04:25.390> cover<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.690> if<00:04:25.840> you

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
because 10-2 wouldn't cover it if you

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.440 
because 10-2 wouldn't cover it if you
broke<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.320> so<00:04:27.190> what<00:04:27.670> kind<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.970> warranty<00:04:28.360> is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
broke it so what kind of warranty is

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.500 
broke it so what kind of warranty is
that<00:04:28.660> right<00:04:29.410> but<00:04:30.220> anyways<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.210> don't<00:04:31.360> put

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
that right but anyways if you don't put

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.450 
that right but anyways if you don't put
it<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.690> properly<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.770> could<00:04:33.010> break<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.430> and

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
it in properly you could break it and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.440 
it in properly you could break it and
the<00:04:33.760> fact<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:35.460> now<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.520> new<00:04:36.910> machines<00:04:37.270> you

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
the fact is now the new machines you

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.740 
the fact is now the new machines you
have<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.750> actually<00:04:37.930> click<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.620> front<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:40.690> do

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
have to actually click it front and I do

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.400 
have to actually click it front and I do
like<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.020> fact<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:42.630> an<00:04:43.630> airbrush<00:04:43.930> but

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
like the fact that it's an airbrush but

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.200 
like the fact that it's an airbrush but
look<00:04:44.560> at<00:04:44.680> how<00:04:44.770> much<00:04:44.920> a<00:04:45.130> product<00:04:45.760> that<00:04:45.940> you're

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
look at how much a product that you're

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.570 
look at how much a product that you're
that<00:04:46.690> when<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.050> airbrushing<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.770> pretty<00:04:48.430> much

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
that when you airbrushing it pretty much

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.520 
that when you airbrushing it pretty much
product<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.270> just<00:04:49.480> gets<00:04:49.840> built<00:04:50.170> up<00:04:50.320> right

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
product that just gets built up right

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.680 
product that just gets built up right
there<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:50.800> you're<00:04:50.950> supposed<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.220> clean<00:04:51.400> it

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
after it gets built up so use a lot of

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.100 
after it gets built up so use a lot of
product<00:04:55.390> right<00:04:56.040> there<00:04:57.040> money<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.210> they

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110
