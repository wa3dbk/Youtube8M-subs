00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
important graph that you will see here's

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.180 
important graph that you will see here's
where<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.640> were<00:00:47.900> and<00:00:48.900> here's<00:00:49.710> where<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.040> are

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
where we were and here's where we are

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
where we were and here's where we are
now<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.909> equates<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> sixty<00:00:52.320> percent

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
now and that equates to a sixty percent

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.240 
now and that equates to a sixty percent
reduction<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.869> size<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.530> deer<00:00:55.799> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
reduction in the size of the deer in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.910 
reduction in the size of the deer in
those<00:00:56.760> communities<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.659> sixty<00:00:58.650> percent

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
those communities a sixty percent

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.810 
those communities a sixty percent
reduction<00:01:00.650> but<00:01:01.650> you<00:01:01.830> will<00:01:01.979> continue<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.549> have

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
reduction but you will continue to have

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
reduction but you will continue to have
a<00:01:02.850> parade<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.510> skeptics<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> critics<00:01:04.769> who

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
a parade of skeptics and critics who

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
a parade of skeptics and critics who
come<00:01:05.580> through<00:01:05.610> Pittsburgh<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.750> other<00:01:06.930> places

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
come through Pittsburgh and other places

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
come through Pittsburgh and other places
and<00:01:07.590> say<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.610> reduce<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> deer<00:01:09.689> herd

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and say you can reduce the deer herd

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.550 
and say you can reduce the deer herd
with<00:01:10.200> contraception<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:12.090> folks<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.350> my

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
with contraception that folks is not my

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.520 
with contraception that folks is not my
opinion<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.939> theta<00:01:15.359> this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
opinion that's theta this is the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
opinion that's theta this is the
percentage<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> herd<00:01:17.399> that<00:01:17.579> we<00:01:17.729> treat<00:01:17.969> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
percentage of the herd that we treat it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.429 
percentage of the herd that we treat it
and<00:01:18.329> this<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.780> happened<00:01:19.079> to<00:01:19.140> fertility

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
and this is what happened to fertility

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
and this is what happened to fertility
rates<00:01:21.679> more<00:01:22.679> pictures<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.159> fertility<00:01:23.579> rates

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
rates more pictures and fertility rates

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.319 
rates more pictures and fertility rates
and<00:01:25.369> here's<00:01:26.369> what's<00:01:26.700> happening<00:01:26.789> to<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
and here's what's happening to the

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.569 
and here's what's happening to the
population<00:01:27.899> here's<00:01:28.740> where<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.100> started

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
population here's where we started

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340

here's<00:01:29.909> where<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.840> equates<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
here's where we are now that equates to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
here's where we are now that equates to
a<00:01:31.499> forty<00:01:31.920> percent<00:01:32.280> decrease<00:01:32.999> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> size<00:01:33.600> of
