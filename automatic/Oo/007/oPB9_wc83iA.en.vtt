00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.320 

these<00:00:01.620> ideas<00:00:02.070> also<00:00:02.490> allow<00:00:02.730> us<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.909> deal<00:00:03.179> with

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
these ideas also allow us to deal with

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.470 
these ideas also allow us to deal with
negative<00:00:03.810> numbers<00:00:03.840> raised<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> power<00:00:05.490> for

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
negative numbers raised to a power for

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.100 
negative numbers raised to a power for
example<00:00:06.899> if<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.170> have<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.680> negative<00:00:08.429> 5<00:00:09.110> times

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
example if we have this negative 5 times

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.209 
example if we have this negative 5 times
negative<00:00:10.260> 5

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
negative 5

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.379 
negative 5
well<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.240> equals<00:00:12.660> 25<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.730> two

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
well this equals 25 because we have two

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.349 
well this equals 25 because we have two
negative<00:00:16.020> signs<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.400> well

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
negative signs like you see there well

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.269 
negative signs like you see there well
negative<00:00:18.570> 5<00:00:18.960> times<00:00:19.350> negative<00:00:19.439> 5<00:00:19.770> could<00:00:20.250> be

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
negative 5 times negative 5 could be

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.720 
negative 5 times negative 5 could be
written<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.289> negative<00:00:22.289> 5<00:00:22.500> squared<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
written like this negative 5 squared and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.330 
written like this negative 5 squared and
this<00:00:24.630> squared<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.650> means<00:00:26.029> two<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> these

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
this squared here means two of these

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.589 
this squared here means two of these
multiplied<00:00:29.340> together<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> means<00:00:30.420> there

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
multiplied together so that means there

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
multiplied together so that means there
are<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.929> negative<00:00:31.470> signs<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
are two negative signs because that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.600 
are two negative signs because that
squared<00:00:33.270> means<00:00:33.870> two<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.200> them<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.190> negative

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
squared means two of them so negative

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
squared means two of them so negative
five<00:00:35.760> squared<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.450> 25

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
five squared is 25

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.200 
five squared is 25
well<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.059> had<00:00:39.350> negative<00:00:40.350> five<00:00:41.210> multiplied

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
well if we had negative five multiplied

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
well if we had negative five multiplied
there<00:00:42.570> three<00:00:43.200> times<00:00:48.350> here<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.770> three

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
there three times here we have three

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
there three times here we have three
negative<00:00:51.090> signs<00:00:51.570> an<00:00:51.840> odd<00:00:52.050> number<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> negative

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
negative signs an odd number of negative

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
negative signs an odd number of negative
signs<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> result<00:00:54.780> ends<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.140> being

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
signs so the result ends up being

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.720 
signs so the result ends up being
negative<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.260> 5<00:00:58.260> times<00:00:58.289> 5<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.370> 25

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
negative and this is 5 times 5 is 25

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.329 
negative and this is 5 times 5 is 25
times<00:01:00.600> 5<00:01:00.840> again<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.460> 125<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.570> negative

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
times 5 again is 125 and it's negative

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.260 
times 5 again is 125 and it's negative
negative<00:01:05.339> 125<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.010> negative<00:01:08.490> 5<00:01:08.909> times

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
negative 125 but this negative 5 times

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.990 
negative 125 but this negative 5 times
negative<00:01:09.360> 5<00:01:09.810> times<00:01:10.080> negative<00:01:10.170> 5<00:01:10.880> can<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
negative 5 times negative 5 can be

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
negative 5 times negative 5 can be
written<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.360> negative<00:01:12.840> 5<00:01:13.049> cubed<00:01:13.799> because

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
written as negative 5 cubed because

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
written as negative 5 cubed because
that's<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.880> cubed<00:01:15.360> means<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.930> means<00:01:16.110> three

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that's what cubed means that means three

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.510 
that's what cubed means that means three
of<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:17.780> multiplied<00:01:18.780> together<00:01:19.400> three<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
of these multiplied together three of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.050 
of these multiplied together three of
these<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:22.200> 3<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> exponent<00:01:23.970> means

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
these so that 3 in the exponent means

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
these so that 3 in the exponent means
three<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.140> means<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.560> are

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
three of these which means there are

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399 
three of these which means there are
three<00:01:25.759> negative<00:01:26.759> signs<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.990> makes<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
three negative signs and that makes the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.830 
three negative signs and that makes the
result<00:01:28.740> negative<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
result negative that's what we have the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.700 
result negative that's what we have the
negative<00:01:31.020> sign<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.180> negative

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
negative sign there so this is negative

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
negative sign there so this is negative
125<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.259> negative<00:01:37.740> 5<00:01:38.960> times

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
125 so if we had negative 5 times

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.490 
125 so if we had negative 5 times
negative<00:01:40.110> 5<00:01:41.329> times<00:01:42.329> negative<00:01:42.450> 5<00:01:43.049> times

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
negative 5 times negative 5 times

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
negative 5 times negative 5 times
negative<00:01:43.590> 5<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.540> equal<00:01:46.909> 625<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
negative 5 that would equal 625 and the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
negative 5 that would equal 625 and the
result<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.890> positive<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.090> we

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
result would be positive because here we

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.590 
result would be positive because here we
have<00:01:51.360> 4<00:01:51.869> negative<00:01:52.470> signs<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.250> even<00:01:53.479> number<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
have 4 negative signs and even number of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.539 
have 4 negative signs and even number of
negative<00:01:54.990> signs<00:01:55.259> which<00:01:56.009> gives<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> positive

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
negative signs which gives a positive

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.510 
negative signs which gives a positive
result<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> could<00:01:57.659> write<00:01:57.950> negative<00:01:58.950> 5<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
result so I could write negative 5 to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.190 
result so I could write negative 5 to
the<00:01:59.640> power<00:01:59.670> of<00:02:00.090> 4<00:02:00.950> equals<00:02:01.950> 625<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.509> again<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the power of 4 equals 625 and again you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
the power of 4 equals 625 and again you
look<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> exponent<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.850> odd

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
look at the exponent and see if it's odd

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.479 
look at the exponent and see if it's odd
or<00:02:06.479> even<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.500> tells<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.950> how<00:02:08.190> many<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
or even and that tells you how many of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.639 
or even and that tells you how many of
these<00:02:09.060> things<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.229> case<00:02:10.410> it's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
these things there are in this case it's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040 
these things there are in this case it's
a<00:02:10.739> negative<00:02:11.069> 5<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.180> specifically<00:02:12.810> tells

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
a negative 5 but that specifically tells

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.800 
a negative 5 but that specifically tells
you<00:02:13.170> how<00:02:13.290> many

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
you how many

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.300 
you how many
negative<00:02:14.050> signs<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.099> there<00:02:15.280> are

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
negative signs you have and if there are

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.500 
negative signs you have and if there are
an<00:02:15.610> even<00:02:16.270> number<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.620> case<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.250> an<00:02:18.550> even

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
an even number in this case for an even

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.059 
an even number in this case for an even
number<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.870> negative<00:02:20.319> signs<00:02:20.530> then<00:02:20.890> your

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
number of negative signs then your

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.880 
number of negative signs then your
result<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.550> positive<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:23.050> there<00:02:23.230> are<00:02:23.410> an<00:02:23.560> I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
result is positive and if there are an I
