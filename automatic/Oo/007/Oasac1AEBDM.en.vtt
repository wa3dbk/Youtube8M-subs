00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 and today we're going to make chocolate nougat 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.370
 and nuts for this we need 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.210
 300 grams of dark chocolate for 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.360
 melt 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.619
 300 grams of nuts that we are going to separate 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:27.050
 like 50 or 60 whole grams and the rest 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.700
 We grind 150 of butter and 150 of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.430
 sugar icing I have used sugar 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.730
 brunette because she is so much healthier 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.870
 then we start let's take the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.870
 chocolate butter 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.380
 and we are going to take it to melt 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.329
 microwave you have to be careful with the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.550
 microwave oil put it little and little 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.920
 It's the cutest thing so that we do not know 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.610
 promised to strain in principle we put 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.930
 a minister 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.930
 and then see 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.610
 and now I'm moving it no longer 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.800
 I'll put a little bit more now, I'm going to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.250
 put less time because you have to have 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.860
 very careful not to burn 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.040
 very well 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.430
 because as it is hot little by little it 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.230
 is undoing 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.230
 we are going to put half a minute more 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.109
 one with a minute and a half we have had 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.840
 we have had enough for it to be 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.840
 undo let's throw the icing sugar 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 we already mix well 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.660
 ah 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.509
 well we have mixed everything well and now 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.509
 we are going to take the mold 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.060
 these languages are great for 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 Hunt everything well 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.269
 Now let's place the nuts 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.269
 ornament 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.420
 that's how it is then now what 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.390
 We put the refrigerator so that it 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.830
 cool and solidify already and with this 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.840
 it's all finished the nougat 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.840
 we are going to cover them with a plastic 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.350
 and that county 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.609
 she at the end of types
