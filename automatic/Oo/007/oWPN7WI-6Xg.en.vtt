come with this protective strip round
and<00:00:22.769> obviously<00:00:23.100> we'll<00:00:23.430> leave<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.970> remove

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and obviously we'll leave that on remove

and obviously we'll leave that on remove
that<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> last<00:00:25.260> thing<00:00:25.650> they've<00:00:26.310> got<00:00:26.340> these

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that the last thing they've got these

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.359 
that the last thing they've got these
brackets<00:00:27.029> integrated<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> step<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
brackets integrated into the step and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.250 
brackets integrated into the step and
then<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> couple<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.570> brackets<00:00:31.019> here

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
then it's got a couple of brackets here

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.810 
then it's got a couple of brackets here
which<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.130> round<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.899> mud<00:00:34.110> flaps<00:00:34.820> these

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
which are to round the mud flaps these

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
which are to round the mud flaps these
are<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> mud<00:00:36.239> flaps<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> they're<00:00:36.960> integral

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
are the mud flaps and they're integral

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.060 
are the mud flaps and they're integral
mud<00:00:37.829> flaps<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.079> integrate<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
mud flaps so they integrate into the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.270 
mud flaps so they integrate into the
design<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.760> front<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.420> off<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> step<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
design of the front and off the step to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420 
design of the front and off the step to
make<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:44.969> look<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.750> item<00:00:46.190> okay<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
make it look like one item okay and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.860 
make it look like one item okay and
here's<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> car<00:00:48.120> we're<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
here's the car we're going to do it on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
here's the car we're going to do it on
today<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> we're<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> start<00:00:50.969> fit<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
today so we're going to start fit in the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.590 
today so we're going to start fit in the
mud<00:00:52.230> flat<00:00:52.500> bracket<00:00:52.770> okay<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.789> mud<00:00:53.969> flap<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
mud flat bracket okay so the mud flap is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
mud flat bracket okay so the mud flap is
fundamentally<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> fit<00:00:55.800> onto<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.730> car

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
fundamentally going to fit onto the car

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.900 
fundamentally going to fit onto the car
like<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.070> side<00:00:59.280> step<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
like so and the side step is going to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.150 
like so and the side step is going to
come<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.480> section<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.070> we

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.690 
four take two of these and now these are
going<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.169> be<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.680> retain<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.190> self-tapping

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
going to be to retain the self-tapping

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.260 
going to be to retain the self-tapping
screws<00:04:36.240> we<00:04:36.990> do<00:04:37.169> is<00:04:37.230> we<00:04:37.350> just<00:04:37.380> pop<00:04:37.860> these<00:04:38.270> over

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
screws we do is we just pop these over

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.800 
screws we do is we just pop these over
each<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.720> these<00:04:39.870> metal<00:04:40.230> brackets<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.980> Thurley

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
each of these metal brackets in Thurley

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.050 
each of these metal brackets in Thurley
okay<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.260> guess<00:04:43.680> also<00:04:44.580> over<00:04:45.000> there<00:04:45.210> sit<00:04:46.050> down

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
okay so I guess also over there sit down

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.480 
okay so I guess also over there sit down
and<00:04:48.060> second

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
and second

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.840 
and second
goes<00:04:49.790> in<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.060> bottom<00:04:50.479> there<00:04:51.040> okay<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.699> they

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
goes in the bottom there okay so they

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.700 
goes in the bottom there okay so they
will<00:04:53.120> they'll<00:04:53.660> form<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.199> mounts<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:54.650> the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
will they'll form the mounts for the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.560 
will they'll form the mounts for the
screws<00:04:55.070> later<00:04:55.370> okay<00:04:57.520> okay<00:04:58.520> when<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.210> mud<00:04:59.360> flap

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
screws later okay okay when the mud flap

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.710 
screws later okay okay when the mud flap
goes<00:04:59.810> on<00:05:00.080> it's<00:05:00.320> actually<00:05:00.470> bolted<00:05:01.100> on<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.520> this

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
goes on it's actually bolted on to this

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.749 
goes on it's actually bolted on to this
wing<00:05:02.720> panel<00:05:03.139> here<00:05:03.320> with<00:05:03.470> two<00:05:03.710> bolts<00:05:04.100> one<00:05:04.340> hand

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
wing panel here with two bolts one hand

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.719 
wing panel here with two bolts one hand
on<00:05:05.419> here<00:05:05.810> now<00:05:06.320> if<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.620> line<00:05:06.830> these<00:05:07.100> two<00:05:07.400> up<00:05:07.550> you

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
on here now if you line these two up you

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.909 
on here now if you line these two up you
can<00:05:07.940> see<00:05:08.270> where<00:05:09.020> you've<00:05:09.139> got<00:05:09.350> this<00:05:09.470> change<00:05:09.800> of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
can see where you've got this change of

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.460 
can see where you've got this change of
curvature<00:05:10.610> here<00:05:10.870> aligns<00:05:11.870> with<00:05:12.110> where<00:05:12.320> you've

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
curvature here aligns with where you've

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.590 
curvature here aligns with where you've
got<00:05:12.620> this<00:05:12.770> change<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.280> curvature<00:05:13.880> here<00:05:14.060> so

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
got this change of curvature here so

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.540 
got this change of curvature here so
when<00:05:14.720> you<00:05:14.810> put<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:15.080> on<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.320> panel<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.400> look

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
when you put it on the panel if you look

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.150 
when you put it on the panel if you look
at<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.729> gap<00:05:16.910> there<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.330> can<00:05:17.539> see<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.530> comes<00:05:18.860> in

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
at the gap there you can see it comes in

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.029 
at the gap there you can see it comes in
to<00:05:19.850> location<00:05:20.509> then<00:05:20.750> then<00:05:21.470> you've<00:05:21.620> got<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.830> in

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
to location then then you've got it in

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.090 
to location then then you've got it in
location<00:05:22.789> what<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.539> can<00:05:23.720> do<00:05:23.960> is<00:05:24.800> with<00:05:25.070> a

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
location what you can do is with a

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.930 
location what you can do is with a
marker<00:05:25.610> pen<00:05:25.990> okay<00:05:26.990> mark<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:28.520> can<00:05:28.669> see<00:05:28.820> there

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
marker pen okay mark you can see there

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.060 
marker pen okay mark you can see there
okay<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:33.139> then<00:05:33.260> we've<00:05:33.380> got<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.620> do<00:05:33.710> is<00:05:33.830> drill

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
okay and then we've got to do is drill

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
the hole now this one here had the

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.140 
the hole now this one here had the
old-style<00:05:36.110> mud<00:05:36.500> flaps<00:05:36.800> already<00:05:37.220> fitted<00:05:37.880> on

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
old-style mud flaps already fitted on

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.610 
old-style mud flaps already fitted on
this<00:05:38.330> car<00:05:38.630> okay

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
this car okay

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.010 
this car okay
so<00:05:39.889> with<00:05:39.979> a<00:05:40.010> seven<00:05:40.400> millimeter<00:05:40.580> drill<00:05:41.240> okay

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
so with a seven millimeter drill okay

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:50.260 
so with a seven millimeter drill okay
carefully<00:05:42.880> drill<00:05:47.259> okay<00:05:48.259> so<00:05:49.130> do<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.759> then

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
carefully drill okay so do that and then

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.270 
carefully drill okay so do that and then
do<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.539> same<00:05:50.780> for<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.139> top<00:05:51.349> one<00:05:51.620> here<00:05:51.979> and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
do the same for the top one here and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.909 
do the same for the top one here and
then<00:05:52.820> we<00:05:52.940> we've<00:05:53.599> got<00:05:53.780> those<00:05:53.960> pre-drilled<00:05:54.680> for

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
then we we've got those pre-drilled for

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.820 
then we we've got those pre-drilled for
later<00:05:55.130> okay<00:05:55.990> with<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.199> done<00:05:57.530> when<00:05:57.740> you've

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
later okay with that done when you've

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.370 
later okay with that done when you've
done<00:05:57.979> both<00:05:58.190> those<00:05:58.490> holes<00:05:58.820> okay<00:05:59.810> all<00:06:00.169> you<00:06:00.260> got

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
done both those holes okay all you got

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.469 
done both those holes okay all you got
to<00:06:00.470> do<00:06:00.560> is<00:06:00.650> put<00:06:00.860> this<00:06:00.949> panel<00:06:01.250> back<00:06:01.520> on<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:02.330> what

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
to do is put this panel back on so what

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.610 
to do is put this panel back on so what
you're<00:06:02.599> looking<00:06:02.870> at<00:06:02.960> is<00:06:03.080> where<00:06:03.260> this<00:06:03.440> little

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
you're looking at is where this little

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.310 
you're looking at is where this little
tab<00:06:04.039> aligns<00:06:04.430> here<00:06:04.970> in<00:06:05.150> there<00:06:06.050> there's<00:06:06.260> a

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
tab aligns here in there there's a

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.170 
tab aligns here in there there's a
little<00:06:06.440> square<00:06:06.770> docking<00:06:07.310> hole<00:06:07.520> and<00:06:08.090> then

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
little square docking hole and then

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.120 
little square docking hole and then
obviously<00:06:08.330> these<00:06:08.599> two<00:06:08.840> clips<00:06:09.229> here<00:06:09.500> with

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
obviously these two clips here with

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.640 
obviously these two clips here with
these<00:06:10.280> springy<00:06:10.669> bits<00:06:11.000> go<00:06:11.720> into<00:06:12.050> these<00:06:12.229> two

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
these springy bits go into these two

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.300 
these springy bits go into these two
here<00:06:12.949> so<00:06:13.220> align<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.210> top<00:06:14.449> first

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.160 

then<00:06:18.310> they<00:06:18.430> should<00:06:18.760> push<00:06:19.600> you<00:06:19.750> up<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:19.930> bolt

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
then they should push you up the bolt

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
then they should push you up the bolt
they're<00:06:20.380> too<00:06:20.590> tight

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
they're too tight

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.390 
they're too tight
and<00:06:21.760> then<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:22.000> bottom<00:06:22.290> just<00:06:23.290> clips<00:06:23.590> in<00:06:23.830> okay

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
and then the bottom just clips in okay

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.030 
and then the bottom just clips in okay
so<00:06:24.940> now<00:06:25.150> we'll<00:06:25.330> start<00:06:25.540> -<00:06:26.080> okay<00:06:26.290> so<00:06:26.350> this<00:06:26.620> is<00:06:26.860> the

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
so now we'll start - okay so this is the

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.600 
so now we'll start - okay so this is the
step

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
step

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.000 
step
it's<00:06:27.880> obviously<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.570> end<00:06:28.870> here<00:06:29.200> that<00:06:29.230> this

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
it's obviously this end here that this

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.610 
it's obviously this end here that this
just<00:06:30.220> got<00:06:30.370> there<00:06:30.610> the<00:06:31.120> unfinished<00:06:31.570> end<00:06:32.020> goes

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
just got there the unfinished end goes

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.620 
just got there the unfinished end goes
to<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.920> front<00:06:33.190> of<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.490> car<00:06:33.760> the<00:06:34.270> edge<00:06:34.390> with

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
to the front of the car the edge with

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.080 
to the front of the car the edge with
the<00:06:34.720> curve<00:06:34.930> goes<00:06:35.290> to<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:35.650> rear<00:06:35.830> and<00:06:36.340> basically

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
the curve goes to the rear and basically

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.690 
the curve goes to the rear and basically
how<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:37.480> fits<00:06:37.780> is<00:06:38.080> that<00:06:38.290> two<00:06:38.800> bolts<00:06:39.190> go<00:06:39.430> through

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
how it fits is that two bolts go through

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.120 
how it fits is that two bolts go through
these<00:06:39.850> two<00:06:40.180> holes<00:06:40.420> here<00:06:40.810> on<00:06:41.290> these<00:06:41.560> two<00:06:41.890> holes

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
these two holes here on these two holes

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.300 
these two holes here on these two holes
here<00:06:42.490> and<00:06:42.760> it<00:06:43.270> hangs<00:06:43.630> off<00:06:43.990> oh<00:06:44.260> please<00:06:44.680> -<00:06:45.100> and

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
here and it hangs off oh please - and

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.850 
here and it hangs off oh please - and
then<00:06:45.820> there's<00:06:45.970> two<00:06:46.240> m8<00:06:47.020> bolts<00:06:47.440> that<00:06:47.560> go<00:06:47.620> up

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
then there's two m8 bolts that go up
