had to use equipment that was here on
board<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.369> space<00:00:19.609> station<00:00:19.999> we<00:00:20.659> may<00:00:20.839> have<00:00:20.990> the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
board the space station we may have the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.169 
board the space station we may have the
coolest<00:00:21.529> wash<00:00:21.769> clods<00:00:22.159> ever<00:00:22.460> here<00:00:22.970> on<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
coolest wash clods ever here on the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.479 
coolest wash clods ever here on the
space<00:00:23.419> station<00:00:23.449> I'm<00:00:23.900> going<00:00:24.019> to<00:00:24.109> show<00:00:24.230> you

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:24.489 
space station I'm going to show you

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:31.210 
space station I'm going to show you
here's<00:00:25.489> one<00:00:25.669> of<00:00:25.789> our<00:00:25.880> washcloths<00:00:30.009> and<00:00:31.009> it's

tiny<00:00:34.220> hockey<00:00:34.760> puck<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:35.870> that<00:00:36.080> it<00:00:36.410> saves<00:00:36.770> space

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
tiny hockey puck so that it saves space

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.180 
tiny hockey puck so that it saves space
but<00:00:38.000> when<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:38.210> open<00:00:38.450> up<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.630> hockey<00:00:38.810> puck

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
and you pull out your washcloth this is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.220 
and you pull out your washcloth this is
the<00:00:46.700> one<00:00:46.820> I'm<00:00:46.940> gonna<00:00:47.000> use<00:00:47.120> for<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.630> experiment

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
the one I'm gonna use for the experiment

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.080 
the one I'm gonna use for the experiment
today<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.430> when<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:52.670> open<00:00:52.700> up<00:00:53.030> your

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
today and so when you open up your

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
hockey puck and turn it into a washcloth

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.170 
hockey puck and turn it into a washcloth
it<00:00:56.870> was<00:00:57.050> compressed<00:00:57.500> hit<00:00:58.490> a<00:00:58.520> great<00:00:58.700> big<00:00:58.940> vise

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
it was compressed hit a great big vise

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.460 
it was compressed hit a great big vise
somewhere<00:00:59.980> okay<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.040> here's<00:01:01.340> my<00:01:01.400> washcloth

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
somewhere okay so here's my washcloth

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.320 
somewhere okay so here's my washcloth
like<00:01:03.470> a<00:01:03.500> magic<00:01:03.890> trick<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.729> now<00:01:04.939> I'm<00:01:05.030> gonna<00:01:05.180> get

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
like a magic trick and now I'm gonna get

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.780 
like a magic trick and now I'm gonna get
this<00:01:05.650> soaking<00:01:06.650> wet<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.040> then<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:07.700> gonna

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
this soaking wet and then we're gonna

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.820 
this soaking wet and then we're gonna
see<00:01:08.060> what'll<00:01:08.360> happen<00:01:08.510> when<00:01:08.750> we<00:01:08.840> wring<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.110> out

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.070 

Meriden<00:01:12.830> kendra<00:01:13.340> suggested<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.150> i<00:01:14.210> dip<00:01:14.900> this

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
Meriden kendra suggested that i dip this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.500 
Meriden kendra suggested that i dip this
in<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.350> bag<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:15.860> bags<00:01:16.520> don't<00:01:16.820> hold<00:01:17.030> water<00:01:17.240> in

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
in a bag but bags don't hold water in

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.899 
in a bag but bags don't hold water in
space<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.020> instead<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.590> filled<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.370> water<00:01:19.610> bag

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
space so instead I filled a water bag

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.580 
space so instead I filled a water bag
this<00:01:20.180> says<00:01:20.390> drinking<00:01:21.260> water<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:23.590> I'm

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
this says drinking water in it and I'm

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.190 
this says drinking water in it and I'm
going<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.920> squirt<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.909> bunch<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.210> water<00:01:26.450> into

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
going to squirt a bunch of water into

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:45.870 
going to squirt a bunch of water into
this<00:01:27.350> washcloth

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.020 

it's<00:02:15.239> coming<00:02:16.109> up<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.469> the<00:02:16.739> water<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:20.609> water<00:02:20.819> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it's coming up to the water the water is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's coming up to the water the water is
all<00:02:21.180> over<00:02:21.329> my<00:02:21.540> hands<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.079> fact<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.409> rings<00:02:22.680> out

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
all over my hands in fact it rings out

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
all over my hands in fact it rings out
of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.129> cloth<00:02:23.370> into<00:02:23.640> my<00:02:23.790> hands<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.719> let

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
of the cloth into my hands and if I let

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.140 
of the cloth into my hands and if I let
go<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.349> cloth<00:02:25.590> carefully

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.270 

the<00:02:29.540> water<00:02:29.810> sort<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.319> has<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.680> sticked<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.250> my

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the water sort of has it sticked to my

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.140 
the water sort of has it sticked to my
hand<00:02:32.709> okay<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.099> experiment<00:02:34.970> worked

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
hand okay so the experiment worked

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.850 
hand okay so the experiment worked
beautifully<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.379> answer<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.769> the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
beautifully and the answer to the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.369 
beautifully and the answer to the
question<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.940> water<00:02:38.209> squeezes<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.140> of

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
question is the water squeezes out of

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.979 
question is the water squeezes out of
the<00:02:39.500> cloth<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.330> then<00:02:41.330> because<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the cloth and then because of the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.369 
the cloth and then because of the
surface<00:02:42.349> tension<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.129> water<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:44.379> it

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
surface tension of the water it it

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.619 
surface tension of the water it it
actually<00:02:45.560> runs<00:02:46.010> along<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.940> surface<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
actually runs along the surface of the

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.229 
actually runs along the surface of the
cloth<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.170> then<00:02:48.560> up<00:02:48.680> into<00:02:48.890> my<00:02:49.069> hand<00:02:49.400> almost

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
cloth and then up into my hand almost

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.110 
cloth and then up into my hand almost
like<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.780> had<00:02:51.010> jello<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.129> your<00:02:52.400> hands<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:52.849> gel

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
like you had jello on your hands or gel

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.210 
like you had jello on your hands or gel
on<00:02:53.269> your<00:02:53.360> hand<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.200> it'll<00:02:54.379> just<00:02:54.590> stay<00:02:54.799> there

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
on your hand and it'll just stay there

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.699
