00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.770 
looking for at least i would say i
didn't<00:01:41.000> i<00:01:41.240> was<00:01:42.670> skeptical<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:43.850> would<00:01:44.450> go

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
didn't i was skeptical that it would go

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.450 
didn't i was skeptical that it would go
as<00:01:44.900> smoothly<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.560> has<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:46.040> at<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.220> same

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
as smoothly as it has but at the same

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.270 
as smoothly as it has but at the same
time<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:48.320> know<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.440> think<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.950> was<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.100> whole

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
time you know I think that was the whole

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.460 
time you know I think that was the whole
reason<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.820> bury<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:50.810> was<00:01:50.930> just<00:01:51.170> to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
reason to bury that it was just to

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.860 
reason to bury that it was just to
smooth<00:01:51.770> things<00:01:51.950> out<00:01:52.130> once<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.550> for<00:01:52.610> all<00:01:52.760> and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
smooth things out once and for all and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.900 
smooth things out once and for all and
we<00:01:53.870> both<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.260> lived<00:01:54.500> up<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:55.070> really

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
we both have lived up to that I really

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.490 
we both have lived up to that I really
liked<00:01:56.090> as<00:01:56.240> well<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.810> documentary<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
liked as well but the documentary the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.140 
liked as well but the documentary the
fact<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.860> they<00:01:58.280> kind<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.550> reiterated<00:01:59.060> that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
fact that they kind of reiterated that

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.880 
fact that they kind of reiterated that
Montreal<00:01:59.930> is<00:01:59.960> not<00:02:00.260> what<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.470> two<00:02:00.680> are<00:02:00.710> going

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
Montreal is not what you two are going

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.650 
Montreal is not what you two are going
to<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.040> simply<00:02:01.790> remembered<00:02:02.180> for<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.480> one

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
to be simply remembered for that one

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.510 
to be simply remembered for that one
night<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:03.020> think<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.320> project<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.100> think

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
night and I think this project I think

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.010 
night and I think this project I think
it's<00:02:04.610> finally<00:02:04.970> going<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.180> put<00:02:05.300> Montreal<00:02:05.810> to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's finally going to put Montreal to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.440 
it's finally going to put Montreal to
rest<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.190> is<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.640> period<00:02:08.330> of

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
rest and that this is this period of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.600 
rest and that this is this period of
your<00:02:08.600> lives<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.320> something<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:09.920> both<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.399> you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
your lives is something that both of you

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.250 
your lives is something that both of you
have<00:02:10.640> fast<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.360> think<00:02:11.570> for<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:11.990> better

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
mean that's a whole life that you you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.469 
mean that's a whole life that you you
know<00:05:04.889> once<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.370> become<00:05:05.639> one<00:05:05.850> at<00:05:06.000> sweet<00:05:06.240> job

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.060 
know once you become one at sweet job
with<00:05:06.660> your<00:05:06.780> lineup<00:05:06.960> then<00:05:07.380> they<00:05:07.680> take<00:05:07.889> that

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
with your lineup then they take that

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.340 
with your lineup then they take that
away<00:05:08.160> from<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:08.820> cool<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.690> probably<00:05:10.080> the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
away from you this cool it probably the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.480 
away from you this cool it probably the
biggest<00:05:10.560> reason<00:05:10.770> why<00:05:11.010> there's<00:05:11.190> some<00:05:11.310> of<00:05:11.400> these

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
biggest reason why there's some of these

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.120 
biggest reason why there's some of these
wrestlers<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.000> are<00:05:12.210> dying<00:05:12.389> innocent<00:05:13.139> they

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
wrestlers that are dying innocent they

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.590 
wrestlers that are dying innocent they
can't<00:05:14.370> get<00:05:14.550> over<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:14.790> part<00:05:15.180> of<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.360> when<00:05:15.510> they

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
can't get over that part of it when they

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.870 
can't get over that part of it when they
lose<00:05:15.750> their<00:05:16.020> job<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:17.190> wrestling<00:05:17.580> becomes

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
lose their job and the wrestling becomes

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.510 
lose their job and the wrestling becomes
a<00:05:18.000> faded<00:05:18.360> memory<00:05:18.590> but<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:19.800> Harry's<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.310> young

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
a faded memory but for Harry's a young

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.850 
a faded memory but for Harry's a young

that direction he's very passionate
about<00:05:31.110> MMA<00:05:31.710> probably<00:05:32.220> more<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:32.580> than<00:05:32.789> Pro

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
about MMA probably more so than Pro

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.850 
about MMA probably more so than Pro
Wrestling<00:05:33.270> more<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:33.990> than<00:05:34.200> amateur<00:05:34.650> wrestling

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
Wrestling more so than amateur wrestling

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.380 
Wrestling more so than amateur wrestling
and<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.220> lot<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.370> things<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.789> he's<00:05:35.940> very<00:05:36.180> good

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390

back<00:05:42.930> on<00:05:42.960> track<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:43.710> think<00:05:43.919> Harry<00:05:44.130> maybe<00:05:44.430> from<00:05:45.180> a

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
back on track I think Harry maybe from a

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.450 
back on track I think Harry maybe from a
WWE<00:05:45.840> perspective<00:05:46.470> maybe<00:05:46.650> just<00:05:46.950> maybe<00:05:47.070> needed

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
WWE perspective maybe just maybe needed

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.920 
WWE perspective maybe just maybe needed

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
to kind of take some time off and

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.680 
to kind of take some time off and
regroup<00:05:49.289> and<00:05:50.000> reinvent<00:05:51.000> himself<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.570> come

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
regroup and reinvent himself and come

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.570 
regroup and reinvent himself and come
back<00:05:51.840> as

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580
