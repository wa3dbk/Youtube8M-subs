00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.510
 yes 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello youtube people are welcome to 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.940
 a new video creepy pasta in this case 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.550
 del gta san andreas I hope it's your 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.000
 I like this good video with nothing more than 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 say let's start was 10 years old and played 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 al gta san andreas on my ps2 it was all 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 Normal had the game completed 100% 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.550
 all acrobatic jumps all 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.520
 basically conquered territories 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.010
 everything that could be done one day 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.190
 happened to go to the jeferson motel place where 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.590
 run the mission reuniting families 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.900
 upon entering I saw everything weird was totally 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 empty there was no one in the rooms 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.090
 or in the corridors when arriving at a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.010
 crossed there was a broken skylight and I remembered 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 the entrance of the swat in the mission 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.080
 before mentioned then my curiosity 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.110
 it led me to think that there is beyond 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.900
 that skylight activates the jumping trick 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.900
 high after several attempts I managed 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.720
 go up when looking with the camera I saw an icon 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.750
 I did not care about it and jumped 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.780
 vacuum with the parachute 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.420
 it was the worst mistake of my life I was a 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.640
 long time falling approximately 5 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.500
 minutes until I thought about restarting the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
 console because I thought the game was 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 I had stuck but curiosity 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 invited to keep looking finally 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.619
 I got to see a part of ' the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.290
 saints but it was strange the sky was 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.950
 of a reddish color there was no one in the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.050
 streets or cars or anything activate the trick 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.660
 of the jet paq and I started to explore the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.700
 place said place was a piece of map 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.670
 since it had limits in which 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.070
 fell to the void the windows were 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.640
 transparent and the interior of the houses 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.800
 there was also nothing when going to an extreme 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.080
 from the map I came across a house with 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.899
 a transparent window but inside I saw 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.030
 something hanging what I did not know was that 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.940
 that something would chase me in my 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.250
 nightmares all my life you 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.140
 I fired with almost all the weapons until 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.869
 I took pictures of him and those things 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.080
 They balanced and moved when they pulled 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.600
 an explosive I lost control of cj 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 cj released a heartbreaking scream so 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.340
 realistic that made my hair stand on end 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.220
 he started doing a strange animation 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.890
 who had never seen how to cry 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.540
 cries and crying did not stop were like 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.020
 those that were heard when falling without 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 parachute or when I was burning I was 5 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.730
 minutes waiting for something to happen 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.760
 screaming and crying did not stop until 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.770
 they finally stopped and cj started running 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.730
 to vacuum while the camera was 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.220
 static cj was lost in the distance not 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.530
 I could pause and touch some button 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.200
 it had an effect so I proceeded to 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.930
 restart the console the game does not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.150
 he started the only thing he said was gta san 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.240
 andreas criticizes the error in a window 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.610
 with an x ​​icon when removing the disk vi 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.410
 that was completely scratched as if 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.510
 someone would have passed him a role of 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.510
 sandpaper from behind it was obvious that I was not going to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.910
 work never went back into that 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.030
 hotel nor when I buy another gta record 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.580
 san andreas for ps2 neither for pc nor for 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.580
 ps3 I did not tell anyone about this
