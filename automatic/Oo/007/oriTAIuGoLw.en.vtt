00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
one drawn out story one drawn out

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
one drawn out story one drawn out
narrative<00:01:16.549> sometimes<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.610> try<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.030> start

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
narrative sometimes I try to like start

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
narrative sometimes I try to like start
slipping<00:01:18.659> politics<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> felt

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
slipping politics into it but I felt

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
slipping politics into it but I felt
like<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> story<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.729> wasn't<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.930> wasn't

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like the story just wasn't it wasn't

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
like the story just wasn't it wasn't
calling<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> wanted

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
calling for that in a way and I wanted

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
calling for that in a way and I wanted
to<00:01:23.820> let<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> story<00:01:24.299> sort<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> breathe<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.830> its

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to let the story sort of breathe on its

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.340 
to let the story sort of breathe on its
own<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:27.090> politics<00:01:27.600> sometimes<00:01:27.900> move<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
own I think politics sometimes move so

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.830 
own I think politics sometimes move so
fast<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.009> you're<00:01:29.130> doing<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> long

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
fast that if you're doing like a long

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.929 
fast that if you're doing like a long
story<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
story on it

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.469 
story on it
you're<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.090> left<00:01:33.329> behind<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.810> quickly<00:01:35.479> that

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you're like left behind so quickly that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.429 
you're like left behind so quickly that
it's<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:37.170> necessarily<00:01:37.829> relevant<00:01:39.079> anyway<00:01:40.079> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it's not necessarily relevant anyway so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
it's not necessarily relevant anyway so
like<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.740> you're<00:01:40.860> gonna<00:01:40.950> cover<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.880> current

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like if you're gonna cover in current

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.490 
like if you're gonna cover in current
events<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.140> fast

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
events you kind of have to do fast

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
events you kind of have to do fast
things<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:45.149> you're<00:01:45.240> gonna<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
things and if you're gonna do like a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
things and if you're gonna do like a
long<00:01:46.110> drawn-out<00:01:46.579> story<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.119> well

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
long drawn-out story you might as well

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.530 
long drawn-out story you might as well
just<00:01:48.390> sort<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> tangent<00:01:49.259> because

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
just sort of go off on a tangent because

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
just sort of go off on a tangent because
it's<00:01:51.540> gonna<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> be

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it's gonna be it's not going to be

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
it's gonna be it's not going to be
relevant<00:01:53.930> one<00:01:54.930> rightie<00:01:55.140> other<00:01:55.350> anyway
