they're<00:04:45.399> actually<00:04:45.669> quite<00:04:45.819> decent<00:04:46.389> where<00:04:46.599> they

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
they're actually quite decent where they

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:47.909 
they're actually quite decent where they
design<00:04:47.019> them<00:04:47.229> so<00:04:47.259> you<00:04:47.439> progress<00:04:47.709> through

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
design them so you progress through

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.889 
design them so you progress through
properly<00:04:48.550> instead<00:04:49.269> of<00:04:49.389> just<00:04:49.509> running<00:04:49.659> in

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
until you find the next key but you

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.540 
until you find the next key but you

underlying factor here is that it's just
not<00:04:58.539> very<00:04:58.689> fun<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.169> play<00:05:00.209> there's<00:05:01.209> an<00:05:01.330> enemy

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
not very fun to play there's an enemy

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.850 
not very fun to play there's an enemy
you<00:05:01.659> encounter<00:05:01.689> later<00:05:02.169> on<00:05:02.379> that<00:05:02.499> walks<00:05:02.679> around

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
you encounter later on that walks around

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.889 
you encounter later on that walks around
throwing<00:05:03.099> its<00:05:03.279> feces<00:05:03.699> at<00:05:03.879> you<00:05:04.029> it's<00:05:04.599> not<00:05:04.719> there

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:04.899 
throwing its feces at you it's not there

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:06.329 
throwing its feces at you it's not there
throughout<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.289> entire<00:05:05.559> story<00:05:05.889> but<00:05:06.099> it<00:05:06.189> does

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:06.339 
throughout the entire story but it does

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.219 
throughout the entire story but it does
come<00:05:06.519> up<00:05:06.639> quite<00:05:06.879> frequently<00:05:07.089> and<00:05:07.659> I<00:05:08.050> think

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
come up quite frequently and I think

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.419 
come up quite frequently and I think
that's<00:05:08.379> a<00:05:08.439> good<00:05:08.589> metaphor<00:05:08.769> for<00:05:09.159> redneck

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:09.429 
that's a good metaphor for redneck

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:11.369 
that's a good metaphor for redneck
