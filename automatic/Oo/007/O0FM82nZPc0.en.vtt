and you think about this but it would

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.310 
and you think about this but it would
see<00:04:21.180> some<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:22.019> know<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.380> lot<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.800> stuff<00:04:23.160> that

rouse guys not playing it one hundred

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.210 
rouse guys not playing it one hundred
percent<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:30.360> think<00:04:30.870> our<00:04:30.990> effort<00:04:31.290> was<00:04:31.470> not<00:04:31.680> as

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
percent I think our effort was not as

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.860 
percent I think our effort was not as
much<00:04:32.460> as<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.760> wanted<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.060> see<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.450> some<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.810> those

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
much as I wanted to see it some of those

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.860 
much as I wanted to see it some of those
games<00:04:34.340> and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
games and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.750 
games and
I<00:04:35.930> think<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.440> was<00:04:36.470> looking<00:04:36.980> forward<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.370> class

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
I think it was looking forward to class

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.130 
I think it was looking forward to class
knowing<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.450> you<00:04:38.600> know<00:04:38.660> there<00:04:38.840> was<00:04:38.930> a

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
knowing that you know there was a

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.920 
knowing that you know there was a
challenge<00:04:39.890> for<00:04:40.790> first<00:04:41.030> place<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.600> we've<00:04:41.720> lost

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
challenge for first place and we've lost

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.230 
challenge for first place and we've lost
position<00:04:42.530> with<00:04:42.680> Cleveland<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:43.940> those<00:04:44.090> are

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
position with Cleveland so those are

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.820 
position with Cleveland so those are
some<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.600> things<00:04:44.690> i<00:04:45.050> can<00:04:45.260> add<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> missile
