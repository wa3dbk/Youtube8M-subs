and poster that I tried and failed the
tear<00:00:56.760> down<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> get

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
tear down and then you just want to get

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:16.030

up<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.519> rooftop<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:06.000> much

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.990 

ideally<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.550> on<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> rooftop

ideally you want to get up on a rooftop

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.740 
ideally you want to get up on a rooftop
so<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.840> jump<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.880> hay<00:01:20.880> bale<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:21.510> then

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so you can jump into a hay bale and then

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.250 
so you can jump into a hay bale and then
use<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:26.270> lose<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> guards<00:01:27.810> who<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:27.930> chasing

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.440 
use the lose the guards who are chasing
you<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.890> thought<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.300> like<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you I thought maybe there was like a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.000 
you I thought maybe there was like a
third<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.080> poster<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> turned<00:01:31.860> out

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
third one in poster but it turned out

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.640 
third one in poster but it turned out
that<00:01:32.160> was<00:01:32.280> actually<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.640> seeing<00:01:33.060> Adams

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
difficult especially considering that it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.350 
difficult especially considering that it
makes<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.370> have<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.550> run<00:02:42.790> away<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.300> you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
makes it so you have to run away and you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.210 
makes it so you have to run away and you
have<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> slow<00:02:43.989> escort<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.800> these<00:02:44.920> are<00:02:45.040> likely

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
have a slow escort so these are likely

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.240 
have a slow escort so these are likely
and<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.489> know<00:02:45.700> my<00:02:45.940> supplies<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> meet<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.840> there

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and I know my supplies I meet you there

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
and I know my supplies I meet you there
so<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.310> got<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.519> work<00:02:48.670> your<00:02:48.820> way<00:02:48.970> around

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so you got to work your way around

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.100 
so you got to work your way around
avoiding<00:02:50.530> these<00:02:50.650> checkpoints<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
avoiding these checkpoints and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.680 
avoiding these checkpoints and
periodically<00:02:54.010> slowing<00:02:54.519> down<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:55.060> let<00:02:55.299> Sam

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
periodically slowing down to let Sam

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.820 
periodically slowing down to let Sam
Adams<00:02:56.110> catch<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:56.830> you

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:21.780 

because<00:03:04.830> he<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.130> slow

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.369 

so<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.060> make<00:03:23.360> your<00:03:23.510> way<00:03:23.569> down<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.230> this

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
so you just make your way down to this

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:34.570 
so you just make your way down to this
alley<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:31.700> climb<00:03:32.150> over<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:33.580> building

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
alley and then climb over the building

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.979 
alley and then climb over the building
here<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.030> then<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.269> just<00:03:35.420> got<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.629> drop<00:03:35.840> down

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
here and then you just got to drop down

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.930 
here and then you just got to drop down
on<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> other<00:03:36.409> side<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.010> Sam<00:03:37.340> Adams<00:03:37.700> will

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
on the other side and Sam Adams will

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.729 
on the other side and Sam Adams will
follow<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.390> apparently<00:03:38.750> he<00:03:39.049> was<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.200> Brewer<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
follow you apparently he was a Brewer a

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.420 
follow you apparently he was a Brewer a
patriot<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.640> parkour<00:03:41.090> enthusiast<00:03:45.430> and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
patriot and a parkour enthusiast and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.390 
patriot and a parkour enthusiast and
that's<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.909> end<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.120> Boston's<00:03:47.480> most<00:03:47.720> wanted

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's the end of Boston's most wanted

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.150 
that's the end of Boston's most wanted
so<00:03:49.400> that's<00:03:49.670> pretty<00:03:50.030> easy
