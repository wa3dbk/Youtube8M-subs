00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
originally the blue-eyed flash deck it

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.310 
originally the blue-eyed flash deck it
was<00:01:58.330> very<00:01:58.390> good<00:01:58.690> when<00:01:58.840> people<00:01:58.870> were<00:01:59.200> playing

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
was very good when people were playing

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.130 
was very good when people were playing
camera<00:01:59.620> souls<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:01.420> everyone<00:02:01.900> started

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
camera souls when everyone started

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.420 
camera souls when everyone started
playing<00:02:02.350> cavern<00:02:02.620> of<00:02:02.680> souls<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.100> basically

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
playing cavern of souls and basically

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.460 
playing cavern of souls and basically
everyday<00:02:03.960> counterspells<00:02:04.960> became<00:02:05.230> much<00:02:05.440> worse

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
everyday counterspells became much worse

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.430 
everyday counterspells became much worse
and<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.760> had<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.030> adapt<00:02:07.360> by<00:02:07.840> playing<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.290> lot

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and so we had to adapt by playing a lot

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.430 
and so we had to adapt by playing a lot
of<00:02:08.530> smart<00:02:08.740> move<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.540> Jerry<00:02:10.540> brewed<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.869> the

the fact that it costs to is a little

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.900 
the fact that it costs to is a little
bad<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:13.530> that's<00:06:13.890> why<00:06:14.100> we're<00:06:14.340> not<00:06:14.370> playing<00:06:14.760> it

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910

the snapcaster mage being able to flash

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.090 
the snapcaster mage being able to flash
