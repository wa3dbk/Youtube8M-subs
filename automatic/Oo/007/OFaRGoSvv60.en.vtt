to talk about the the the option you
have<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.400> well<00:00:17.400> we've<00:00:17.789> seen<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> option<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
have of well we've seen the option of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.090 
have of well we've seen the option of
creating<00:00:19.109> herbs

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
creating herbs

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.300 
creating herbs
we've<00:00:20.550> seen<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> option<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.210> create<00:00:22.310> cut-up

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we've seen the option to create cut-up

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.779 
we've seen the option to create cut-up
drawings<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.660> rig<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.789> plain

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
drawings and and rig them up plain

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.300 
drawings and and rig them up plain
drawings<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.470> I'll<00:00:28.619> introduce<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
drawings but now I'll introduce you to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.880 
drawings but now I'll introduce you to
the<00:00:29.789> method<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.179> symbols<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.900> gives<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the method of symbols which gives you a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
the method of symbols which gives you a
little<00:00:31.980> bit<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.279> versatility<00:00:32.809> when<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
little bit more versatility when it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
little bit more versatility when it
comes<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.620> drawing<00:00:35.489> substitution<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
comes to drawing substitution and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.900 
comes to drawing substitution and
reusing<00:00:37.290> elements<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.860> things<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.190> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
reusing elements and things like that so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.959 
reusing elements and things like that so
I'll<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.750> by<00:00:41.750> doing<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.399> rough<00:00:44.399> drawing<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
I'll start by doing a rough drawing of

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.569 
I'll start by doing a rough drawing of
an<00:00:45.059> arm<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.510> always<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> hell<00:00:47.340> let's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
an arm as always what the hell let's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
an arm as always what the hell let's
make<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.940> leg<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> time<00:00:54.230> it's<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> bit

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
make it a leg this time it's got a bit

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.760 
make it a leg this time it's got a bit
of<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> injury<00:00:56.579> there<00:01:00.079> now<00:01:01.079> I'll<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.350> smooth

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of a injury there now I'll just smooth

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
of a injury there now I'll just smooth
that<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.340> smooth<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.879> compress<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> whole

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that to smooth that I compress a whole

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
that to smooth that I compress a whole
shift<00:01:03.719> s<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.159> remove<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.729> just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
shift s and that just remove it it just

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.160 
shift s and that just remove it it just
cleans<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> crunchiness<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:08.240> but<00:01:09.240> now

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
cleans up the crunchiness a bit but now

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.820 
cleans up the crunchiness a bit but now
with<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> cutter<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> cut

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
with the cutter I can I'm going to cut

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
with the cutter I can I'm going to cut
his<00:01:14.070> foot<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.240> ow

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
his foot off ow

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
his foot off ow
and<00:01:16.380> press<00:01:17.369> f9<00:01:18.350> f9<00:01:19.549> automatically<00:01:20.549> creates<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and press f9 f9 automatically creates a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.380 
and press f9 f9 automatically creates a
new<00:01:21.180> layer<00:01:21.409> from<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.740> object<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.909> I'm<00:01:24.090> cut

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
new layer from this object that I'm cut

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.280 
new layer from this object that I'm cut
that<00:01:24.780> I've<00:01:24.990> cut<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:27.570> create<00:01:27.720> drawing<00:01:28.110> from

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that I've cut so to create drawing from

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
that I've cut so to create drawing from
drawing<00:01:28.590> selection<00:01:28.950> I'll<00:01:29.070> call<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> foot<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
drawing selection I'll call a foot and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
drawing selection I'll call a foot and
I'll<00:01:30.930> choose<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> cut<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> artwork<00:01:32.070> from<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I'll choose to cut the artwork from the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.240 
I'll choose to cut the artwork from the
source<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> cut<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> foot<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
source so when I cut the foot off and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
source so when I cut the foot off and
put<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.090> its<00:01:36.210> own<00:01:36.360> layer<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:37.409> won't<00:01:37.680> still

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
put it on its own layer it won't still

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
put it on its own layer it won't still
be<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> original<00:01:39.000> drawing<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
be there on the original drawing so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.399 
be there on the original drawing so
there<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.079> go

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
there we go

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
there we go
so<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.220> I'll<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.400> back<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> original

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
so now I'll go back to the original

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
so now I'll go back to the original
drawing<00:01:42.750> I'll<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.799> hide<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> foot

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
drawing I'll just hide the foot

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
drawing I'll just hide the foot
temporarily<00:01:44.840> once<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:46.110> using<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> cutter

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
temporarily once again using the cutter

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.679 
temporarily once again using the cutter
I'll<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:48.950> include<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> knee<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.729> I'll

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I'll just include the knee and I'll

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.600 
I'll just include the knee and I'll
press<00:01:51.869> f9<00:01:52.140> again<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.280> none<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:55.280> shin

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
press f9 again if none and shin

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.139 
press f9 again if none and shin
it's<00:01:57.390> cut<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:57.990> drawing<00:01:58.259> again<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.189> just

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it's cut there drawing again and just

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.109 
it's cut there drawing again and just
for<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> sake<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:01.460> creating<00:02:02.460> an<00:02:02.670> automatic

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
for the sake of creating an automatic

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
for the sake of creating an automatic
name<00:02:04.280> actually<00:02:05.280> hmm<00:02:06.890> nothing<00:02:08.209> by<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.560> that's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
name actually hmm nothing by so that's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.280 
name actually hmm nothing by so that's
given<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:12.000> number<00:02:12.420> 1<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> end<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
given that a number 1 on the end of the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.790 
given that a number 1 on the end of the
shin<00:02:13.530> be

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

I<00:02:13.830> already<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.490> scene<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> library

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I already have a scene in the library

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.480 
I already have a scene in the library
but<00:02:15.600> you'll<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.200> bit<00:02:16.350> later<00:02:16.740> right

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
but you'll see that a bit later right

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.580 
but you'll see that a bit later right
now<00:02:18.770> using<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.010> pivot<00:02:20.730> tool<00:02:21.350> I'm<00:02:22.350> going<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
now using the pivot tool I'm going to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.160 
now using the pivot tool I'm going to
put<00:02:22.800> these<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:24.120> pivot<00:02:24.420> points<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.960> these

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
put these the pivot points on these

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.250 
put these the pivot points on these
things<00:02:25.500> knee<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.870> thigh<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.570> if<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.810> also

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
things knee and thigh so now if I also

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.390

I'll<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.870> delete<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.860> couple<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.420> frames<00:04:00.420> and

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
I'll just delete a couple of frames and

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.290 
I'll just delete a couple of frames and
at<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> end<00:04:01.739> here<00:04:02.280> I'll<00:04:02.580> turn<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.940> onion

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
at the end here I'll turn on the onion

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.830 
at the end here I'll turn on the onion
skin<00:04:03.660> at<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.770> end<00:04:04.980> here<00:04:05.430> I'll<00:04:05.640> draw<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:06.209> pointed

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
skin at the end here I'll draw a pointed

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.640 
skin at the end here I'll draw a pointed
toe<00:04:07.670> point<00:04:11.480> now<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.780> has<00:04:12.959> appeared<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:13.530> the

the<00:05:04.270> first<00:05:04.510> drawing<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:04.900> can<00:05:04.930> do<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.290> same<00:05:05.470> here

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
the first drawing I can do the same here

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.690 
the first drawing I can do the same here
but<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.520> great<00:05:06.730> thing<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:08.440> this<00:05:08.980> this

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
but the great thing is that this this

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.760 
but the great thing is that this this
element<00:05:10.150> here<00:05:10.480> because<00:05:11.020> I've<00:05:11.140> done<00:05:11.410> three

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
element here because I've done three

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.290 
element here because I've done three
drawings<00:05:12.190> in<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.490> even<00:05:12.700> though<00:05:13.000> they're<00:05:13.270> not

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
drawings in it even though they're not

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.030 
drawings in it even though they're not
showing<00:05:13.660> up<00:05:13.840> here

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
showing up here

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.080 
showing up here
they<00:05:15.400> still<00:05:15.669> exist<00:05:15.700> in<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.270> library<00:05:16.690> which<00:05:17.500> is

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
they still exist in the library which is

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.200 
they still exist in the library which is
awesome<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:19.900> can<00:05:20.200> go<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.440> frame<00:05:21.280> four<00:05:21.880> and

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
awesome so I can go to frame four and

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.690 
awesome so I can go to frame four and
choose<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.229> smiley<00:05:23.620> foot<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.070> there's<00:05:24.550> the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
choose the smiley foot and there's the

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.100 
choose the smiley foot and there's the
smiley<00:05:24.940> foot<00:05:25.210> even<00:05:25.479> though<00:05:25.570> it<00:05:25.690> was<00:05:25.840> nowhere

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
smiley foot even though it was nowhere

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.500 
smiley foot even though it was nowhere
else<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.680> be<00:05:26.710> seen<00:05:27.040> it's<00:05:27.700> still<00:05:28.030> hidden<00:05:28.330> away

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
else to be seen it's still hidden away

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.590 
else to be seen it's still hidden away
I've<00:05:28.900> done<00:05:29.139> that<00:05:29.350> drawing<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.180> Toon<00:05:31.180> Boom<00:05:31.210> has

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
I've done that drawing and Toon Boom has

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.300 
I've done that drawing and Toon Boom has
remembered<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:32.140> so<00:05:32.890> I<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.340> go<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.520> frame<00:05:33.990> 1<00:05:35.310> to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
remembered it so I can go to frame 1 to

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.560 
remembered it so I can go to frame 1 to
frame<00:05:36.460> 7<00:05:36.970> and<00:05:37.380> choose<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.560> pointed<00:05:38.919> toe<00:05:39.130> and

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
frame 7 and choose the pointed toe and

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.880 
frame 7 and choose the pointed toe and
so<00:05:40.570> we've<00:05:40.780> got<00:05:40.930> drawing<00:05:41.200> substitution

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
so we've got drawing substitution

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.950 
so we've got drawing substitution
without<00:05:42.160> using<00:05:43.060> symbols<00:05:44.100> but<00:05:45.100> I<00:05:45.750> want<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:46.810> use

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
without using symbols but I want to use

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.270 
without using symbols but I want to use
I<00:05:47.229> want<00:05:47.380> to<00:05:47.440> introduce<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.919> symbols

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
I want to introduce you to symbols

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.610 
I want to introduce you to symbols
because<00:05:48.490> there<00:05:49.450> are<00:05:49.690> more<00:05:49.990> comfortable<00:05:50.470> to

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
because there are more comfortable to

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.790 
because there are more comfortable to
use<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.039> you<00:05:51.130> can<00:05:51.160> share<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.729> library<00:05:52.180> with

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
use and you can share the library with

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.469 
use and you can share the library with
with<00:05:53.800> other<00:05:54.010> projects<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:55.150> with<00:05:55.300> other

with other projects and with other

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.550 
with other projects and with other
scenes<00:05:56.250> outside<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:57.400> this<00:05:57.490> one<00:05:58.110> whereas<00:05:59.110> the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
scenes outside of this one whereas the

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.630 
scenes outside of this one whereas the
the<00:06:00.900> drawings<00:06:01.900> themselves<00:06:02.500> there<00:06:02.740> they're

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
the drawings themselves there they're

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.760 
the drawings themselves there they're
not<00:06:03.669> as<00:06:04.060> conducive<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:05.380> sharing<00:06:06.570> rides<00:06:07.770> I've

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
not as conducive to sharing rides I've

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.960 
not as conducive to sharing rides I've
gone<00:06:09.070> on<00:06:09.250> long<00:06:09.640> enough

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
gone on long enough

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.200 
gone on long enough
talk<00:06:10.690> to<00:06:10.810> you<00:06:10.900> later<00:06:10.930> bye
