00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.560
 symbiosis and who is attacking that knew 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:20.090
 that the medina does not begin to come alive 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.090
 only from 10h 12h and 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.760
 we did not go to school 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.570
 the tanners waiting for the pam even has a 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.570
 large 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.940
 it is necessary 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.569

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.519
 tanning here at because we were going to see

 1 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.220
 at lunch before 13h treasure what is it 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.750
 that they do but not why I say 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.040
 because we have to take advantage of 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.220
 medina because it's morning is 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:29.200

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.440
 olive tree that we see alas and sorry for 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 the base 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.839
 and it's cool that's where 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.979
 at the base this optics and badly of the 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.409
 lhouest since the feasts 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.119
 but yes it was two hits and 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.889
 who succeeded with this massive crisis 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:52.519
 and that's why but otherwise we have to 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.519
 to be two places 

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:28.509
 of the movie
