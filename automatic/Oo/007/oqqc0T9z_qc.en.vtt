00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I don't really know why I don't have a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.029 
I don't really know why I don't have a
favorite<00:00:20.760> team<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.210> FIFA<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.980> know

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
favorite team in FIFA but I don't know

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.560

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
they seem cool and they were done for

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.120 
they seem cool and they were done for
improvement<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.529> thinking<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.010> know

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
improvement so I was thinking you know

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.589 
improvement so I was thinking you know
what<00:00:26.310> why<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:28.340> but<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.880> starting<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> realize

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
what why not but I'm starting to realize

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
what why not but I'm starting to realize
that<00:00:30.810> somebody<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.619> no<00:00:31.650> experience<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.550> FIFA

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that somebody with no experience in FIFA

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
that somebody with no experience in FIFA
should<00:00:33.390> probably<00:00:33.690> pick<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> better<00:00:34.079> team<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
should probably pick a better team to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.850 
should probably pick a better team to
play<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.930> these<00:00:36.930> guys<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.260> okay<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.739> have
