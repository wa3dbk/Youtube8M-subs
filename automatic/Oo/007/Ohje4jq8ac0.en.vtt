 favorite help is a lot and good 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.079
 basically pretty pretty story no 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.639
 lately we are having good 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.160
 apart from bitch daughters news too 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.189
 we have news that really comes out 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.589
 they were a bit we could say the body and 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.509
 we are having me in little things like that 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.759
 video games help people who 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.029
 is in the hospital and well then 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.439
 at least to carry a little more 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.090
 cope a little more being 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.030
 sick and as such not really 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.010
 as I say video games, they make you 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.600
 also that you forget the bad guys 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.850
 good moments a few days ago 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.789
 specifically on April 23 , 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.710
 suckerpunch criterion the developer 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.750
 of a film the psuv with are therefore 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.260
 restore an image of a kid who 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.090
 he was bedridden in his hospital bed and 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.519
 basically I was playing in his p 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.199
 avoid the nurse is consumed according to 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.269
 I was saying the tweet because I was doing it 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.430
 from a thousand kilometers away 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.110
 where was the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.000
 the price is four of three that with the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.950
 remote play x you can play the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.580
 pressure 4 we work on and we can 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.350
 play with him with the ps vita already then already 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.060
 he provides it a while ago I already made a 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.410
 video has a lacunar poquillo and with 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 polished badly but also because I line 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.979
 it was a bit poopy and well it seems to be 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.900
 that a dualshock online magazine is a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.430
 I wanted to know a little more about this 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.170
 news have come to see the kid 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.810
 and the history of this will not be a little 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.840
 child specifically the young one is called 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.110
 felix you die harvey and he's a boy 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.750
 9-year- old Canadian seems to be 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.820
 that the poor kid has to go through 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.360
 a lot of time in the hospital has some 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.360
 kind of problem 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.259
 what is the digestive system and so on and 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.170
 have to spend a long season 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.140
 apart from very far from your house 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.830
 well 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.960
 prostrate in a hospital bed and without 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.150
 to be able to do absolutely almost nothing 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.520
 is hospitalized in Montreal as I say 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.850
 at a considerable distance from 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.530
 your house and basically 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.660
 the boy then asked his father for power 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.209
 play to be understood with are what you 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.440
 like you can try it then the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.180
 father got down to work and 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.730
 he managed to do it through the remote 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.310
 remote play, this is not the important thing 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.989
 in the news this is really a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.420
 absurd we already know that you could have what 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.190
 important is to see how people who 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.020
 they are in the hospital and others have it 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.239
 well or at least they have what 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.830
 they cope with everything better with a videogame 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.620
 it's not a sign that this helps 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.230
 pretty to the kids 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 and that helps a lot to what are the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.730
 even older people and others not to 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.340
 get distracted and not have so many dollars at 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.409
 After all, I really think that 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.319
 it is a show of courage on the part of the 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.930
 father because other parents who do not 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.940
 they would see neither well nor even that and that gives me 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.260
 a little bit of reale makes certain that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.170
 the games that children should play 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.239
 They should be more in line with what 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.829
 usually do that I also say no if 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.560
 they are for 18 years that's why they have to 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.540
 play 18 years can not play well 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.579
 anybody but not good that already depends 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.590
 of the choice of each parent or the 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.870
 each person's choice so good 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.690
 nothing more kids this has been all and you 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.640
 I leave in the description more data on 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.870
 about this kid the story because the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.600
 you can read also in the description 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.280
 as I say and nothing is nice to see how 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.350
 they cope better with things 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.850
 videogames is not a sector that we 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.860
 like everyone at least guess 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.890
 you want the channel you like it and really 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.290
 Well it's cool to see this kind of little thing 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.500
 so good all the encouragement to this 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.880
 kid and nothing that recovers soon and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.150
 nothing we see it in the next videos the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.150
 next
