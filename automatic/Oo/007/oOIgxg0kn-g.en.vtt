adds<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> shooting<00:00:54.180> process<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
adds to the shooting process so it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
adds to the shooting process so it
performs<00:00:55.469> average<00:00:56.039> me<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> low<00:00:56.760> light

performs average me in the low light

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
performs average me in the low light
conditions<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> life<00:00:58.440> eh<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:59.010> tracking
