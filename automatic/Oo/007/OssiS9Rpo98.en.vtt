hi so we got it maricon dough is made by

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.179 
hi so we got it maricon dough is made by
a<00:00:04.110> small<00:00:04.319> company<00:00:04.799> near<00:00:05.040> Quebec<00:00:05.400> City<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:07.189> the

a small company near Quebec City and the
one<00:00:08.370> feature<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.970> everybody<00:00:09.510> seems<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.840> be

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
one feature that everybody seems to be

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.350 
one feature that everybody seems to be
intrigued<00:00:10.349> about<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.790> tear

drop trailer so your profile your drag
is<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.150> much<00:00:18.330> more<00:00:18.570> efficient<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
is you know it's much more efficient to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.710 
is you know it's much more efficient to
tow<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> normal<00:00:20.160> trailer<00:00:21.029> would<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.330> yes

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
tow than a normal trailer would be yes

tow than a normal trailer would be yes
but<00:00:23.029> inherent<00:00:24.029> drawback<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.720> docks<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
but inherent drawback at your docks is

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.099 
but inherent drawback at your docks is
that<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.529> can't<00:00:25.769> stand<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.109> they've

that you can't stand up in but they've

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.130 
that you can't stand up in but they've
solved<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.160> watch<00:00:29.340> here<00:00:29.960> you'll<00:00:30.960> see

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you can't stand up in them so you're

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
you can't stand up in them so you're
always<00:01:38.549> walking<00:01:38.850> around<00:01:39.090> bent<00:01:39.479> over<00:01:39.799> problem

to to keep the weight down okay feather
otherwise<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> very<00:02:19.400> thin<00:02:20.120> sheet<00:02:20.420> of

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
otherwise it is a very thin sheet of

otherwise it is a very thin sheet of
aluminum<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.080> believe<00:02:21.650> with<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> honeycomb

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
aluminum I believe with a honeycomb

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.820 
aluminum I believe with a honeycomb
plastic<00:02:23.540> structure<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> superlight

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
plastic structure it is a superlight

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.100 
plastic structure it is a superlight
it's<00:02:25.160> almost<00:02:25.430> weightless<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.959> whole

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
it's almost weightless so the whole

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's almost weightless so the whole
thing<00:02:27.320> only<00:02:27.530> weighs<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:28.160> think<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.180> heard<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
thing only weighs I think I heard you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.350 
thing only weighs I think I heard you
mentioned<00:02:29.810> earlier<00:02:30.110> one<00:02:30.290> weighs<00:02:31.360> 2,000

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
mentioned earlier one weighs 2,000

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.030 
mentioned earlier one weighs 2,000
pounds<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.840> all<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> options<00:02:33.440> but<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:33.890> you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
pounds with all the options but as you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.530 
pounds with all the options but as you
mentioned<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.550> does<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:35.000> one<00:02:35.030> drawback

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
mentioned it does have one drawback

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.590 
mentioned it does have one drawback
because<00:02:35.959> it's<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:36.890> lightweight<00:02:37.130> namely<00:02:37.970> it's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
because it's so lightweight namely it's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.440 
because it's so lightweight namely it's
not<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.860> wonderful<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.820> really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
not going to be wonderful in really

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.300 
not going to be wonderful in really
really<00:02:42.020> cold<00:02:42.290> conditions

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
really cold conditions

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.810 
really cold conditions
well<00:02:44.680> because<00:02:45.680> it's<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.950> trade-off<00:02:46.250> weight

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
well because it's a trade-off weight

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.759 
well because it's a trade-off weight
versus<00:02:47.480> insulation<00:02:48.410> there<00:02:50.260> I've<00:02:51.260> wondered<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
versus insulation there I've wondered it

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.410 
versus insulation there I've wondered it
you<00:02:52.070> wonder<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:52.430> aerogel<00:02:53.000> would<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.390> a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
you wonder if aerogel would be a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.360 
you wonder if aerogel would be a
solution<00:02:53.840> or<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.590> they<00:02:54.709> could<00:02:54.769> have<00:02:55.010> put

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
solution or if they could have put

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.250 
solution or if they could have put
urethane<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.360> something<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:56.840> these<00:02:56.959> honeycomb
