assisting<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> newer<00:00:37.079> players<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.550> let

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
assisting the newer players is to let

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.180 
assisting the newer players is to let
them<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.510> destroyed<00:00:40.020> by<00:00:40.079> stronger<00:00:40.920> players

you pick a gun you sort of become

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
you pick a gun you sort of become
comfortable<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.090> every<00:01:36.600> time<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> get

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
comfortable with it every time you get

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
comfortable with it every time you get
on<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> map<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.770> learn<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.850> opening<00:01:39.299> routes

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
on a map you learn your opening routes

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
on a map you learn your opening routes
where<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.729> eventually<00:01:41.729> becoming

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
where to go and eventually becoming

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
where to go and eventually becoming
really<00:01:42.299> comfortable<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.200> game<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
really comfortable with the game and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950 
really comfortable with the game and
then<00:01:44.159> he<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.579> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.000> close<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.270> skill<00:01:45.750> gap

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
then he was able to close the skill gap

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960 
then he was able to close the skill gap
between<00:01:46.259> him<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> those<00:01:47.189> stronger<00:01:47.700> players

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
between him and those stronger players

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.460 
between him and those stronger players
who<00:01:48.570> had<00:01:48.689> been<00:01:48.840> playing<00:01:49.079> first-person

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
who had been playing first-person

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770 
who had been playing first-person
shooters<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.310> years<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> game<00:01:51.600> was

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
shooters for years and now the game was

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
shooters for years and now the game was
a<00:01:51.810> lot<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.200> fun<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.680> him<00:01:52.860> he<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.189> getting

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
a lot more fun to him he was getting

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600 
a lot more fun to him he was getting
more<00:01:53.790> killstreaks<00:01:54.479> etc<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
more killstreaks etc and I think that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.069 
more killstreaks etc and I think that
was<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:56.969> cool<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.719> something

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
was really cool and this is something

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.350 
was really cool and this is something
that<00:01:58.110> black<00:01:58.950> ops<00:01:59.159> 2<00:01:59.369> sort<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.729> messed<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that black ops 2 sort of messed up I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.580 
that black ops 2 sort of messed up I
think<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.869> skill<00:02:01.200> based<00:02:01.409> matchmaking

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
think that skill based matchmaking

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.770 
think that skill based matchmaking
should<00:02:02.490> never<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.880> been<00:02:03.000> implemented<00:02:03.390> into

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
should never have been implemented into

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
should never have been implemented into
this<00:02:04.110> public<00:02:04.649> matchmaking<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this public matchmaking I think it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
this public matchmaking I think it
should<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.570> been<00:02:06.930> left<00:02:07.530> alone<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
should have been left alone with the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
should have been left alone with the
league<00:02:08.489> play<00:02:08.759> league<00:02:09.030> play<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.209> cool<00:02:09.569> i<00:02:09.599> really

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
league play league play is cool i really

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.839 
league play league play is cool i really
think<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.470> fun<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.160> i<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.520> it's

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
think it's fun but i don't think it's

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
think it's fun but i don't think it's
something<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.599> ton<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> people<00:02:13.170> are<00:02:13.260> going

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
something that a ton of people are going

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
something that a ton of people are going
to<00:02:13.560> be

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to be

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.260 
to be
I<00:02:13.950> especially<00:02:14.370> don't<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.060> something

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I especially don't think it's something

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.330 
I especially don't think it's something
that<00:02:15.630> needed<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.440> forced<00:02:17.160> down<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that needed to be forced down the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
that needed to be forced down the
players<00:02:17.700> throats<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.660> skill

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930

based matchmaking here in black ops 2 in
public<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:23.280> think<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.970> huge

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
public and I think that is a huge

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.210 
public and I think that is a huge
mistake<00:02:24.810> however<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.740> something<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.160> I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
mistake however it is something that I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.470 
mistake however it is something that I
don't<00:02:26.400> think<00:02:26.610> we're<00:02:26.700> gonna<00:02:26.790> get<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.240> see
