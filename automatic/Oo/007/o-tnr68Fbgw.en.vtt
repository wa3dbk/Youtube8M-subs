 of the system of short games are 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.660
 using a new engine the collisions 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.570
 they look much more realistic and also each 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.430
 one of the players the reaction and how 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.600
 they feel is completely different from 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.350
 for your position you are talking to me 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.509
 I do not understand anything wonderful one or one and 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.610
 bourdais I know but we did not get that 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.590
 here in mexico friend there is a base of 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.240
 fans very big line of the following the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.130
 nfl game party and they are 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.780
 waiting every year for a new delivery of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.120
 madden so good let's see the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.960
 review of more than 25 that is prepared 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.640
 and in game tv we are watching 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.759
 worked 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.280
 gamers pray madden nfl 25 football 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.069
 American is the sport that more income 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.840
 generated in the USA for that reason 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.990
 franchises have taken such discipline 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.539
 as a foundation in the last 25 years 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.759
 although very good games have emerged 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.030
 few have stood the test of time 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.890
 as the esports saga which celebrates 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.009
 this quarter of a century with madden nfl 25 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 developed by the shark the study 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.810
 traditionally in charge of these 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.289
 games 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.299
 madden nfl 25 has the premise to improve 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.030
 the mechanics that have made the 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.369
 series to be one of its most games 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 sold and be focused solely on 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.290
 a solid league should not be surprised that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.840
 you see more work in this title than 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.720
 in other series of electronic arts as 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.269
 fifa said work is notorious only 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.489
 taking control of the game run 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.040
 ball was usually a little option 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.620
 attractive however the grand system 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.080
 prix not only adds a balance in the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.819
 so that the acceleration of the players 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.760
 be as realistic as it looks in 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.459
 television also adds 30 movements 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.549
 to maintain the race and reach the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.069
 diagonals apart from the acceleration and the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.560
 address you can also try jump 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.170
 about your tacklers or use the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.440
 right stick to evade or recover the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 balance or a more organic system in 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 the plays by land we must add a 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.549
 more polished handling in the marshals of 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.290
 field who now have times of 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.140
 reaction to prepare the pass 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.120
 depending on your abilities likewise 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.220
 the receiver options will open 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.079
 depending on how far you reach 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.840
 when you see it and at what time 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.239
 uncheck if that is not enough we have 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.450
 a physics system named infinite and 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.280
 2 its operation is basic takes in 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.129
 count the body constitution of each 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.319
 player the speed and angle of the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.209
 tackles to produce impacts that you 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.940
 will remember the blows you see every 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.859
 Sunday or Monday night is worth the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.500
 worth noting that we still appreciate 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.280
 unrealistic reactions and some that 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.290
 another accident 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.560
 car instead of a tackle 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.720
 but the improvement is evident by making it clear 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 that the important thing is that it looks good and 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.020
 coherent 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.720
 before realist important part of 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.060
 this experience are the new modes of 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.370
 game the main one is racing 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.040
 connected in which can be both 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.860
 a player a coach and the owner of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.989
 a franchise making decisions that 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.330
 made popular to each modality returns 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.940
 since the creation of a profile and a 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.910
 own story to the appearance and in 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.830
 the case of an athlete his skills with 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.080
 you have the mission to build a 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.000
 legacy that makes the difference and takes you 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.359
 to have a place in the hall of fame 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.980
 from canton ohio you will build it by meeting 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.350
 the goals of the season as 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.540
 coach establish a domain in the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.160
 field as a player or taking the 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.550
 financial and sports decisions 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.370
 right as tycoon sounds boring 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.290
 play to be an entrepreneur but having the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.690
 possibility of revoking equipment in 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.970
 cities like the df or a broad 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.900
 manipulation in aspects such as image 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.840
 or the prices to charge usually 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.729
 generate interesting experiences not 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.759
 we can forget about the graphic section 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.070
 in do not expect a radical change in 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.919
 the models of the players not much 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.440
 less fluid animations have only 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.389
 passed by a little cat hand was seen in 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.669
 special in the adoption of the new 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.060
 uniforms while having a better 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.759
 definition however the jump is not 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.770
 so spectacular and maybe we should wait 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.900
 the version in the new generation for 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.410
 find much more substantial improvements 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.960
 the new rules of the nfl as the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.419
 starting kicks at greater distance or the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.130
 review of controversial moves are not 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.979
 the only changes you'll see in the 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.960
 game mechanics obviously played 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.150
 same as the previous ones and the objective 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.460
 is the same that does not mean that it is the 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.710
 best title of the series to date 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.139
 the game modes are very funny 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.419
 both locally and online at the time 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.259
 that continues the ultimate team modality 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.389
 so you can build your dream team 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.639
 in addition to its scarce graphical improvements and 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.750
 the short distance in general with respect to 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.330
 the previous delivery 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.400
 the only but real that we could 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.100
 to put the game is that its novelties 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.220
 may expire in a few months when 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.500
 list the edition of playstation 4 and xbox 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.960
 one and yet if you have been away 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.990
 of the madden series or if you need the 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.490
 this year's delivery have a value 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.410
 good enough to have it already 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.610
 you have to wait for the arrival 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.759
