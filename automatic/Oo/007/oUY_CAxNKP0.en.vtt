00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.660
 we are going to take the most clarito of our 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.990
 I will apply the correctors wheel in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.180
 the eyelid as a prime under the eye 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.660
 to light up because we are going to manage 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 very bright tonalities we want 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.060
 have a lot of lighting for those of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.029
 makeup we're going to need water a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 thin brochita and in this case I will 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.110
 choose a pink shade carefully 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.110
 I'm going to start applying it on the eyelid 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.680
 and let's wait for it to dry 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.680
 to create a second layer of paint 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.350
 we are going to clean that is very defined 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.370
 let's wait for it to dry and now 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.990
 without wetting a whole said pink and I apply it 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.990
 with little touches 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.120
 I'm going to take a little rose and add a little 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.450
 from hue to the top of the bread 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.390
 I'm going to take a very dark brown pencil and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.910
 I'm going to start filling nothing else where 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.720
 the eyebrow has small holes I will not take 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.720
 the black pencil 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 we are going to apply many layers of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.820
 black mascara 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.900
 I'm going to take a very clear pink and go 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.900
 to apply it on the sides 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.640
 and we are going to apply nothing else effect follow 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.789
 for this dynamic we are going to apply the 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.530
 more clearly from our wheel of 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.530
 correctors make-ups 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.009
 so that our shadows in the most 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.250
 fidelity once I want to invite you 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.549

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.069

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.560
 down and now I'm going to go with a yellow 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.160
 off this do not make it too loud 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 and I'm going to apply it at the beginning of 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.760
 eyelid 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:39.950
 I'm going a little bit more towards the middle 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.970
 I'm going to take this orange and also 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.780
 wetting the rosita I will apply it in the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 next half 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:59.620
 the next tonality is a red 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.620
 and we are going to apply it at the end 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.280
 we apply correct face 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.060
 we let them know the edges we take a 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.710
 black eyeliner and we make a tiny 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.210
 very thin line attached to the eyelashes 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.970
 I'm going to take the warning for nothing more 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.730
 we return to the same where there are holes 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.890
 in the fence and here with an eyeliner 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.180
 golden we can use shadow I'll 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.810
 delineate by applying several layers of mascara 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.690
 and also on the lower lashes 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.480
 as optional they can leave it as well as 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.110
 we are driving now not line down or 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.110
 put a thin black line on the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.120
 inside and good you can change 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.390
 the tone of your lipstick if you do not like the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.890
 Golden 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.890
