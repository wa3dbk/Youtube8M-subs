00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
and talk a left with with almost the

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:49.109 
and talk a left with with almost the
same<00:04:34.749> amount<00:04:34.899> of<00:04:35.429> water<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:48.639> half<00:04:48.819> way

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:49.119 
same amount of water the half way

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:50.959 
same amount of water the half way
because<00:04:49.569> when<00:04:49.809> a<00:04:49.839> boil<00:04:50.139> phone<00:04:50.469> with<00:04:50.649> that

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
because when a boil phone with that

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.999 
because when a boil phone with that
really<00:04:51.969> is<00:04:52.749> that<00:04:52.959> if<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.319> make<00:04:53.649> it<00:04:53.709> through

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
really is that if you make it through

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.769 
really is that if you make it through
slowly<00:04:55.799> so<00:04:56.799> you<00:04:57.129> can<00:04:57.339> add<00:04:57.759> the<00:04:58.299> vegetables

00:04:58.769 --> 00:04:58.779 
slowly so you can add the vegetables

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.779
