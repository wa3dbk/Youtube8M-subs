00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
as much as I did I didn't but they were

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
as much as I did I didn't but they were
a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.390> thought<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> bounces

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a little off I thought the bounces

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.780 
a little off I thought the bounces
looked<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.710> weird<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.579> are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
looked a little weird and you are

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.700 
looked a little weird and you are
supposed<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> bounce<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> Samba<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
supposed to bounce in the Samba but I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.340 
supposed to bounce in the Samba but I
think<00:01:47.009> her<00:01:47.880> shoulders<00:01:48.509> were<00:01:48.540> throwing<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.200> off

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
think her shoulders were throwing me off

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.830 
think her shoulders were throwing me off
well<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.340> thought<00:01:50.909> Alec<00:01:51.299> had<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:51.659> really

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
well like I thought Alec had some really

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
well like I thought Alec had some really
tough<00:01:52.170> choreography<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.250> her<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> they

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
tough choreography for her and they

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
tough choreography for her and they
pulled<00:01:54.180> off<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> Samba<00:01:54.930> rolls<00:01:55.110> pretty<00:01:55.439> good<00:01:55.680> I
