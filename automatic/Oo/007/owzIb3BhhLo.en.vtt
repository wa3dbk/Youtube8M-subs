00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.610
 in venezuela new ones are presented 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.440
 construction technologies that 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.660
 adapt to all shapes and styles 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.520
 architectural panels 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.100
 prefabricated are the evolution of 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.840
 constructive process in the country these 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.360
 are the result of a process 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.540
 industrial that ensures high quality 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.550
 low costs and speed 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.410
 next we will know the process of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.310
 production in the leading company of 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.310
 Venezuelan market 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 with house 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.500
 us in the department projects 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.770
 we use a program in which we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.220
 allows the paralysis of the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.370
 housing and this indicates stoppage 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.180
 In detail the size of the panel 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.150
 wide the typology the location of the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.090
 panel to make a little more practical and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.030
 simple assembly of housing in 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.970
 the site of the work 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.560
 the project department is responsible 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.750
 to send the features and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.330
 specifications of the panels so that 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.610
 can be manufactured the process of 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.950
 production starts in the expander machine 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.990
 that will be responsible for transforming the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 raw material in polystyrene beads 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.620
 by means of a hydration process 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.010
 with water vapor 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.130
 I have gone to what is the pre-machine 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.130
 defender is the one in charge of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.640
 expand the material then move to a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.320
 fluid bed where your process begins 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.320
 drying and cooling 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 while the polystyrene goes through a 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.920
 drying and cooling process 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.770
 the operator take samples for 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 control its density later is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.409
 sent through conduits for the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.110
 Painting process is then stored 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.320
 in silos where it must stand between 24 and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.640
 48 hours the selection of the centuries 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.950
 performed by a system 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.290
 computerized that allows to visualize the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.480
 availability of them and schedule 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.610
 sending the material to the second 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.610
 production phase the block 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.700
 I communicate with my partner and he 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.709
 send the material 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.069
 after the material is in the peat 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.230
 of the block we proceed and activate the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.319
 will block and she starts doing the cycle 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.280
 of procedure for the block to be 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.190
 form inside the block 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.319
 once it leaves the block is moved 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.240
 to a Roman where you take the weight and you 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.030
 controls density according to type 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.640
 panel requested by the client that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.040
 can be understood from number 15 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.600
 up to number 18 the panels are 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.850
 stored indicating their 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.930
 specifications to be sent later 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.930
 to the cutting machine 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.819
 in this phase the cuts of the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.819
 block 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.700
 It is given longitudinal and vertical cut 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.800
 through a cnc program that we 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.980
 we prepare the saved program and 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.480
 is used for another cut is also 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.450
 followed continuously between the same 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 production 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.430
 this series of cuts are made in a way 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.140
 automatic by a machine that chooses the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.319
 the most efficient way to make the kit 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.300
 requested by the design department 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.980
 the waste of the cuts are sent 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.980
 to a mill to be recycled 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.230
 the cut panels are sent to 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.849
 storage or to the milling machine 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.849
 that makes special cuts 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.640
 good with strawberry now what we are 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.250
 realizing is to embed the pipeline 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.620
 white water black water embed 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.380
 also what energy once what 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.110
 is the point of light to make it more 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.720
 easy assembly of the box with 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.760
 this system allows you to concrete 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.950
 prepare the kits so that 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.760
 including the space for the pipes and 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.860
 electrical installations to do the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.650
 finished panel wire is needed 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.529
 three millimeters this one is cut into threads 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.409
 with a computerized dora integrity 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:39.009
 it is a software so all the programs 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.510
 of each measurement then you pass here to 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.640
 system 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.320
 what is a sensor that tells you when the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.330
 wire passes up there the cut 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.460
 we gave him kayaking to the extent he was grab 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.140
 the Hindu the thousands you have the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.820
 appropriate measure and then passes the 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.530
 procedure that the boss of mine 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.270
 it requires that you kiss that production the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.270
 today or the next day 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.100
 the wire cuts are sent to 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.950
 The electro spot welding machine 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.530
 someone we put the wires long of 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.710
 transverse hair the 19 are safe by 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.160
 second here where we form the mesh is 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.000
 a work can be removed 120 mesh 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.480
 depending on the measure if they were made 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.460
 very long average you can take out 80 90 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.370
 meshes when they are short measure so 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.810
 less than 3 meters down can be 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.810
 take out 120 130 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.229
 the meshes are transferred to the machine 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.659
 isadora panel this machine takes care of 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.210
 place a mesh on both sides of the 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:44.090
 polystyrene the final product is a 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.200
 panel ready to be assembled the 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:50.410
 analyzer function is to put 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.230
 2 maya an anime panel by ones 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.540
 wire connectors and an electro 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.710
 welder first we put a mesh 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.900
 down then we placed the anime panel 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.780
 and then we put the mesh on top with 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.420
 6 connectors and each arm has its roll 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.670
 next door and the machine is responsible for putting 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.190
 the connectors automatically more or 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.580
 less for 30 seconds each panel of 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.580
 3 meters 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.500
 for the construction of dwellings 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.690
 they require different cuts of meshes 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.699
 that will be used to strengthen the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.740
 panels to join the corners and 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.810
 strengthen the structures 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:35.389
 through the menu there are two types of measure 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:38.620
 mesh there is one of 150 and one of 75 of 75 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.889
 we use it for what is maya flat 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.510
 that the house stand of the panel 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:48.250
 of the same 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:50.710
 of 150 the pass we use it for what 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.660
 maya and maya is money 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.050
 for now you can cut two hundred 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.050
 tights 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.750
 the use of structural panels 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.300
 polystyrene offers great advantages 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.960
 about the traditional walls because they are 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.800
 lightweight thermal insulators 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.629
 at the energy efficient fire 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.210
 resistant to versatile earthquakes 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.879
 economic and facilitate construction 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.280
 have shown a rapid acceptance of 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:27.449
 consumer due to the ease of their 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.849
 assembly and its structural strength with 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:32.490
 which house adapts the technology with which 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.650
 world to the structural demands of 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.779
 venezuela through the manufacture of 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.180
 this kit model and standardization 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:41.939
 of a complete production cycle that 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.400
 guarantees efficient constructions of 

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:46.039
 high quality and low costs 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.930
 using national raw material 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:50.580
 generating job stability and 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.349
 assuming your commitment to 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.349
 associated responsibility
