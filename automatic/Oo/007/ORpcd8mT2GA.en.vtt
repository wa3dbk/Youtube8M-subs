 hello to all here today I'm going 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.719
 show you how to make a lighthouse elected 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 with a paper towel 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 first of all we will need a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.369
 paper towel with patterns or in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.670
 color that we will open at large 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 white side once an internet will be 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.430
 open 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:30.439
 we'll have to fold each corner in the middle 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.130
 like these and repeat the operation 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.130
 for all corners 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 once we get this form 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:00.430
 we will have to do exactly the same thing 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.239
 with its corners bring them back to the middle 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.239
 like this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.350
 once we finish this step 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.880
 we will have to start again with each 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.880
 corner like this 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.179
 once we get this form 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.560
 it will be necessary to return your towel 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:44.119
 like these and bring each corner back to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.119
 middle like this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.210
 once we brought back each 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.580
 corner he'll have to take the towel 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.610
 in your hand like these were going 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.650
 look for the back corner and the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.920
 bring back on the front like these one a 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.440
 time we did this step there 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.830
 will have to do the same for each 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.770
 corner like these were going to fetch the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.320
 back leaf and bring it back as 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.380
 those were going to get the sheet of 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.670
 behind and brought her back to this corner and 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.570
 this one once we're done 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.900
 this step it will have to go get 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.080
 the leaf behind it here 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.790
 like this so that it makes a sheet 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:03:01.690
 in addition to the water lily and do like this 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:03.610
 for each leaf like these a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.730
 once we finish this step there 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.280
