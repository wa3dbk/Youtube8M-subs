 encourage me to read in English because I've 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.669
 read so many times harry potter that I've 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.560
 I think that I will be able to agree 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.960
 English that I have stopped reading them without 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.180
 problems just do not read English 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.979
 for laziness so I 'm going to cheer up with 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.860
 harry potter that is something that never gives me 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:52.250
 lazy to read or see or talk about harry 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.660
 potter so it's nothing like that has been 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.539
