what<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.390> wig<00:02:18.660> looks<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.379> all<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.890> way

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
what this wig looks like all the way

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.509 
what this wig looks like all the way
around<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.769> this<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.220> looks<00:02:23.430> like

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
around so this is what it looks like

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:33.259 
around so this is what it looks like
from<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.180> side<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.780> then<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.290> back<00:02:32.030> which<00:02:33.030> is

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
from the side and then the back which is

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.569 
from the side and then the back which is
really<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:35.000> not<00:02:36.000> even<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.459> what

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
really really not even so this is what

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.850 
really really not even so this is what
it<00:02:38.670> looks<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.450> back<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.680> this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
it looks like on the back and then this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.660 
it looks like on the back and then this
is<00:02:43.980> what<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.220> looks<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.519> from<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.000> side

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.809 

so<00:02:51.240> if<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.810> was<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.440> shift<00:02:52.800> my<00:02:53.069> wig<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
so if I was to like shift my wig it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.699 
so if I was to like shift my wig it
wouldn't<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.390> even<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.959> one<00:02:55.200> side<00:02:55.440> will<00:02:55.590> be

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
wouldn't be even like one side will be

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.190 
wouldn't be even like one side will be
shorter<00:02:56.069> than<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> other<00:02:56.520> but<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.000> won't<00:02:57.240> look

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
shorter than the other but it won't look

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.740 
shorter than the other but it won't look
right<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.120> at<00:03:00.300> an<00:03:00.510> angle

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
right so I have to have it at an angle

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.490 
right so I have to have it at an angle
in<00:03:01.110> order<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:02.150> be<00:03:03.150> even<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:04.080> both<00:03:04.440> sides

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
in order for it to be even on both sides

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.530 
in order for it to be even on both sides
because<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.730> wasn't<00:03:06.150> cut<00:03:06.410> even<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.090> yeah<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
because it wasn't cut even so yeah I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.810
