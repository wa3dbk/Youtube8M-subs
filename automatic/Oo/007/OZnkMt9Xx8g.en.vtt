game playing better than NBA 2k11 which

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.380 
game playing better than NBA 2k11 which
many<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.170> agree<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.010> best<00:00:47.340> 2k<00:00:48.030> game

I<00:01:32.640> play<00:01:33.270> unreal<00:01:33.659> shooting<00:01:34.140> percentage<00:01:34.590> for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I play unreal shooting percentage for

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.010 
I play unreal shooting percentage for
both<00:01:34.950> shooting<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> free<00:01:36.450> throws<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.810> think

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
both shooting and free throws I think

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.850 
both shooting and free throws I think
that's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> most<00:01:37.470> realistic<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.250> play<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
that's the most realistic way to play I

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.830 
that's the most realistic way to play I
think<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> stays<00:01:41.490> truest<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> ratings<00:01:42.630> as

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
think it stays truest to the ratings as

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.469 
think it stays truest to the ratings as
opposed<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.740> user<00:01:43.950> timing<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.210> see

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
opposed to the user timing you can see

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.649 
opposed to the user timing you can see
the<00:01:45.600> rest<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> stuff<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.500> here

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
the rest of the stuff right down here

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.450 
the rest of the stuff right down here
everything<00:01:48.659> else<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.170> default

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460 

alright<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.729> we'll<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.720> user<00:01:54.960> sliders

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
