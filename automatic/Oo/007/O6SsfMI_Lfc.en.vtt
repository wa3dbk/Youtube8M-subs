00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.379
 after mister livain waved 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.230
 all pen and went to do another project 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.390
 on the fragile shoulders of the remaining blunt marine 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.989
 for the clan a simple task to do 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.519
 continuation of one of the most exciting games 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.339
 2007 let me say that 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.530
 the original was quite succinctly finished and 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.250
 thoughts about further development but not 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.409
 it hurt something 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.809
 scratched such a turnip and thought and maybe 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.600
 then joke down after a long 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.729
 time the game was positioned that way in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.619
 principle, the idea was logical because you can 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.020
 there was much to tell about that 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.290
 happened yes the fateful events of the riot 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.270
 new year but then either cryo stars 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 agreed whether something else happened on 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.030
 bioshock 2 turned into a hodgepodge 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.009
 different time periods apparently deciding 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 that bioshock didn't break the community on 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.799
 a tear 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.909
 the developers brought a good ride 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.909
 dramatic story 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.980
 the ocean 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.130
 but 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.009
 from the very first frames someone could run from 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.680
 joy gave us steer for himself 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.170
 big daddy character original 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.730
 games 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.550
 we report kind of such a measure later 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.860
 whole ten years traditional questions 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.890
 and climb in the head but we immediately 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.060
 dragging the thick of things 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.010
 the first thing that catches your eye immediately 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.130
 now we can freely use 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.650
 two hands at the same time joyfully 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.750
 drilling all brown and shoot lightning we 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.460
 with its tramp and rush to save 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.380
 matured cottage 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.600
 according to the laws of sequels everything is fine 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.430
 understand that bioshock 2 must still 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.550
 something different from its predecessor 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.570
 the only problem was that this was all 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.480
 and ends 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.670
 such either were afraid to spoil either 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 there were no original ideas Beasley War 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.570
 of course the levels got bigger and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.270
 more varied and the rapture itself is crumbling on 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.930
 eyes but with the atmosphere 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.570
 time you will not surprise anyone plasmids 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
 the most important trump card of the series 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.130
 altogether copied almost without 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.870
 changes at the end of only one new 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.700
 the valley is so pure in plot 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.980
 the story itself looks pretty 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 strange and we throw out a whole heap 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.940
 new heroes unrelated to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.160
 last part except tenenbaum and 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.080
 late ryan we don't know anyone and 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 time span and no way 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.610
 saves the player from the questions why 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.070
 nothing was heard about like if she 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.170
 made such an impact why she 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.930
 back in 10 years 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.760
 after perfect well the whole song 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.710
 with refrain 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 about 1 half of the game we are hanging around 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.930
 delight performs native tasks in 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.270
 find the spirit bring and turn it on then 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.070
 the game gradually begins to recruit 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.430
 turnovers turning the final level 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.800
 a wild race of hell around rushing coups 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.550
 Slicers and big daddy everything burns and 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.230
 explodes and we still sink to heap 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.020
 It's worth noting that you were gay. 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.150
 New varieties of enemies and weapons and I 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 the latter is more correct to use the word for 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.070
 less they supplemented 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.319
 everything else to the game screwed 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.020
 multiplayer where we have to fight 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.990
 with other players for dominance in the game 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.780
 the coolest thing that would seem to be quite 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.530
 non scene mode authors added this 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.169
 the very plot 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.330
 we fight not just left kartoha 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.719
 during the new year satin riot 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.030
 which caused the destruction of the city end 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:02.729
 modes we observe the plane crash on 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.409
 which flew jerry the result bioshock 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.169
 2 looks like a real simulator 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.139
 big folder tell us all 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.969
 Under the roof of communication they give sisters 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.310
 personally ride them on your shoulder so that they 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.939
 collected adam and protect from creepy 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.099
 addicts but finally the authors created 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.669
 more variations of moral choice and 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.830
 of all 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.349
 which change subtly depending on 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.909
 your decisions 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.719
 we are given the opportunity to steer not only 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.879
 for big daddy 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.439
 but because of my sister clearly showing 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.819
 why they always say such 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.189
 phrases 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.589
 honestly the level where it was necessary 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.580
 collect a suit for leonora is generally 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.580
 one of the best in the game 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:58.939
 this piece of costume 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.939
 find the rest 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.229
 and again it turns out pretty 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.840
 dual situation like we have 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.419
 much more dramatic story 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.490
 seasoned with tear gut music 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.060
 at the same time, they no longer touched 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.699
 for what 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.910
 design remains the same key elements 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.410
 did not touch a big sister who 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.630
 for a long time it was generally considered 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.070
 antagonist of the game 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.070
 undeservedly merged to the level of mini-boss and 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.430
 well then it's the fault of tuks here or not 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.400
 We will soon find out because now we will 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.560
 something to compare this game because I already 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.020
 in a few weeks we will see 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.030
 real bioshock with brand new 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.740
 setting gameplay elements and 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.740
 surely kenom military helm
