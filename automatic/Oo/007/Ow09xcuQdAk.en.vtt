00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
at how the edge curves around that was

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.550 
at how the edge curves around that was
very<00:04:16.790> good<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.389> straightened<00:04:17.810> out<00:04:17.930> just<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
very good it straightened out just the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
edge and that's right

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.990
