00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
a shot it's that first flight let's see

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
a shot it's that first flight let's see
how<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> goes<00:00:54.949> giving<00:00:55.949> me<00:00:56.039> your<00:00:56.100> flight

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
how it goes giving me your flight

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.200 
how it goes giving me your flight
controls<00:00:56.760> check<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.300> yeah<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> got

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
controls check there yeah I know I got

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.779 
controls check there yeah I know I got
fifth<00:01:00.210> row<00:01:00.480> left<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.280> all<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
fifth row left right all right we do a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.289 
fifth row left right all right we do a
little<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.210> tack<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> tail<00:01:05.790> wheel<00:01:06.060> is

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
little little tack see the tail wheel is

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.580 
little little tack see the tail wheel is
attached<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> rudder<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> actually

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
attached to the rudder so you actually

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.899 
attached to the rudder so you actually
get<00:01:07.890> ground<00:01:08.220> steering<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:10.549> gets<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.760> off

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
get ground steering and gets right off

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
get ground steering and gets right off
the<00:01:12.060> ground<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:14.600> have<00:01:15.600> never<00:01:15.810> flown<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.439> RC

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the ground I have never flown an RC

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
the ground I have never flown an RC
airplane<00:01:17.159> before<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.850> could<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.060> really

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
airplane before so this could be really

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.679 
airplane before so this could be really
interesting

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:30.910 

was<00:01:21.689> although<00:01:21.899> easy

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.959 

whoo
