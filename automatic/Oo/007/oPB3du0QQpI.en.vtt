okay<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.949> here's<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.490> i<00:00:02.520> approach<00:00:02.820> doing

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
okay so here's how i approach doing

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.140 
okay so here's how i approach doing
getting<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.380> Latin<00:00:04.799> feel<00:00:05.100> for<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.670> song<00:00:05.879> a

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
getting the Latin feel for the song a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:17.600 
getting the Latin feel for the song a
lot<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.779> has<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.899> do<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> baseline

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.670 

so<00:00:18.270> again<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> starting<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:18.990> G<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.320> basically

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
so again you starting in G but basically

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.490 
so again you starting in G but basically
you're<00:00:19.800> going<00:00:20.100> C<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.490> F<00:00:21.560> B<00:00:22.560> flat

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880 

2d<00:00:26.160> vintagey<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.140> use<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> lot<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.440> what's<00:00:28.710> called

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
2d vintagey i use a lot of what's called

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.780 
2d vintagey i use a lot of what's called
approach<00:00:29.310> notes<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.450> C<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.200> F

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
approach notes so if I'm going C to F

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.750 
approach notes so if I'm going C to F
I'll<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:33.090> something<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:36.920> septum<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.370> up

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
I'll use something like septum up to up

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.410 
I'll use something like septum up to up
to<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> Harvey<00:00:39.270> whatever<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:42.300> I'm

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to you Harvey whatever you like then I'm

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.860 
to you Harvey whatever you like then I'm
going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.960> flat<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.970> I<00:00:45.030> used<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.390> half<00:00:45.600> step

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
going to be flat so I used a half step

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.890 
going to be flat so I used a half step
approach<00:00:46.199> note<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.830> flat<00:00:47.100> next<00:00:47.940> pitch<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
approach note to be flat next pitch is a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.200 
approach note to be flat next pitch is a
flat<00:00:49.199> so<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> might<00:00:49.769> use

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.030 

okay<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:52.750> I'm<00:00:52.930> using<00:00:53.110> either<00:00:53.350> whole<00:00:53.710> step

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
okay so I'm using either whole step

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.680 
okay so I'm using either whole step
approach<00:00:54.280> notes<00:00:54.670> or<00:00:54.850> half<00:00:55.120> step<00:00:55.420> approach

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
approach notes or half step approach

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.210 
approach notes or half step approach
note<00:00:57.120> okay<00:00:58.120> they<00:00:58.600> both<00:00:58.840> work<00:00:59.110> but<00:00:59.140> one<00:00:59.710> gives<00:01:00.129> a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
note okay they both work but one gives a

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.619 
note okay they both work but one gives a
little<00:01:00.340> more<00:01:00.430> tension<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.090> half<00:01:01.210> step<00:01:01.449> gives

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
little more tension the half step gives

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.890 
little more tension the half step gives
a<00:01:01.690> little<00:01:01.809> more<00:01:01.899> attention

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:16.610 

okay<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:06.960> start<00:01:07.350> off<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.710> sea

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:28.340 

now<00:01:17.340> apply<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> rhythm<00:01:18.660> to<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.410 

okay<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.399> right<00:01:30.549> hand<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.179> have

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
okay in the right hand you have

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.940 
okay in the right hand you have
hopefully<00:01:32.140> already<00:01:32.560> watched<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.859> other

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
hopefully already watched the other

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.340 
hopefully already watched the other
video<00:01:33.280> on<00:01:33.340> voicing<00:01:34.060> but<00:01:34.539> you<00:01:34.719> have<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.960> exactly

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
video on voicing but you have as exactly

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.050 
video on voicing but you have as exactly
how<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> voice<00:01:41.799> it<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.219> other<00:01:42.310> video<00:01:42.670> but

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
how I voice it in the other video but

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.639 
how I voice it in the other video but
now<00:01:43.210> applying<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:43.929> rhythm<00:01:44.200> basically<00:01:44.560> I'm

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
now applying the rhythm basically I'm

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.859 
now applying the rhythm basically I'm
just<00:01:44.710> doing<00:01:44.979> my<00:01:45.009> thumb<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:46.179> then<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.569> rest<00:01:46.750> of

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
just doing my thumb and then the rest of

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.870 
just doing my thumb and then the rest of
my<00:01:47.020> hand<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:48.009> I'm<00:01:48.219> saying<00:01:48.459> is<00:01:48.520> I'm<00:01:48.610> kind<00:01:48.789> of

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
my hand and I'm saying is I'm kind of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:15.949 
my hand and I'm saying is I'm kind of
bouncing<00:01:49.299> back<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.630> forth<00:01:49.689> so<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.530> have

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:33.370 

let's<00:02:16.959> put<00:02:17.079> them<00:02:17.140> together

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.570 

the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.490 

okay<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.240> probably<00:02:43.510> noticed<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.170> thumb

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
okay so you probably noticed the thumb

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.880 
okay so you probably noticed the thumb
was<00:02:44.530> walking<00:02:45.220> down<00:02:45.400> from

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
was walking down from

00:02:47.890 --> 00:03:02.950 

basically<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:49.000> here

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.160 

okay<00:03:03.530> now<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.370> make<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> Mon<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.270> know<00:03:05.480> which

and sometimes I like to walk up
chromatically<00:04:50.080> just<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.770> still<00:04:51.009> give<00:04:51.189> that

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
chromatically just to still give that

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.149 
chromatically just to still give that
it's<00:04:51.939> an<00:04:52.180> octave<00:04:52.719> line<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.439> really<00:04:53.860> is

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
it's an octave line that really is

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.670 
it's an octave line that really is
distinctive<00:04:54.819> of<00:04:54.969> that<00:04:55.150> style<00:04:55.449> so<00:04:56.349> instead<00:04:56.560> of

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
distinctive of that style so instead of

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.559 
distinctive of that style so instead of
walking<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:57.039> down<00:04:57.279> I<00:04:57.639> like<00:04:57.819> to<00:04:57.969> experiment<00:04:58.300> by

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
walking it down I like to experiment by

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.119 
walking it down I like to experiment by
walking<00:04:59.050> up<00:04:59.199> it<00:04:59.349> kind<00:04:59.650> of<00:04:59.710> brings<00:04:59.860> more

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:00.129 
walking up it kind of brings more

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.580 
walking up it kind of brings more
attention<00:05:00.189> and<00:05:00.669> clashing<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.300> little<00:05:01.539> bit<00:05:01.659> so

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
attention and clashing a little bit so

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.629 
attention and clashing a little bit so
you<00:05:02.680> just<00:05:02.710> kind<00:05:02.919> of<00:05:03.009> have<00:05:03.069> to<00:05:03.219> fight<00:05:03.460> through

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
you just kind of have to fight through

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:16.950 
you just kind of have to fight through
that<00:05:03.729> this<00:05:04.090> n<00:05:04.330> see<00:05:04.539> if<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:04.659> like<00:05:04.810> it

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.210 

okay<00:05:17.960> sometimes<00:05:18.379> you<00:05:18.500> notice<00:05:18.770> I<00:05:18.860> jumped<00:05:19.159> a

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
okay sometimes you notice I jumped a

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.369 
okay sometimes you notice I jumped a
little<00:05:19.250> bit<00:05:19.550> higher<00:05:19.759> so<00:05:19.789> here<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.360> started<00:05:20.870> on

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:21.379 
little bit higher so here I started on

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.830 
little bit higher so here I started on
the<00:05:21.560> B<00:05:21.710> flat<00:05:21.909> to<00:05:22.909> the<00:05:22.939> B<00:05:23.180> natural<00:05:23.449> which

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
the B flat to the B natural which

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.589 
the B flat to the B natural which
totally<00:05:24.379> clashes<00:05:24.590> by<00:05:24.949> 11<00:05:25.340> 11<00:05:25.699> then<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:26.449> get<00:05:26.569> to

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
totally clashes by 11 11 then I get to

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.330 
totally clashes by 11 11 then I get to
the<00:05:26.780> B<00:05:26.930> flat

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
the B flat

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.840 
the B flat
and<00:05:28.520> i<00:05:28.580> went<00:05:28.730> up<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:29.620> D<00:05:30.620> flat<00:05:30.889> which<00:05:31.550> kind<00:05:31.790> of

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
and i went up to D flat which kind of

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.350 
and i went up to D flat which kind of
turns<00:05:32.060> out<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.389> flat<00:05:32.780> into<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.169> dominant<00:05:33.770> 7<00:05:34.070> chord

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
turns out a flat into a dominant 7 chord

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.810 
turns out a flat into a dominant 7 chord
but<00:05:35.360> instead<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.750> going<00:05:36.110> on<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.620> minor<00:05:37.430> 7

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
but instead of going on the a minor 7

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.320 
but instead of going on the a minor 7
flat<00:05:37.850> 5<00:05:38.060> instead<00:05:38.479> of<00:05:38.600> everybody<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:40.490> D<00:05:41.000> flat

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
flat 5 instead of everybody this D flat

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.840 
flat 5 instead of everybody this D flat
is<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.990> part<00:05:42.650> of<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.800> cord<00:05:43.100> so<00:05:43.370> that's<00:05:43.699> why<00:05:43.820> I

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
is the part of the cord so that's why I

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.790 
is the part of the cord so that's why I
chose<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.360> jump<00:05:44.600> up<00:05:44.720> today<00:05:46.660> on<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.870> D<00:05:48.110> I<00:05:48.470> played

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
chose to jump up today on the D I played

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.670 
chose to jump up today on the D I played
the<00:05:48.949> liner<00:05:49.720> so<00:05:50.720> playing<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.050> F<00:05:51.199> makes<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.590> the

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
the liner so playing the F makes it the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.890 
the liner so playing the F makes it the
minor<00:05:51.889> then<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:52.160> went<00:05:52.370> up<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.729> F<00:05:52.970> sharp<00:05:53.600> to

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
minor then I went up to the F sharp to

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:30.730 
minor then I went up to the F sharp to
make<00:05:54.050> it<00:05:54.199> major<00:05:55.600> and<00:05:56.600> I'm<00:05:56.720> back<00:05:57.229> home<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.919> G

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.870 

that's<00:06:31.740> kind<00:06:31.979> of<00:06:32.039> how<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.160> play<00:06:32.400> the<00:06:32.430> Latin

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
that's kind of how you play the Latin

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:44.409 
that's kind of how you play the Latin
feel<00:06:33.060> again<00:06:33.330> getting<00:06:33.539> that<00:06:33.690> baseline<00:06:34.199> down

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:57.280 

putting<00:06:45.419> it<00:06:45.509> all<00:06:45.630> together

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.710 

and<00:06:58.290> that's<00:06:58.920> how<00:06:59.040> you<00:06:59.160> make<00:06:59.790> the<00:06:59.940> song<00:07:00.150> sound

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
and that's how you make the song sound

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.110 
and that's how you make the song sound
Latin
