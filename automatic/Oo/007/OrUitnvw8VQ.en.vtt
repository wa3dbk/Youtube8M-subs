 site creation area that owns 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.039
 by your agency word converter 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.529
 marketing and hans

 and so attention to the screens friends 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.449
 hello with you vitali flounder 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.759
 today we'll talk about adaptive 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 design what is it like this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 implemented on sites like this helps 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.250
 achieve high conversions on mobile 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 devices consider one of the sites with 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.500
 who I had to work it 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.660
 online store that was originally 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 made not in responsive design 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.809
 here you see him as he is 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.390
 looks on large monitors on large 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.969
 screen sizes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.940
 if we consider this site on the screen 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 laptop small screen it will not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.259
 fit full width 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 it will be like this if we consider 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.580
 its on the tablet on ipad the same 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 he will be like that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 fit full width 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 formally it is not such a big problem 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 because man on ipad he can 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 scroll he can scroll the page 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.240
 in all directions therefore big 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.909
 The problem does not cause however if 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.520
 man will look at the site on the smartphone 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.539
 will go to the site on the smartphone he sees here 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.409
 such a picture 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:42.119
 it is not exactly what is meant 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.179
 of course it was not necessary to pronounce either 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.390
 words if he will open on this smartphone 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.610
 the site then he will see just such a picture 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.100
 the key problem is very important and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.240
 that the text will have to read him like this 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 way for example here 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.979
 carried the courier here's a shop so 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.659
 so so so so 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.060
 scroll back to read the following 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.830
 scroll line flipped back 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.420
 scroll scroll back 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.420
 scroll back realist and so 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.820
 further long texts long headers 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.769
 read very uncomfortable on the screen 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.609
 the smartphone has to constantly scroll 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.609
 back and forth 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.640
 This problem is the key is not adaptive 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 design 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.200
 maybe many of you will say that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.750
 responsive design doesn't need that people with 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.010
 smartphones and tablets virtually no 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.060
 visit their website and therefore 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 invest in responsive design not 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.550
 need for this site i will look at 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.550
 technology metric mobile 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.400
 device here you can see 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.810
 share of users who go to 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.570
 mobile site for this 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.560
 site it is 17 point forty five 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.280
 hundredths of a percent almost 18 percent 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.220
 People come from the main apple devices 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.080
 ipad mostly tablets 37 percent and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.080
 iphone 13 percent respectively 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.850
 for this particular site these 17 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.210
 and a half percent make up more 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.790
 120 people per day, that is 120 people 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.230
 Every day, go to this site with 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.170
 tablet or smartphone 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:26.350
 and it is very important for them to get rid of such 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.330
 problems site somewhere else not only on this 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.250
 page such a problem is observed on 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.670
 observed in goods observed in 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.000
 product catalog in search and 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.450
 directly affects the usability of the site 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.750
 for users in respectively 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.220
 purchase conversion in order to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.620
 fix it we are by three design whether the site 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.540
 you made it responsive to look 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.390
 carefully as it happens like this 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.489
 The site is displayed on the big screen if 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.250
 we squeeze it a bit to some 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.250
 of a certain moment to reorganize here 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.980
 he has a little bit of mobile reorganization 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.930
 tablets under the tap with a small 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.870
 by permission 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.480
 rebuild yet he rebuild stronger 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.250
 This is already under the tablet so it looks like 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.250
 ipad in this way 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.880
 squeeze even harder 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.710
 and see how it looks on the smartphone 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.710
 That's how it looks on a smartphone
