so<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.080> only<00:01:48.200> other<00:01:48.470> way<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.650> can<00:01:48.830> do<00:01:48.980> it<00:01:49.130> is

so the only other way you can do it is

so the only other way you can do it is
by<00:01:49.340> putting<00:01:49.550> your<00:01:49.670> hand<00:01:49.970> all<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.360> way<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.660> in

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.950 

the<00:02:03.750> adjuster<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.830> so<00:02:05.189> tight<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> really

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the adjuster was so tight that I really

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.529 
the adjuster was so tight that I really
had<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> display<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.860> crank<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.280> crank<00:02:08.539> until

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
had to display the crank and crank until

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.600 
had to display the crank and crank until
it<00:02:09.660> finally<00:02:10.140> broke<00:02:10.440> loose<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.459> now

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it finally broke loose and is now

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
it finally broke loose and is now
adjusting<00:02:12.390> properly<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.200> I've<00:02:13.950> got<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
adjusting properly so I've got the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.460 
adjusting properly so I've got the
rebound<00:02:14.550> rested<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> way<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.520> is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
rebound rested all the way out so it is

shock<00:02:35.910> will<00:02:36.090> compress<00:02:37.610> it's<00:02:38.610> fastest<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
shock will compress it's fastest the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.449 
shock will compress it's fastest the
least<00:02:41.069> amount<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.370> force<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.380> then<00:02:44.370> I

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
least amount of force so and then I

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.070 
least amount of force so and then I
think<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> rebound<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.330> all<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.569> way<00:02:45.690> Donald

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
think the rebound is all the way Donald

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.250 
think the rebound is all the way Donald
out<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:46.380> well<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.920> that's<00:02:47.100> that's<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.549> you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
out as well and that's that's how you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.080 
out as well and that's that's how you
initially<00:02:49.260> set<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.680> shock<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.310> need<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.940> get

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
initially set up a shock I need to get

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.070 
initially set up a shock I need to get
my<00:02:51.299> my<00:02:52.200> sag<00:02:52.500> set<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.880> feels<00:02:54.180> okay<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.840> doing<00:02:55.019> a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
my my sag set it feels okay just doing a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.840 
my my sag set it feels okay just doing a
bounce<00:02:55.290> test<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:55.920> when<00:02:56.069> my<00:02:56.220> wife<00:02:56.400> comes<00:02:56.670> out

bounce test but when my wife comes out

bounce test but when my wife comes out
this<00:02:57.030> weekend<00:02:57.390> I'm<00:02:57.450> gonna<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.810> her<00:02:57.989> actually

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
this weekend I'm gonna have her actually

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.690 
this weekend I'm gonna have her actually
get<00:02:58.440> out<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> measuring<00:02:58.950> tape<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.400> make<00:02:59.519> sure

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
get out the measuring tape and make sure

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.540 
get out the measuring tape and make sure
that<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.090> set<00:03:00.299> up<00:03:00.330> right

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
that it's set up right

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.640 
that it's set up right
basically<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.480> SAG<00:03:03.720> for<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.050> rear<00:03:04.260> should<00:03:04.530> be

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
basically the SAG for the rear should be

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.320 
basically the SAG for the rear should be
around<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:06.090> it's

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.350 

milimeters<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.580> what<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.850> do<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.270> you

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.830 

the<00:03:14.660> grab<00:03:14.900> rail<00:03:15.200> stand<00:03:16.100> behind<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.490> bike

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
the grab rail stand behind the bike

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.360 
the grab rail stand behind the bike
lifts<00:03:17.840> up<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.080> tail<00:03:18.440> until<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.980> shock<00:03:19.190> is

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
lifts up the tail until the shock is

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.459 
lifts up the tail until the shock is
completely

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:20.469 
completely

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.860 
completely
extended<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:21.969> tail<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.359> as<00:03:22.480> high<00:03:22.629> as<00:03:22.719> it's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
extended and the tail is as high as it's

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.509 
extended and the tail is as high as it's
going<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.049> go<00:03:23.200> without<00:03:23.650> lifting<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.069> tire<00:03:24.310> off

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
going to go without lifting the tire off

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.110 
going to go without lifting the tire off
the<00:03:24.549> ground

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
the ground

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.970 
the ground
have<00:03:25.629> somebody<00:03:25.870> measure<00:03:26.260> from<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.650> fixed<00:03:26.680> point

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
have somebody measure from a fixed point

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.629 
have somebody measure from a fixed point
like<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.639> top<00:03:27.849> of<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:28.060> taillights<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:29.769> the

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
like the top of the taillights to the

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.160 
like the top of the taillights to the
top<00:03:30.879> of<00:03:31.239> the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
top of the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.550 
top of the
you're<00:03:33.470> built<00:03:33.740> on<00:03:33.920> two

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
you're built on two

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.980 
you're built on two
and<00:03:35.980> after<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:36.790> let<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.090> go

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
and after that you let it go

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.880 
and after that you let it go
you<00:03:38.470> sit<00:03:38.680> on<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.890> bike<00:03:39.090> bounce<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.360> once<00:03:40.890> pop

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
you sit on the bike bounce at once pop

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.809 
you sit on the bike bounce at once pop
off<00:03:42.130> measure<00:03:42.670> that's<00:03:43.480> your

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
off measure that's your

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.699 
off measure that's your
I<00:03:44.879> think<00:03:45.180> that's<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.780> static<00:03:46.230> sag<00:03:46.469> or

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I think that's the the static sag or

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.910 
I think that's the the static sag or
whatever

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
whatever

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.290 
whatever
not<00:03:48.069> really<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.400> super-important<00:03:49.240> measurement

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
not really a super-important measurement

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.060 
not really a super-important measurement
the<00:03:51.810> important<00:03:52.230> measurement<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.800> when<00:03:52.980> you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
the important measurement is when you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.220 
the important measurement is when you
hop<00:03:53.250> back<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.670> bike<00:03:54.180> bounce<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.780> once<00:03:55.020> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
hop back on the bike bounce it once and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.010 
hop back on the bike bounce it once and
sit<00:03:55.500> on<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.180> put<00:03:57.180> your<00:03:57.300> actual<00:03:57.570> weight<00:03:57.840> on

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
sit on it and put your actual weight on

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.470 
sit on it and put your actual weight on
it<00:03:58.200> that's<00:03:58.470> your<00:03:58.680> actual<00:03:58.860> sag<00:03:59.760> agenda<00:04:00.210> sag

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it that's your actual sag agenda sag

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.020 
it that's your actual sag agenda sag
setting<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.310> want<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:02.790> between

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
setting so you want to just between

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.710 
setting so you want to just between
completely<00:04:03.870> topped<00:04:04.140> out<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.970> your<00:04:05.970> rider<00:04:06.300> sag

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
completely topped out and your rider sag

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.240 
completely topped out and your rider sag
which<00:04:06.990> is<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.290> sitting<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.770> bike<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
which is you sitting on the bike and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.890 
which is you sitting on the bike and
that<00:04:08.880> should<00:04:09.090> be<00:04:09.210> about<00:04:10.400> 25<00:04:11.400> millimeters<00:04:12.360> give

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
that should be about 25 millimeters give

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.280 
that should be about 25 millimeters give
or<00:04:13.050> take<00:04:13.200> five<00:04:13.470> millimeters<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:15.090> 20<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.630> 30<00:04:15.870> is

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
or take five millimeters so 20 to 30 is

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.050 
or take five millimeters so 20 to 30 is
is<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.890> general<00:04:17.840> range<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.700> front

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
is the general range I think the front

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.740 
is the general range I think the front
is<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.360> bit<00:04:21.690> higher<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:22.680> like<00:04:22.920> 25<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.760> 35<00:04:24.270> but

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
is a bit higher it's like 25 to 35 but

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.629 
is a bit higher it's like 25 to 35 but
of<00:04:25.050> course<00:04:25.290> if<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.440> ask<00:04:25.530> ray<00:04:25.890> sirs

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.910 

they'll<00:04:29.090> tell<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.719> the<00:04:30.319> sag<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.919> kind<00:04:31.189> of

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
they'll tell you that the sag is kind of

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.370 
they'll tell you that the sag is kind of
a<00:04:32.300> squirrely<00:04:33.300> thing<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:33.750> different<00:04:33.870> riders

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
a squirrely thing in different riders

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.780 
a squirrely thing in different riders
before<00:04:34.560> different<00:04:35.040> things<00:04:35.220> different<00:04:35.400> likes

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
before different things different likes

before different things different likes
before<00:04:36.000> everything<00:04:36.540> set<00:04:36.750> up<00:04:36.780> so

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
before everything set up so

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.140 
before everything set up so
it's<00:04:39.350> just<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.620> good<00:04:39.770> baseline<00:04:40.190> start<00:04:40.700> ad<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:41.060> be

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
it's just a good baseline start ad to be

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.980 
it's just a good baseline start ad to be
25<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.840> 30<00:04:42.050> millimeters

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.499

I'm going to get over a few different

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
emergency braking I saw a video the

people<00:05:11.680> who<00:05:11.770> are<00:05:11.890> still<00:05:12.070> confused<00:05:12.640> so<00:05:12.940> I'm

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
people who are still confused so I'm

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.690 
people who are still confused so I'm
going<00:05:13.360> to

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.370 

a<00:05:15.760> semi<00:05:16.600> scientific<00:05:17.320> explanation

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
countersteering can actually show all

countersteering can actually show all
the<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.860> different<00:05:24.220> steps

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
the the different steps

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.860 
the the different steps
from<00:05:26.570> stop<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:28.030> going<00:05:29.030> say<00:05:29.270> illegal<00:05:29.510> speed

from<00:05:35.030> steering<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.840> motorcycle<00:05:36.669> tipping<00:05:37.669> the

from steering the motorcycle tipping the

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.340 
from steering the motorcycle tipping the
front<00:05:38.030> tire<00:05:38.360> in<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.690> direction<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.110> want<00:05:39.139> to

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
front tire in the direction you want to

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.610 
front tire in the direction you want to
go<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.650> actually<00:05:40.280> counter<00:05:40.610> steering<00:05:40.850> so

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
go to actually counter steering so

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.280 
go to actually counter steering so
there'd<00:05:42.620> be<00:05:42.680> good<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.949> get<00:05:43.040> out<00:05:43.160> of<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.310> way

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
there'd be good to get out of the way

there'd be good to get out of the way

passed away a year ago on New Year's Day
from<00:06:17.300> cancer<00:06:17.720> so<00:06:18.290> the<00:06:18.650> holidays<00:06:19.070> really<00:06:19.810> were

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
from cancer so the holidays really were

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.600 
from cancer so the holidays really were
kind<00:06:20.990> of<00:06:21.110> a<00:06:22.540> depressing<00:06:23.540> time<00:06:23.930> for<00:06:24.290> her<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:24.800> I

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
kind of a depressing time for her and I

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.770 
kind of a depressing time for her and I
just<00:06:25.639> wanted<00:06:25.970> to<00:06:26.030> do<00:06:26.120> everything<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.570> could<00:06:26.630> to

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
just wanted to do everything I could to

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.990 
just wanted to do everything I could to
support<00:06:26.990> her

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
support her

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.090

man<00:06:28.570> I<00:06:28.720> was<00:06:28.840> out<00:06:28.990> in<00:06:29.050> Ohio<00:06:29.170> away<00:06:29.650> from<00:06:29.800> the<00:06:29.920> bike

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
man I was out in Ohio away from the bike

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.920 
man I was out in Ohio away from the bike
so<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.520> wouldn't<00:06:31.180> make<00:06:31.270> much<00:06:31.360> sense<00:06:31.720> to<00:06:31.840> be

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
so it wouldn't make much sense to be

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.300 
so it wouldn't make much sense to be
doing<00:06:32.170> videos<00:06:34.050> so<00:06:35.970> that<00:06:36.970> out<00:06:37.150> of<00:06:37.240> the<00:06:37.300> way

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
doing videos so that out of the way

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.050 
doing videos so that out of the way
hopefully<00:06:39.310> there<00:06:39.580> won't<00:06:39.670> be<00:06:39.760> a<00:06:39.820> ton<00:06:40.030> of

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
hopefully there won't be a ton of

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.640 
hopefully there won't be a ton of
traffic<00:06:40.270> on<00:06:40.570> Falls<00:06:40.810> Road<00:06:41.110> so<00:06:41.290> I<00:06:41.350> can<00:06:41.470> actually

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
traffic on Falls Road so I can actually

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.700 
traffic on Falls Road so I can actually
go<00:06:42.040> a<00:06:42.070> decent<00:06:42.490> clip<00:06:42.700> and<00:06:44.310> have<00:06:45.310> some<00:06:45.520> fun
