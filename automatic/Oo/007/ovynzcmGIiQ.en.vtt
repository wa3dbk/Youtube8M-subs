00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello welcome another new video what 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.990
 they saw in the title trick paintings 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.150
 hidden and blocked in large cars 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.500
 line ok then let's start with the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.750
 video since it's a pretty trick 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.820
 simple and that a lot of people maybe 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.949
 I asked how it could be done or if 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.019
 It could not be done and today I bring you the 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.580
 answer to those people not to who does not 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.800
 it has happened that he has a colored paint 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.300
 mate that mate is like no 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 shines so much it was compared to the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.050
 metal that for example I now 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.369
 I bring a matte paint in this environment 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.670
 there is not just you what 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.790
 they wanted to do was to put one to say it 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.920
 so one to that one face mate where it does not 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.650
 I could today I bring you the solution and 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.790
 it's pretty easy to perform ok do not know 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 worry that here I bring you the 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.690
 solution and the first thing that we will have to 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.130
 perform obviously will prepare the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.470
 vehicle and here we have to 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.240
 direct us to the part of repainting and 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.100
 here as you see there is no main color 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.740
 we are going to put you insane to choose a 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.480
 mate suppose I want I do not know is that the 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.340
 White is the one you look better but 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.620
 look here like 20 new several mates 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.239
 I do not know I want a yellow but 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.040
 at the time of putting the pearl as 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.310
 come tell us how sorry your vehicle 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.840
 you need to have a metallic paint ok and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.840
 this works with all the paintings 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.990
 classic chrome-plated metal and with 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.000
 metal is whatever color they want 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.560
 will serve them ok once they have 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.060
 done that because it is in its color 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.070
 matte selected they return it to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.619
 select so that nothing happens and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.420
 can perform the trick ok we left 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.790
 from here we're going to go to the paintings of 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.270
 metallic ok and good paintings 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.520
 metallic and here only because and we're going to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.080
 get off we're going to get out of here and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 Now what we have to do will be 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.420
 go to the part of what you are doing 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.460
 the lights not then here we are going to give you 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.740
 in lights and we're going to have to change 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.080
 lights ok once done this let's 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.080
 to repaint and here we are going to go 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.750
 to main color what is here now 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.970
 we will go to pearl and see this thing 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.310
 so amazing that we can put him 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.319
 pearly to any type of paint 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.569
 ok here as you see there are no ones that do not 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.979
 They look pretty but with as you can see 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.050
 ones that look pretty, that's why we 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.550
 I wanted to choose both yellow because 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.920
 in the yellow I was not going 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.050
 a long time ago, as you see, it changes very little 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.180
 the color since it is a matte paint and since 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.950
 and as you know the matte paint does not 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.930
 tend to shine so much and that's why I do not know 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.700
 note in both the pearly and I think 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.290
 that's why they do not have them ok then 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 that can be done with anyone what 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.310
 let's go back to do so for the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.530
 that they have not understood and we are going to go to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.510
 the metal part is ok here as well 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.220
 we have the pure gold painting and the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.010
 polished gold ok I do not know why strange 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.590
 reason some would want pure gold with 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.600
 green or orange ok just the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.310
 we select the same process I know that 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.650
 I'm spending money on the way but it's 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.840
 for you spent all the money that is 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.760
 necessary in large out line or for 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.350
 that have the best videos now a 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.080
 Once they have selected we will go to 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.240
 the metallic part of paintings and here 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.280
 we just limp we see the paintings 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.920
 they say nothing this girl I do not like is 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.900
 well it's not good and from here we'll go 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.030
 to the main menu not to say it of 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.190
 some way and we'll go to the part of 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.080
 I use key here we just change it 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.180
 the lights and now what we will have to 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.610
 make will enter the repainted color 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.410
 main and pearly ok as you will see another 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.690
 Once we can change it and as you can see we have 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.010
 the golden painting with any pearl 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.810
 you want me to know that this is something 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.630
 of the weirdest and I think it's something that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.760
 it's pretty good ok I just wanted to 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.170
 bring this video because later I'm going 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.670
 to make more color combinations 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.620
 but there are color combinations 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.930
 quite strange that I want to teach you 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.610
 and I wanted to show you how you can 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.980
 combine not for when they do not understand me 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.900
 How do I make the combination? 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.630
 in the description how it can be done and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.130
 it is basically the reason the number 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.160
 two why I wanted to have them ok here 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.260
 As you can see, we have a gold with green that 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.610
 It looks pretty strange but it costs something 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.440
 I wanted to bring them then I hope they 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.660
 have liked look how nice this looks 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.730
 golden green lime with gold I know 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.590
 that are pearly pretty strange and 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.000
 we're just going to leave it like that and 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.290
 I hope you liked today's video 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.970
 you tell me what do you think about this 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.740
 trick in the comments I know it's a 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.390
 trick pretty good since a lot of people 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.920
 I wanted this trick because they told me hey 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.960
 because I can not put a load of 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.940
 a metal painting then here is the 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.770
 solution I say that it looks ugly there 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.630
 Sometimes I know very well how lime green 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.730
 with the gold I did not put it on because 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.590
 I like my surroundings in golden color 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.180
