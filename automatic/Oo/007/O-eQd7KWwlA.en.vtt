your high more high-end games your

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.070 
your high more high-end games your
you'll<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:57.340> maybe<00:02:58.340> five<00:02:58.880> frames<00:02:59.299> per<00:02:59.630> second

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080

you'll get maybe five frames per second
um<00:03:00.819> so<00:03:01.819> that's<00:03:02.180> not<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.959> know<00:03:03.010> desirable<00:03:04.450> but

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
um so that's not you know desirable but

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.650 
um so that's not you know desirable but
movies<00:03:05.780> multimedia<00:03:06.680> it's<00:03:07.220> great<00:03:07.610> deal<00:03:07.910> other

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
movies multimedia it's great deal other

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.979 
movies multimedia it's great deal other
downside<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.650> battery<00:03:10.609> life<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.120> just<00:03:11.420> eats

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
downside is battery life this just eats

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.289 
downside is battery life this just eats
up<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.590> battery<00:03:12.920> life<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:14.269> maybe<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:16.310> one

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
up the battery life you get maybe to one

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.750 
up the battery life you get maybe to one
and<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.570> half<00:03:17.600> hours<00:03:18.230> sorry<00:03:18.560> one<00:03:19.190> half<00:03:19.370> hours

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
and a half hours sorry one half hours

out<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.570> know<00:03:20.690> just<00:03:21.320> basic<00:03:21.769> use<00:03:22.100> when

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
out of just you know just basic use when

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.340 
out of just you know just basic use when
you're<00:03:22.519> doing<00:03:22.690> videos<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.900> stuff<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.200> get

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
less than that so you'll want to have

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.319 
less than that so you'll want to have
your<00:03:27.620> power<00:03:27.890> cable<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.760> wherever<00:03:28.970> you
