00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
called a pattern language by Christopher

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.450 
called a pattern language by Christopher
Alexander<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.420> what<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.289> so<00:00:53.559> useful<00:00:53.829> about<00:00:54.430> a

Alexander and what is so useful about a

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
Alexander and what is so useful about a
pattern<00:00:54.820> language<00:00:55.269> is<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:56.199> it<00:00:56.730> identifies

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
pattern language is that it identifies

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.009 
pattern language is that it identifies
253<00:00:59.050> patterns<00:00:59.680> that<00:01:00.609> make<00:01:01.000> people<00:01:01.239> enjoy
