00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.730
 emilio good night hello good night 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:10.370
 thank you goodbye happy in goddess victoria 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.130
 we know how hard it is here against 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.500
 teams that try to defend themselves a lot and 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.380
 I think we open the score so much 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.640
 little but thank God that 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.189
 triumph that is very important for 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.070
 us what impact does it have to return to 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.779
 first place in the league in view of the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.680
 important matches that come in 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.660
 february good is the pressure always from 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.550
 our team always be in the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.860
 first place I think that that's what 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.870
 we work hard for that we fight and 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.809
 we hope in God to keep us there and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.850
 achieve what we want the cup now 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.760
 once they return to glasgow they have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.649
 very flashy matches what do you expect from 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.510
 the semifinal of the league cup against 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.850
 the rangers I think we're going to match 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.160
 match after the cup that is 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.520
 very important the semifinal we hope in 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.219
 god to achieve is the three times championship those two 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.289
 glasses and the league that we dream of 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.729
 dreams that the first day the 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.600
 celtic the first year we were there 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.670
 fighting also against the radio 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 the three tournaments the three cups and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.479
 we will be a god that this year we are given 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.450
 and there we go with the trust in God that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.219
 everything will be fine 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.409
 now also comes a game with a lot 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.119
 history against the inter of Milan that 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.990
 you know about history and how 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.850
 you expect this game well I think the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.250
 of Europe is different from the ones here 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.420
 I think that against the team against 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.009
 of Milan to all the players of the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.369
 celtic that we want to play we know the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.159
 importance that is not only the rival but 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.890
 that we can move to the best 16 of the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.810
 europa league after having 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.670
 hopes of reaching the best 8 a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 the best 4 and that is our goal I 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.750
 I think to go step by step and wait in 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.539
 God who is doing the best way 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.450
 and the fact that the team is making little progress 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.640
 little now sertic is a club with a lot 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.399
 story but how would you describe it to 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.670
 someone who does not know him there is no 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.399
 to live it I think it's something kind of cute 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.349
 what we live here in celtic park the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.179
 hobby of football as they live 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.950
 fans the history that has the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.930
 pressure that is experienced as players who 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.599
 always win I think it's cute and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.420
 I think that people who do not know me 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.450
 I would like you to watch games 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.270

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.190
 pure heart what they do towards 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.920
 asia towards our team and that's what 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.650
 motivates us more to fight ball to ball 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.540
 to give the victory to it and for 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.580
