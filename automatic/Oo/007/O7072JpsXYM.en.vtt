of the Jedi powers there is Jedi
durability<00:04:56.900> which<00:04:57.410> basically<00:04:57.710> means<00:04:58.039> that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
durability which basically means that

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.250 
durability which basically means that
you<00:04:58.460> can't<00:04:58.639> just<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:59.060> know<00:04:59.120> go<00:04:59.600> god<00:04:59.840> mode<00:05:00.110> with

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
you can't just you know go god mode with

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.870 
you can't just you know go god mode with
this<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.680> just<00:05:00.770> use<00:05:01.039> your<00:05:01.280> powers<00:05:01.639> again

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
this and just use your powers again

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.850 
this and just use your powers again
again<00:05:02.120> if<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.330> use<00:05:02.539> one<00:05:03.110> of<00:05:03.229> two<00:05:03.440> of<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.680> jet

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
again if you use one of two of the jet

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.460 
again if you use one of two of the jet
arcs<00:05:04.070> are<00:05:04.250> two<00:05:04.550> Jedi<00:05:04.970> powers<00:05:05.260> sprinting<00:05:06.260> and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
arcs are two Jedi powers sprinting and

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.800 
arcs are two Jedi powers sprinting and
also<00:05:06.860> when<00:05:07.010> we<00:05:07.160> show<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.370> next<00:05:07.610> Jedi<00:05:08.120> deflect

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
also when we show the next Jedi deflect

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.560 
also when we show the next Jedi deflect
then<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.710> wears<00:05:10.460> down<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.820> durability<00:05:11.539> of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
then it wears down the durability of

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.290 
then it wears down the durability of
your<00:05:11.780> lightsabers<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:13.400> recharge<00:05:14.000> the
