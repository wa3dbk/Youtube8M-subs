00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it's a matter of fact right here when he

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.810 
it's a matter of fact right here when he
pulls<00:02:03.800> I'm<00:02:04.800> just<00:02:05.130> relaxing<00:02:05.399> down<00:02:07.729> can<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.900 
pulls I'm just relaxing down can you
relax<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.600> heavier<00:02:10.459> this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.610> so

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
relax you get heavier this is so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.630

counterintuitive<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.709> most<00:02:14.130> people

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
counterintuitive to what most people

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.920 
counterintuitive to what most people
think<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:15.150> when<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.959> comes<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.320> strength<00:02:16.769> and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
think of when it comes to strength and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.880 
think of when it comes to strength and
proper<00:02:18.930> position<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.590> things<00:02:19.739> like<00:02:19.830> that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
proper position and things like that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.100 
proper position and things like that
because<00:02:20.430> most<00:02:20.940> people's<00:02:21.269> concept<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.989> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because most people's concept of this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.540 
because most people's concept of this
whole<00:02:22.320> thing<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.800> even<00:02:23.220> mention<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.489> word
