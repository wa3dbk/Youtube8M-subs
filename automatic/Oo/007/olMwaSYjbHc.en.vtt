00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.230
 tax reduction 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.689
 the automakers have undertaken to reduce 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 their dancers and a little gulp that 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.349
 beginning of 2012 was more than 31 thousand 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.630

 nine hundred and ninety reais cheap 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.600
 In addition, it is possible to finance 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.460
 soft performance 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:46.310
 get lost out of sight that's cool 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.280
 now yes finally with them to the dream 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.490
 of the new car 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.490

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.370
 good if you want the shit to make a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.100
 financing with the entry of 40 per 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.690
 one hundred and sixty already easy installments 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.460
 started wrong and contaminate the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.520
 you will have spent at least 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.170
 50% more of the value of the vehicle and if you 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.340
 can not pay the installments 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 by neighbor neighborhood because if the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.740
 It fits in your pocket, okay? 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.840
 Oh, you know the annual cost for 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.820
 keep a car like this makes a 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.539
 paper bill bread and taking into 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.580
 consideration and ipva insurance obligatory 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.039
 optional insurance cost precession 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.869
 opportunity for tire maintenance and exchange 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.020
 every two years the parking 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.950
 garage fuel beats aircraft 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.380
 fines this from the bar pool 16 thousand reais per 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.159
 year is not yet convinced then 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.369
 come on 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.649
 this wagon is the goal 1.0 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.060
 green ox is only sold here in Brazil 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.130
 because on the lines that is the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.340
 buy this book imported models 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.860
 has 1.6 engine is good and double brakes 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.989
 electric windows abs and air conditioning 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.569
 a car in Brazil with the 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.910
 features more than 37 thousand 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.429
 Real in Argentina that same car 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.560
 imported into Brazil leaves for about 22 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.510
 thousand and five hundred reais and in mexico 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.110
 much farther than Argentina has always 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.870
 incredible 18 thousand five hundred reais 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.060
 including freight taxes understood then 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.550
 I'm going to repeat the car produced in Brazil. 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.530
 and sold for over 37 thousand reais to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.690
 Brazilians travel about 10 thousand 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.970
 kilometers to Mexico paying freight and 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.129
 all import taxes and even 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.110
 so it is sold there for 18 thousand and 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.270
 five hundred reais half price 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.570
 practiced in brazil 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.410
 I'm sad, calm because now that it's going 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.600
 get worse 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.790
 taking the freight sleep for mexico 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.650
 goal 1.6 could be easily 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.910
 understood by 15 thousand Brazilians 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.280
 five hundred reais 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.210
 government will continue to be 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.820
 car manufacturer and its dealers 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.310
 continue to create thousands of jobs 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.350
 would be created and the consumer who 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.540
 no product at a fairer price 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.340
 Do not believe then let's make a 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.930
 small exercise of reverse management of 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.450
 18 thousand and five hundred reais start at 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 goal 1.6 in mexico about three thousand 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.380
 real pertaining to freight 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.240
 moreover 30% against the rate of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.070
 Mexican import we will now use 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.540
 pretty conservative numbers 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.280
 this because the place of resale 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.520
 the concessionaire in Mexico is only 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.840
 10% of the Brazilian automaker's profit is 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.730
 of only 30% 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.100
 this is the maximum value that goal 1.6 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.660
 short to be produced in Brazil - 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.910
 eight thousand and five hundred reais as 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.250
 that same car could be 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.750
 sold at 37 thousand reais 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.360
 even considering government taxes 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.130
 of 160 other concessionaires of 100 per 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.760
 cent and in the case of the automaker of 100% 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.530
 we arrive at a logical lower than 34 thousand reais 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.720
 and if we compare with the United States it is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.790
 and you can not compare with him do not you see 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.700
 in those wagons there but we will not 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.950
 a top-of-the-line 1.6 with all items 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.820
 in Brazil you would pay around 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.860
 of 52 thousand reais for this same 52 thousand 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.050
 but in the United States by this 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.910
 same value you would buy a camaro 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.030
 zero kilometer which in turn in the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.209
 Brazil is four times this value 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.800
 I did not say something wrong. 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.650
 it means that my name that I paid in 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.660
 one costume wagon here in Brazil the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.390
 company two cars in mexico one 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.500
 shrimp in the United States can only be 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.010
 suck not 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.210
 it is not possible because it was of whom 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.760
 this guilt for these aberrations 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.380
 happens to be largely the fault of the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.970
 high tax burden imposed by 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.430
 government that with its cascade effects 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.080
 It affects the entire production chain reaching 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.880
 almost 100 percent on the cost of 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.530
 production of automobiles in brazil other 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.600
 part of the fault of the automakers and their 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.370
 resellers who continue to have margins 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.480
 of profit and vacation exchanges 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.340
 even receiving billions 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 which serves only to fill the pocket 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.790
 of the Portuguese 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.980
 after worship another part of this guilt 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.220
 was from banks and funders that 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.470
 consumers and 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.810
 last but not least 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.970
 part of that fault person who accepts 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.380
 pay these absurd values â€‹â€‹the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.560
 functional 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.540
 No, this is not normal, you want to know. 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.420
 better walking or cycling 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.390
 besides helping the environment to health the 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.560
 pocket, thanks, I wish I could do more 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.870

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.600
 cars

 I thought I was going to talk about volkswagen right now. 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.199
 the goal was just an example of everything that was 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.180
 here applies to all other 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.080
 in the country without 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.740
 exception

 wake up
