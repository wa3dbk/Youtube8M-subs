upgradability options as far as your RAM
goes<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> can't<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.950> a

seven<00:01:13.500> hundred<00:01:13.590> dollar<00:01:13.860> budget<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> just

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
seven hundred dollar budget that just

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
seven hundred dollar budget that just
doesn't<00:01:14.970> seem<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.509> feasible<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
doesn't seem really feasible at all so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
doesn't seem really feasible at all so
that<00:01:16.710> should<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.189> fine<00:01:17.340> great<00:01:18.119> board

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
but in the future the motherboard does
have<00:01:48.450> four<00:01:48.659> ram<00:01:48.869> slots<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.590> pick<00:01:49.680> up

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829

relatively cheap price of $55 I thought

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
relatively cheap price of $55 I thought
this<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> great<00:02:00.450> deal<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> great<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.890> this

more<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> say<00:02:10.349> an<00:02:10.679> SSD<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.730> doesn't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
more to say an SSD really just doesn't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.860 
more to say an SSD really just doesn't
seem<00:02:12.150> feasible<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> fifty<00:02:13.080> dollar<00:02:13.110> budget

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
seem feasible with a fifty dollar budget

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.270 
seem feasible with a fifty dollar budget
that<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.230> get<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.409> one<00:02:14.650> terabyte<00:02:14.830> drive

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
that you can get a one terabyte drive

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.460 
that you can get a one terabyte drive
for<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.580> yeah<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.450> 120<00:02:17.140> gigabyte

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
for it yeah you can get a 120 gigabyte

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.680 
for it yeah you can get a 120 gigabyte
SSD<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.459> as<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> standalone<00:02:19.120> drive<00:02:19.480> that

SSD but as a standalone drive that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.600 
SSD but as a standalone drive that
doesn't<00:02:19.959> make<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.110> lot<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.379> sense<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.519> know

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
doesn't make a lot of sense and you know

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.430 
doesn't make a lot of sense and you know
with<00:02:21.790> games<00:02:22.000> coming<00:02:22.239> out<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.510> GTA<00:02:22.900> 5<00:02:23.170> being

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
like 40 gigabytes and then there's DLC

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.770 
like 40 gigabytes and then there's DLC
and<00:02:27.459> all<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.790> stuff<00:02:27.909> it's<00:02:28.330> better<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.690> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
and all that stuff it's better just to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600 
and all that stuff it's better just to
get<00:02:28.930> one<00:02:29.140> terabyte<00:02:29.590> how<00:02:29.769> one<00:02:30.040> terabyte<00:02:30.340> not

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
get one terabyte how one terabyte not

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.759 
get one terabyte how one terabyte not
might<00:02:30.819> not<00:02:30.970> even<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.329> enough<00:02:31.659> but<00:02:32.079> an<00:02:32.200> SSD<00:02:32.620> is

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
might not even be enough but an SSD is

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.440 
might not even be enough but an SSD is
something<00:02:33.159> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.819> future<00:02:34.239> and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
something you can get in the future and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.660 
something you can get in the future and
