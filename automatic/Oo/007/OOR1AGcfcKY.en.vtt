not it's really not I mean the bike
channels<00:00:32.140> better<00:00:32.320> under<00:00:32.529> power<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:34.000> know

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
channels better under power you know

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.820 
channels better under power you know
there's<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.660> lot<00:00:34.930> of<00:00:34.960> really<00:00:35.290> great<00:00:35.410> things

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
there's a lot of really great things

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
of counterintuitive and it really goes a

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.119 
of counterintuitive and it really goes a
long<00:00:41.050> way<00:00:41.199> to<00:00:41.260> make<00:00:41.440> any<00:00:41.559> more<00:00:41.710> comfortable<00:00:42.040> on

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
long way to make any more comfortable on

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.890 
long way to make any more comfortable on
a<00:00:42.159> racetrack<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:42.699> you<00:00:42.760> actually<00:00:43.239> head<00:00:43.510> out<00:00:43.690> I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
a racetrack and you actually head out I

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.450 
a racetrack and you actually head out I
mean<00:00:44.110> there's<00:00:44.440> no<00:00:44.530> doubt<00:00:44.739> by<00:00:45.040> going<00:00:45.309> through

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
mean there's no doubt by going through

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.149 
mean there's no doubt by going through
the<00:00:45.519> school<00:00:45.699> I'm<00:00:45.850> about<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.120> rider<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.960> know

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159
