00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.289
 of spinach 3 chopped tomatoes

 fast they will see 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.059
 the first step of this recipe is to put

 our turkey breast in the oven 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.980
 oven and it is already hot 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.080
 it has to be at a high temperature 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.420
 we are talking about 280 200 grams 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.290
 then we will put some oil 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 olive in the tin 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.740

 turkey sopraval is very tasty so 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.410
 a lot of seasoning does not need 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 at least 50 minutes at an hour already 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.940
 that as I mentioned before 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.340
 meats with bones take longer in 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.340
 trees and now let's make the sauce 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.720
 the ideas tomatoes that when what 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.710
 whoever is with everything with nuggets 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.750
 his juice yes without the skin and everyone is a 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 egg is what we are going to use is that all 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.290
 the juices give an incredible flavor to 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.760
 our sauce 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.700
 we have a hot pan 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.700
 of spinach if you do not have chard spinach 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.290
 and now let's add the tomato 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.560
 spoonful of flour that what this does 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.900
 we will adjust the sauce add 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.750
 the cream 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.700
 then now 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.520
 of being them they will think why 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.520
 yogurt gives it a very special acidity 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.680
 curry because not always one in the house 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.750

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.859
 totally absent of trans fats and very 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.400
