00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:58.429 
Argos so what you need to do here is go
to<00:06:53.999> the<00:06:54.389> right<00:06:56.779> so<00:06:57.779> it's<00:06:57.900> up<00:06:58.020> there<00:06:58.139> ahead<00:06:58.319> of

00:06:58.429 --> 00:06:58.439 
to the right so it's up there ahead of

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:02.620 
to the right so it's up there ahead of
me

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.500 

and<00:07:02.780> some<00:07:03.500> reason<00:07:03.800> I<00:07:03.950> can't<00:07:04.010> soak<00:07:04.700> up<00:07:04.730> water<00:07:05.150> in

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
and some reason I can't soak up water in

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:11.500 
and some reason I can't soak up water in
the<00:07:05.690> middle<00:07:05.960> of<00:07:06.110> a<00:07:09.430> cocoon<00:07:10.430> here<00:07:10.910> so<00:07:11.240> we<00:07:11.390> have

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
the middle of a cocoon here so we have

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.730 
the middle of a cocoon here so we have
to<00:07:11.630> go<00:07:11.750> over<00:07:11.780> and<00:07:12.020> actually<00:07:12.260> suck<00:07:12.500> it<00:07:12.620> out<00:07:12.680> of

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
to go over and actually suck it out of

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.160 
to go over and actually suck it out of
the<00:07:12.920> waterfall<00:07:13.520> and<00:07:14.180> then<00:07:14.750> there's<00:07:15.020> the

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
the waterfall and then there's the

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.720 
the waterfall and then there's the
hydroplane<00:07:15.800> so<00:07:16.730> there<00:07:16.850> we<00:07:16.940> got<00:07:17.030> the<00:07:17.150> water<00:07:18.730> and

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
hydroplane so there we got the water and

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:25.120 
hydroplane so there we got the water and
now<00:07:19.880> we<00:07:19.940> want<00:07:20.270> you<00:07:20.510> okay<00:07:21.470> enough<00:07:21.620> jump<00:07:21.890> up<00:07:24.130> and

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.130 
now we want you okay enough jump up and

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.840 
now we want you okay enough jump up and
there<00:07:25.790> it<00:07:25.880> is<00:07:27.070> and<00:07:28.070> now<00:07:28.160> just<00:07:28.460> head<00:07:28.640> back<00:07:28.670> to

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:28.850 
there it is and now just head back to

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.490 
there it is and now just head back to
the<00:07:29.090> ship<00:07:29.150> and<00:07:29.360> take<00:07:29.720> off<00:07:29.960> and<00:07:30.230> we're<00:07:30.320> going<00:07:30.440> to

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
the ship and take off and we're going to

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.470 
the ship and take off and we're going to
go<00:07:30.590> back<00:07:30.800> and<00:07:30.830> we're<00:07:31.100> going<00:07:31.250> to<00:07:31.280> tell<00:07:31.490> dr.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:32.480 
go back and we're going to tell dr.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.360 
go back and we're going to tell dr.
