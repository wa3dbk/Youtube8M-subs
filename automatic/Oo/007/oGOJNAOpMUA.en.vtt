00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.879
 so I'll finish this chapter by 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.470
 the notion of root umpteenth this time 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.240
 in the complex any one did it 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.620
 for unity we even know the whole 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 solutions now to be done for a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 name of any complex so we 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.400
 let's solve the isabelle equation 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:27.539
 also then against here alpha that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:30.619
 is going to be a big complex in the new 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.619
 complex our streets 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:39.149
 I will take 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 ro for the alpha and beta module which 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.950
 will be an argument because of hunger 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.520
 precisely i'm going to write alpha under the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.629
 good exponential form quit not I 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 still passed by the mutation 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.940
 exponentially it's going to be a lot more 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.059
 flexible ok I want to solve this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.059
 equation 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.120
 I'm going to ask you do not need a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 alternative z06 ghana i will do in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080
 so in fact that 0 is a solution of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
 this equation 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.180
 then we will take roots here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.810
 eighth of euros exponential was there 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.939
 parked in fact we have here z0 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.520
 powerful scene that gives me red 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.430
 exponential and state if you put to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.409
 her power she I was good roots 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.979
 state council in other words naf 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.530
 fortunately 17.0 and well a solution 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.409
 to yield 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 it will help us so that means that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.649
 solve the equation is rigal alpha 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 that which is worth solving za does not equal and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.490
 well 0 power penalty since zev zero 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.130
 is a solution of this equation 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 but that's equivalent to solving that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.070
 it's no he we agree 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.350
 if our alpha go out completely 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.830
 naked so finally here write his sentences on 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.120
 zen you are europe licensed and airlock 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.989
 had taken 20 woods property on 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.060
 powers that which means that z on 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.709
 z 0 all at power n is hardly 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.019
 delay lately since we know how to solve 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.489
 this kind of equations a certain numbers 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.720
 complex to the senegal power a 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.010
 network gig since these are the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.650
 simply umpteenth roots of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.709
 unity by contrition will transform 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.060
 have vaporized this premium gazelles 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.820
 out of two is better 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.040
 so that will solve z prime 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.400
 power n equals 1 so that means 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.329
 that solve this equation 5 see there the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.190
 others this one is supposed to solve that 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.160
 means that all 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.540
 solutions of the Senegalese equation alpha 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.829
 are the 0 exponential zee helps 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.820
 8000 cap and a lot of fun and 0 on 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.820
 aisne for car from zero to oise 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.530
 indeed if this premium and solutions 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 this equation that means that z and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.549
 solution of this equation 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.170
 so far we have an equivalence 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.640
 agrees 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.650
 so if I take again this equality 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.939
 if I have a bonus that 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.810
 powerful and equation in this cap z which 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.209
 is equal to zero the print and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.379
 solution of this equation 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.480
 so it is normal that a set of 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.430
 solutions will always include here the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.260
 z0 because at every step I'm going 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.379
 find an umpteenth root of unity 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.819
 for this equation for results 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.329
 initially that of al I must 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.310
 multiplies by seven zero since it will be 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.459
 helpers who wants to give him 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.799
 7-0 times the prices so all the 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.889
 umpteenth roots of the unity of this 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.900
 equation will be multiplied by 0 for 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.159
 to be solution of this equation because 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.459
 that it's this equation content on 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:14.510
 speak here with 7 0 who did not dare that's 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.010
 a little ugly anyway credit 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.079
 Swiss was 2-0 there so we go 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.359
 transformed this writing and we're going 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.000
 give definitely all 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.910
 solutions I would say a little more complete 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.220
 since f0 its euros nm roots 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.669
 exponential iteration helps one 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.539
 mix so it will stay us roots 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.949
 nth of euros exponential property 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.930
 on the exponential judge the multiples 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.590
 I add exhibitors I can 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.419
 put is a factor so I'm going to have 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.280
 here y factor 2 then usually the 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.919
 shape we leave it like that you are at 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.060
 suresnes on the one hand more are planned 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.650
 in domains domains went 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:02.919
 no problem so you can be sure 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.919
 she and so for k 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.039
 are we going 0 had less that I believe 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.830
 that it exceeds a little so here it is 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.400
 the set of solutions of this 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.590
 equation 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.680
 so if we have a complex number and he 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.289
 is an algebraic woman in principle he 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.180
 here will have to go in form of the side of 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.789
 our metrics for this notation to the 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.969
 exponential and then apply the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.969
 formula 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.150
 I was not wrong there in bed in 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.590
 would do the problem so here he knows 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.740
 for this chapter on numbers 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.740
 complex
