00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.860 
it when it took off with the arrow so we
really<00:02:37.030> weren't<00:02:37.150> sure<00:02:37.269> what<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.540> going<00:02:37.810> on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
really weren't sure what was going on

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.630 
really weren't sure what was going on
other<00:02:38.080> than<00:02:38.200> these<00:02:38.800> things<00:02:39.010> were<00:02:39.129> causing<00:02:39.519> our

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
other than these things were causing our

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.520 
other than these things were causing our
arrows<00:02:39.970> not<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.330> fly<00:02:40.540> straight

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
arrows not to fly straight

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.110 
arrows not to fly straight
so<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.160> went<00:02:42.460> back<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.760> looked<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.060> an

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
so I went back and looked in an

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.300 
so I went back and looked in an
instruction<00:02:43.570> video<00:02:43.810> again<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.470> figured<00:02:45.160> out

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
instruction video again and figured out

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.130 
instruction video again and figured out
that<00:02:45.610> hey<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.270> order<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.690> get<00:02:46.810> these<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.110> work

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
that hey in order to get these to work

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.050 
that hey in order to get these to work
they're<00:02:47.650> recommending<00:02:48.280> using<00:02:48.460> that<00:02:48.790> arrow

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
they're recommending using that arrow

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.020 
they're recommending using that arrow
with<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.360> four<00:02:49.720> feathers<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> went

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
with the four feathers on it so I went

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.680 
with the four feathers on it so I went
to<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.240> Magnus<00:02:52.600> website<00:02:53.130> found<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.220> link

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to the Magnus website found the link

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
to the Magnus website found the link
bought<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:55.990> these<00:02:56.050> arrows<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
bought some of these arrows for the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.160 
bought some of these arrows for the
poundage<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.310> my<00:02:57.490> bow<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.810> went<00:02:58.990> ahead<00:02:59.080> and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
poundage of my bow and I went ahead and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.660 
poundage of my bow and I went ahead and
bought<00:02:59.350> some<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.650> these<00:02:59.860> little<00:03:00.160> quiver

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
bought some of these little quiver

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.900 
bought some of these little quiver
adapters<00:03:01.540> as<00:03:01.720> well<00:03:02.560> because<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.670> things

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
adapters as well because these things

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.640 
adapters as well because these things
here<00:03:04.240> did<00:03:04.450> not<00:03:04.480> fit<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.959> my<00:03:05.050> quiver<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
here did not fit in my quiver and the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.770 
here did not fit in my quiver and the
blades<00:03:05.890> end<00:03:06.130> up<00:03:06.220> sticking<00:03:06.430> out<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.420> basically

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
blades end up sticking out and basically

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.380 
blades end up sticking out and basically
what<00:03:08.020> these<00:03:08.140> are<00:03:08.350> supposed<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.680> do<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.640> you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
what these are supposed to do is you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.920 
what these are supposed to do is you
stick<00:03:10.600> them<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.840> your<00:03:10.930> quiver<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.430> and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
stick them in your quiver like so and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.140 
stick them in your quiver like so and
then<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.470> turkey<00:03:14.830> tip<00:03:15.040> goes<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:15.940> here<00:03:16.120> like

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
then your turkey tip goes in here like

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.240 
then your turkey tip goes in here like
that<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.560> gives<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:18.010> bit<00:03:18.130> more

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
that so it gives you a little bit more

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.740 
that so it gives you a little bit more
protection<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:18.940> don't<00:03:19.120> cut<00:03:19.330> yourself<00:03:20.700> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
protection so you don't cut yourself so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.790 
protection so you don't cut yourself so

no problem and then I will shoot my
normal<00:04:35.169> arrow<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:36.000> with<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:38.110> turkey<00:04:38.470> tip

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
normal arrow here with the turkey tip

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.580 
normal arrow here with the turkey tip
and<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.400> shoots<00:04:39.669> about<00:04:39.960> six<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.110> eight<00:04:41.260> inches

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
and it shoots about six to eight inches

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.450 
and it shoots about six to eight inches
to<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.890> left<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:44.010> then<00:04:45.010> once<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.550> used<00:04:46.060> the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
to the left and then once I used the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.980 
to the left and then once I used the
four<00:04:48.460> feathered<00:04:49.000> arrows<00:04:49.330> here<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.840> was

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
four feathered arrows here that was

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.810 
four feathered arrows here that was
recommended<00:04:50.320> kind<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.979> in<00:04:51.160> between<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.580> lines

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
recommended kind of in between the lines

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.420 
recommended kind of in between the lines
in<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.840> instructional<00:04:53.440> video

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
in the instructional video

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.550 
in the instructional video
the<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:55.270> grouping<00:04:55.630> got<00:04:55.780> really<00:04:56.050> good<00:04:56.229> it<00:04:56.410> only

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
the the grouping got really good it only

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.310 
the the grouping got really good it only
dropped<00:04:56.889> a<00:04:57.010> couple<00:04:57.220> of<00:04:57.370> inches<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.940> I<00:04:58.600> suspect

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
dropped a couple of inches and I suspect

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.140 
dropped a couple of inches and I suspect
it<00:04:59.470> was<00:04:59.560> dropping<00:05:00.040> because<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.639> my<00:05:00.820> capture

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
it was dropping because of my capture

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.020 
it was dropping because of my capture
arrest<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:03.060> in<00:05:04.060> short<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:05.190> don't<00:05:06.190> think<00:05:06.669> this<00:05:06.910> is

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
arrest so in short I don't think this is

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.379 
arrest so in short I don't think this is
going<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.210> add<00:05:07.479> much<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.889> your<00:05:09.060> your<00:05:10.060> hunting

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389

more dollars for the for the arrows

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.610

I<00:05:23.710> went<00:05:23.919> out<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.130> bought<00:05:24.220> another<00:05:24.280> arrest<00:05:24.790> and

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
I went out and bought another arrest and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.170 
I went out and bought another arrest and
looking<00:05:26.410> back<00:05:26.560> I<00:05:26.860> would<00:05:27.100> probably<00:05:27.760> just<00:05:28.000> stick

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
looking back I would probably just stick

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.760 
looking back I would probably just stick
with<00:05:28.330> my<00:05:28.479> broadheads<00:05:28.930> instead<00:05:29.289> of<00:05:29.410> doing<00:05:29.650> this

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
with my broadheads instead of doing this

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.370 
with my broadheads instead of doing this
because<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:31.030> has<00:05:31.090> created<00:05:31.690> more<00:05:31.900> gear<00:05:32.110> for

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
because this has created more gear for

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.430 
because this has created more gear for
me<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.560> carry<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.130> I'm<00:05:33.699> really<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.780> margin

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
me to carry and I'm really the margin

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.920 
me to carry and I'm really the margin
for<00:05:35.470> error<00:05:35.860> isn't<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:37.180> odds<00:05:37.330> are<00:05:37.570> not<00:05:37.660> that

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
for error isn't the odds are not that

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.400 
for error isn't the odds are not that
good<00:05:38.169> I<00:05:38.440> mean<00:05:39.310> that<00:05:40.300> ending<00:05:40.630> crus<00:05:40.840> might<00:05:41.050> kill

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
good I mean that ending crus might kill

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.570 
good I mean that ending crus might kill
zone<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:41.830> well<00:05:42.070> as<00:05:42.310> much<00:05:42.699> as<00:05:42.729> I<00:05:42.940> was<00:05:43.030> hoping

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
zone that well as much as I was hoping

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.490 
zone that well as much as I was hoping
