canister in the evaporator system of the
fuel<00:00:10.320> injection<00:00:10.679> system<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.469> you<00:00:13.469> know<00:00:13.620> what

end<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.730> on<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.940> end<00:00:48.440> there's<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.680> kind<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
end and on this end there's some kind of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
end and on this end there's some kind of
bad<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:52.550> not<00:00:53.550> sure<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.059> got<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.360> energy

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
bad for not sure if I got the energy

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.340 
bad for not sure if I got the energy
that<00:00:55.070> cut<00:00:56.070> through<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.109> there's<00:00:58.109> some

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that cut through that but there's some

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.330 
that cut through that but there's some
kind<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.239> metal<00:01:00.239> cylinder<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.469> love<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
kind of metal cylinder I love this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
kind of metal cylinder I love this
spring-loaded<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.690> let<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:05.360> spring

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
spring-loaded or not let me see spring

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.980 
spring-loaded or not let me see spring
loaded<00:01:08.060> let<00:01:09.060> me<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:09.780> pull<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
loaded let me see if I could pull that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.720 
loaded let me see if I could pull that
out<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.439> there

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.710 

as<00:01:12.910> you<00:01:13.420> can<00:01:13.570> see<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:14.850> piece<00:01:15.850> does<00:01:16.210> come<00:01:16.540> out

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
as you can see this piece does come out

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.350 
as you can see this piece does come out
and<00:01:16.990> there<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.470> spring<00:01:17.770> in<00:01:18.040> there<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:19.090> I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
and there is a spring in there so I

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.480 
and there is a spring in there so I
don't<00:01:20.170> know<00:01:20.410> why<00:01:20.620> this<00:01:20.680> would<00:01:21.010> be<00:01:21.040> spring

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
don't know why this would be spring

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.820 
don't know why this would be spring
loaded<00:01:21.760> but<00:01:22.630> anyway<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:24.070> goes<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.580> like<00:01:24.820> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
loaded but anyway that goes in like that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.340 
loaded but anyway that goes in like that
that<00:01:26.830> goes<00:01:27.100> in<00:01:27.310> like<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.150> I<00:01:28.840> guess<00:01:29.110> these

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
that goes in like that and I guess these

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.370 
that goes in like that and I guess these
granulars<00:01:30.090> fill<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.300> up<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.690> maybe<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.320> has

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
granulars fill it up and maybe it has

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.160 
granulars fill it up and maybe it has
some<00:01:32.800> kind<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.300> suction<00:01:34.300> or<00:01:34.690> something<00:01:35.050> on

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
some kind of suction or something on

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.800 
some kind of suction or something on
there<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.410> makes<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.730> know<00:01:36.880> go<00:01:37.480> in<00:01:37.660> and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
there that makes it you know go in and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.360 
there that makes it you know go in and
out<00:01:38.130> anyway

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
out anyway

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.910 
out anyway
that's<00:01:39.970> what<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.330> got<00:01:40.510> there<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.620> other

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
that's what you got there this other

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.570 
that's what you got there this other
side<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.430> spring-loaded<00:01:42.700> as<00:01:43.150> well<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:44.580> there

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
side is spring-loaded as well so there

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.670 
side is spring-loaded as well so there
goes<00:01:45.760> your<00:01:45.790> treat<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.630> baffle<00:01:47.110> system<00:01:47.260> cut

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
goes your treat the baffle system cut

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.580 
goes your treat the baffle system cut
open<00:01:48.070> if<00:01:48.910> you<00:01:49.180> don't<00:01:49.360> see<00:01:49.540> any<00:01:49.720> videos<00:01:50.110> from<00:01:50.380> me

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
open if you don't see any videos from me

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.460 
open if you don't see any videos from me
from<00:01:51.160> now<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:51.880> know<00:01:52.000> I've<00:01:52.210> developed<00:01:53.080> some

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
from now on you know I've developed some

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.730 
from now on you know I've developed some
kind<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:54.030> illness<00:01:55.030> from<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.690> poisons<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.710> I

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
kind of illness from the poisons that I

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.550 
kind of illness from the poisons that I
got<00:01:57.100> from<00:01:57.400> opening<00:01:57.940> up<00:01:58.120> this<00:01:58.330> thing<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.960> it

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
got from opening up this thing and it

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.660 
got from opening up this thing and it
was<00:01:59.680> nice<00:02:00.010> knowing<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.400> guys

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
was nice knowing you guys

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.120 
was nice knowing you guys
other<00:02:01.450> than<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.720> I'll<00:02:02.080> be<00:02:02.350> back<00:02:02.560> in<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.830> day<00:02:03.010> or

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
other than that I'll be back in a day or

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.230 
other than that I'll be back in a day or
two<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.460> another<00:02:03.730> video<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:05.910> have<00:02:06.910> seen<00:02:07.210> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
two with another video I have seen a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.380 
two with another video I have seen a
video<00:02:07.720> where<00:02:08.200> someone<00:02:08.230> was<00:02:08.920> dumping<00:02:09.520> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
video where someone was dumping the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.490 
video where someone was dumping the
granulars<00:02:11.050> out<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.280> tubes<00:02:12.550> on<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.210> I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
granulars out of the tubes on the in I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.650 
granulars out of the tubes on the in I
guess<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.650> only<00:02:14.800> way<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.310> can<00:02:15.490> happen<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:16.120> if

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
guess the only way that can happen is if

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.210 
guess the only way that can happen is if
the<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:18.550> gasket<00:02:19.180> material<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.959> there<00:02:20.230> has

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the little gasket material in there has
