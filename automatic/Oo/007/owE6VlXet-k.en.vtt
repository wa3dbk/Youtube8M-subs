and reading was just pretty peachy
really<00:04:28.789> I<00:04:29.000> mean<00:04:29.330> we<00:04:29.600> I'll<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.710> always<00:04:30.979> say<00:04:31.130> we

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
really I mean we I'll I always say we

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.180 
really I mean we I'll I always say we
cuz<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.699> transistor<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:32.449> to<00:04:32.690> say<00:04:32.870> we<00:04:33.050> we<00:04:33.979> grew

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
cuz of transistor so to say we we grew

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.310 
cuz of transistor so to say we we grew
up<00:04:34.340> outside<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.300> running<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.720> little<00:04:35.870> bit<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.289> a

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
up outside of running a little bit on a

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.710 
up outside of running a little bit on a
little<00:04:36.560> bit<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.740> property<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:38.270> we<00:04:38.360> just<00:04:38.539> kind

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
little bit of property and we just kind

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.510 
little bit of property and we just kind
of<00:04:38.780> had<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:38.990> run<00:04:39.229> of<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.710> whole<00:04:39.830> place<00:04:40.130> like

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
of had the run of the whole place like

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.480 
of had the run of the whole place like
oh<00:04:41.110> maybe<00:04:42.110> it's<00:04:42.349> different<00:04:42.710> now<00:04:42.919> than<00:04:43.160> when<00:04:43.430> we

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
oh maybe it's different now than when we

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.010 
oh maybe it's different now than when we
grew<00:04:43.789> up<00:04:43.849> but<00:04:44.120> our<00:04:44.210> parents<00:04:44.389> were<00:04:44.630> just<00:04:44.750> kind

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
grew up but our parents were just kind

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.089 
grew up but our parents were just kind
of<00:04:45.050> like<00:04:45.199> yeah<00:04:45.530> go<00:04:45.830> ahead

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
of like yeah go ahead

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.430 
of like yeah go ahead
my<00:04:46.550> mom<00:04:46.699> has<00:04:46.910> this<00:04:47.030> wicked<00:04:47.330> whistle<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.139> then

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
get back to the house and we had to like

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.920 
get back to the house and we had to like
book<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.460> if<00:04:52.699> we<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.090> kind<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.330> lollygagging

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
book it to if we is kind of lollygagging

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.140 
book it to if we is kind of lollygagging
she<00:04:54.080> was<00:04:54.199> this<00:04:54.440> we<00:04:55.370> had<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.699> church<00:04:55.880> right

be with us we just the three of us just
kind<00:05:10.970> of<00:05:11.060> roamed<00:05:11.330> around<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.810> was<00:05:11.900> great

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
kind of roamed around it was great

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.810 
kind of roamed around it was great
pretty<00:05:12.500> much<00:05:12.620> this<00:05:12.800> is<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.159> this<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.729> the

pretty much this is it this is the
baseball<00:05:14.030> diamond<00:05:14.720> or<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.289> used<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.620> be<00:05:15.740> it's

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
baseball diamond or it used to be it's

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.939 
baseball diamond or it used to be it's
kind<00:05:16.159> of<00:05:16.250> overgrown<00:05:16.550> now<00:05:17.260> if<00:05:18.260> we<00:05:18.590> could<00:05:18.770> get

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
kind of overgrown now if we could get

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.010 
kind of overgrown now if we could get
one<00:05:19.190> more<00:05:19.430> player<00:05:19.789> me<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.449> Rachel<00:05:20.599> then<00:05:20.900> we

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
one more player me and Rachel then we

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.779 
one more player me and Rachel then we
would<00:05:21.169> play<00:05:21.409> three-person<00:05:22.280> baseball<00:05:22.669> with

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
would play three-person baseball with

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.360 
would play three-person baseball with
ghost<00:05:23.030> runners<00:05:23.560> someone<00:05:24.560> would<00:05:24.710> pitch<00:05:24.949> and

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
ghost runners someone would pitch and

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.649 
ghost runners someone would pitch and
then<00:05:25.490> probably<00:05:25.669> go<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.240> way

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
then probably go that way

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.689 
then probably go that way
pitch<00:05:27.380> in<00:05:27.560> then<00:05:27.770> run<00:05:27.979> and<00:05:28.190> then<00:05:28.280> some<00:05:28.460> would<00:05:28.610> be

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
pitch in then run and then some would be

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.339 
pitch in then run and then some would be
over<00:05:28.880> there<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.150> then<00:05:29.240> we<00:05:29.330> had<00:05:29.419> ghosts<00:05:29.630> others

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.170 

sometimes<00:05:33.349> it<00:05:33.470> worked<00:05:33.650> out<00:05:33.800> most<00:05:34.759> of<00:05:34.970> me<00:05:35.090> in

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
sometimes it worked out most of me in

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.749 
sometimes it worked out most of me in
Rachel's<00:05:35.570> games<00:05:35.840> ended<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.500> fights<00:05:36.830> like<00:05:37.400> that

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
Rachel's games ended in fights like that

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.120 
Rachel's games ended in fights like that
