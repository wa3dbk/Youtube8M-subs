devon flyer double O gauge train set now
this<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.490> includes<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.119> small<00:00:21.420> 040<00:00:22.020> door

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this one includes a small 040 door

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.749 
this one includes a small 040 door
industrial<00:00:23.700> shelter<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:25.040> to<00:00:26.040> open<00:00:26.279> wagons

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
industrial shelter and to open wagons

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.710 
industrial shelter and to open wagons
and<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> break<00:00:27.450> then<00:00:27.750> also<00:00:28.649> comes<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:30.419> new

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and a break then also comes with the new

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.000 
and a break then also comes with the new
style<00:00:31.110> analog<00:00:31.680> controller<00:00:32.390> transformer<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
style analog controller transformer and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.890 
style analog controller transformer and
track<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.940> see<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:37.500> makes<00:00:37.820> one

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
track so as you can see it makes one

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.050 
track so as you can see it makes one
kind<00:00:39.900> of<00:00:39.990> oval<00:00:40.500> cross<00:00:41.070> between<00:00:41.310> overlin

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
kind of oval cross between overlin

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.580 
kind of oval cross between overlin
circle<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> I'll<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.320> locos<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
circle so I'll now get to the locos and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.060 
circle so I'll now get to the locos and
what's<00:00:46.740> in<00:00:46.830> it<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.080> should<00:00:49.290> say<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.860> get<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what's in it like I should say so get to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.350 
what's in it like I should say so get to
the<00:00:53.190> logos<00:00:54.560> now<00:00:55.560> this<00:00:56.400> one<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.820> slightly

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the logos now this one is slightly

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.350 
the logos now this one is slightly
better<00:00:57.600> policy<00:00:58.260> than<00:00:58.290> standard<00:00:59.360> industrial

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
better policy than standard industrial

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.620 
better policy than standard industrial
shunters<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:01.050> paint<00:01:01.440> finish<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.950> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.190> nicer

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
shunters the paint finish is a lot nicer

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.450 
shunters the paint finish is a lot nicer
and<00:01:03.630> I<00:01:03.750> find<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> running<00:01:04.320> polities<00:01:04.769> far

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and I find the running polities far

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.000 
and I find the running polities far
better<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> cab<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.520> maybe<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.060> see

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
better to the cab with you maybe I see

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.940 
better to the cab with you maybe I see
because<00:01:11.010> my<00:01:11.159> poor<00:01:11.550> zone<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> cab<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.650> has

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
because my poor zone the cab it has

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
because my poor zone the cab it has
plenty<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> detail<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.330> none<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.200> just

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
plenty of detail and none of it's just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
plenty of detail and none of it's just
painted<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.490> pretty<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:17.940> these

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
painted but that's pretty good for these

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
yeah brass down not really brass but

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.170 
yeah brass down not really brass but

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.340 
also this little pipe at the front that
just<00:01:43.710> fell<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:45.270> fragile<00:01:45.900> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just fell off and the really fragile but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.190 
just fell off and the really fragile but
that's<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> comes<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> pack<00:01:48.780> death

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's then it comes in this pack death

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
that's then it comes in this pack death
a<00:01:49.350> fact<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.830> drivers<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.400> all<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> plastic

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
a fact with drivers and all that plastic

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.580 
a fact with drivers and all that plastic
non<00:01:52.170> sprung<00:01:52.590> buffers<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.840> wide<00:01:54.840> permanent

non sprung buffers and wide permanent

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.000 
non sprung buffers and wide permanent
couplings<00:01:56.510> but<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.960> runs<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.530> well<00:01:58.680> for

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
couplings but it runs really well for

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.760 
couplings but it runs really well for
the<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.340> major<00:01:59.520> house<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.560> see

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
connecting rods instead of just the one

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.160 
connecting rods instead of just the one
along<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:17.909> also<00:02:18.269> has<00:02:18.389> one<00:02:18.540> coming

yeah<00:04:54.219> this<00:04:54.999> is<00:04:55.059> really<00:04:55.330> good<00:04:55.659> start<00:04:55.960> a<00:04:56.110> second

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:56.589 
yeah this is really good start a second

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.559 
yeah this is really good start a second
we<00:04:57.430> got<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.699> to<00:04:57.789> my<00:04:57.909> seven-year-old<00:04:58.389> brother

we got it to my seven-year-old brother

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.119 
we got it to my seven-year-old brother
so<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.289> does<00:05:00.279> what<00:05:00.490> it's<00:05:00.639> good<00:05:01.180> for<00:05:01.259> subset<00:05:02.259> so

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
so it does what it's good for subset so

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.029 
so it does what it's good for subset so
what<00:05:03.550> do<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:03.819> review<00:05:04.180> on<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.419> controller<00:05:05.039> today

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
what do a review on the controller today

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.359 
what do a review on the controller today
but<00:05:06.369> i<00:05:06.399> will<00:05:06.669> do<00:05:06.819> a<00:05:06.849> separate<00:05:07.419> one<00:05:07.569> on<00:05:08.129> so<00:05:09.129> that

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:09.369 
but i will do a separate one on so that

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:13.079 
but i will do a separate one on so that
leave<00:05:09.699> in<00:05:09.939> more<00:05:10.659> depth<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.860> i'll<00:05:12.249> now<00:05:12.520> start<00:05:12.879> by

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.089 
leave in more depth so i'll now start by

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:16.379 
leave in more depth so i'll now start by
showing<00:05:13.569> you<00:05:13.749> this<00:05:14.319> trains<00:05:15.089> slow<00:05:16.089> speed

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
showing you this trains slow speed

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:27.530 
showing you this trains slow speed
running<00:05:16.629> which<00:05:16.899> is<00:05:17.110> quite<00:05:17.349> impressive

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.730 

yes<00:05:28.230> this<00:05:28.530> train<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:29.160> moving<00:05:29.430> and<00:05:30.410> that<00:05:31.410> that

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
yes this train is moving and that that

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.500 
yes this train is moving and that that
is<00:05:31.890> really<00:05:31.920> good<00:05:32.430> for<00:05:32.580> these<00:05:32.670> kinds<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.150> Isis

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
is really good for these kinds of Isis

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.900 
is really good for these kinds of Isis
the<00:05:33.630> HP<00:05:34.050> noses<00:05:35.120> don't<00:05:36.120> usually<00:05:36.270> expect<00:05:36.780> that

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
the HP noses don't usually expect that

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.310 
the HP noses don't usually expect that
so<00:05:38.910> now<00:05:39.710> what's<00:05:40.710> often<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.370> breakfast<00:05:41.910> eggs
