whole setup up here with you a massive
advantage<00:03:53.049> because<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.680> scatter<00:03:53.920> shot<00:03:54.010> in

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
advantage because the scatter shot in

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.860 
advantage because the scatter shot in
the<00:03:54.310> beginning<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.639> game<00:03:54.819> spawns<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.660> ring

the beginning the game spawns in ring

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.750 
the beginning the game spawns in ring
one<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.500> need<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:56.889> to<00:03:57.040> control<00:03:57.370> ring<00:03:57.549> 3

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
one and you need that to control ring 3

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.759 
one and you need that to control ring 3
also<00:03:57.970> Rockets<00:03:58.810> spawn<00:03:59.109> later<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.620> game

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
also Rockets spawn later in the game

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.860 
also Rockets spawn later in the game
like<00:03:59.980> they<00:04:00.130> are<00:04:00.250> right<00:04:00.489> there<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.599> know<00:04:01.840> I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
like they are right there and you know I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.110 
like they are right there and you know I
think<00:04:02.049> there's<00:04:02.380> two<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:03.160> two<00:04:03.519> big<00:04:03.700> things<00:04:03.910> here

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
think there's two to two big things here

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.520 
think there's two to two big things here
I<00:04:04.150> don't<00:04:04.389> think<00:04:04.599> it's<00:04:04.690> your<00:04:04.810> DM<00:04:05.079> our<00:04:05.200> accuracy

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
I don't think it's your DM our accuracy

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.140 
I don't think it's your DM our accuracy
I<00:04:05.650> think<00:04:05.889> your<00:04:05.980> DMR<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.430> actually<00:04:06.760> pretty<00:04:06.940> good

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
I think your DMR is actually pretty good

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.940 
I think your DMR is actually pretty good
man<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.569> we<00:04:07.959> can<00:04:08.079> all<00:04:08.200> talk<00:04:08.349> about<00:04:08.590> accuracy

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
man and we can all talk about accuracy

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.680 
man and we can all talk about accuracy
in<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> bullet<00:04:09.639> points<00:04:09.940> if<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.209> still<00:04:10.480> feel

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
like you want to be a little bit more

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.400 
like you want to be a little bit more
accurate<00:04:12.849> right<00:04:13.090> but<00:04:13.810> i<00:04:13.840> think<00:04:14.079> it's<00:04:14.200> matt

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
accurate right but i think it's matt

like wonderful but let's jump into the
bullet<00:04:59.139> points<00:04:59.289> so<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.620> talk<00:04:59.919> about<00:05:00.070> this

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
bullet points so I can talk about this

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.370 
bullet points so I can talk about this
further<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:03.070> number<00:05:03.280> one<00:05:03.550> take<00:05:04.210> map<00:05:04.750> control

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
further so number one take map control

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.439 
further so number one take map control
man<00:05:05.680> get<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.280> very<00:05:06.520> solid<00:05:06.910> team<00:05:07.060> who<00:05:07.210> stuck

maybe half an inch taller and that gives

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.610 
maybe half an inch taller and that gives
you<00:07:02.699> quite<00:07:03.389> a<00:07:03.449> bit<00:07:03.509> more<00:07:03.719> accuracy<00:07:04.199> I<00:07:04.349> feel

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
you quite a bit more accuracy I feel

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.019

like<00:07:04.830> they<00:07:04.949> take<00:07:05.069> a<00:07:05.129> while<00:07:05.339> to<00:07:05.460> get<00:07:05.580> used<00:07:05.849> to

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
like they take a while to get used to

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.719 
like they take a while to get used to
but<00:07:06.240> I<00:07:06.449> can't<00:07:07.080> play<00:07:07.439> without<00:07:07.770> a<00:07:08.189> control<00:07:08.580> freak

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729 
but I can't play without a control freak

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.730 
but I can't play without a control freak
now<00:07:09.029> you<00:07:09.360> know<00:07:09.449> I've<00:07:10.050> been<00:07:10.289> playing<00:07:10.529> with

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
now you know I've been playing with

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.980 
now you know I've been playing with
control<00:07:11.610> freaks<00:07:11.849> for<00:07:12.029> almost<00:07:12.180> two<00:07:12.449> years<00:07:12.749> I

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
control freaks for almost two years I

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.360 
control freaks for almost two years I
definitely<00:07:13.439> think<00:07:13.710> they<00:07:13.889> improve<00:07:14.219> your

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
definitely think they improve your

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.100 
definitely think they improve your
accuracy<00:07:14.699> don't<00:07:15.479> really<00:07:15.689> need<00:07:15.810> them<00:07:15.900> on<00:07:15.990> the

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
accuracy don't really need them on the

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.469 
accuracy don't really need them on the
left<00:07:16.289> stick<00:07:16.499> I<00:07:16.650> don't<00:07:16.800> think<00:07:17.039> but<00:07:17.370> if<00:07:18.180> you<00:07:18.300> want

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
left stick I don't think but if you want

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.790 
left stick I don't think but if you want
to<00:07:18.539> give<00:07:18.629> those<00:07:18.779> a<00:07:18.839> try<00:07:18.960> maybe<00:07:19.469> that'll<00:07:19.680> help

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
to give those a try maybe that'll help

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.249
