with<00:00:00.570> the<00:00:00.659> sample<00:00:01.110> it's<00:00:01.469> very<00:00:01.680> different<00:00:01.860> from

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
with the sample it's very different from

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.070 
with the sample it's very different from
any<00:00:02.159> other<00:00:02.340> Fender<00:00:02.730> amp<00:00:02.760> that<00:00:03.060> we've<00:00:03.270> created

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
any other Fender amp that we've created

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.390 
any other Fender amp that we've created
before<00:00:08.690> no<00:00:09.690> no<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.290> idea<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.830> being<00:00:11.040> like

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
before no no the idea of being like

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.220 
before no no the idea of being like
actually<00:00:11.910> someone<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.240> our<00:00:12.330> R&amp;D<00:00:12.690> came<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.080> with

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
actually someone in our R&amp;D came up with

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.099 
actually someone in our R&amp;D came up with
it<00:00:13.349> without<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:14.130> its<00:00:14.340> own<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.839> so

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
it without on its own and it was so

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.330 
it without on its own and it was so
different<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.590> anything<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.070> had<00:00:17.190> done

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
different for anything that we had done

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.620 
different for anything that we had done
before<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.000> thought<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.420> would<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
before that we thought it would be a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.179 
before that we thought it would be a
really<00:00:18.869> interesting<00:00:18.960> ham<00:00:19.380> something<00:00:19.859> outside

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
really interesting ham something outside

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.310 
really interesting ham something outside
of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.430> typical<00:00:20.820> ephemeral<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.449> whereas

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
of the typical ephemeral things whereas

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.590 
of the typical ephemeral things whereas
a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> fenders<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.340> said<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
a lot of fenders as you said it and you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240 
a lot of fenders as you said it and you
forget<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.260> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.560> thing<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:25.980> much

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
forget it kind of thing this is much

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.800 
forget it kind of thing this is much
more<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.609> someone<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> wants<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.599> really

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
more for someone that wants to really

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.429 
more for someone that wants to really
fine-tune<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:29.480> whether<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.720> destroyed

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
fine-tune it whether it's destroyed

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.800 
fine-tune it whether it's destroyed
so<00:00:32.980> you've<00:00:33.670> got<00:00:33.820> two<00:00:34.030> channels<00:00:34.360> I<00:00:34.630> actually

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
so you've got two channels I actually

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.270 
so you've got two channels I actually
consider<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.380> three<00:00:35.680> channels

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
consider a three channels

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.810 
consider a three channels
boost<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:38.960> overdrive<00:00:39.860> channel<00:00:40.340> so

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
boost and then overdrive channel so

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.510 
boost and then overdrive channel so
we'll<00:00:40.910> start<00:00:41.120> on<00:00:41.239> Channel

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:19.800 

to<00:00:48.150> be<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.480> different

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.630 

you<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:20.960> increase<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> gauge<00:01:21.770> all<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.430> great

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
you can increase the gauge all the great

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.010 
you can increase the gauge all the great
channel<00:01:23.060> if<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.210> want<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.600> see<00:01:23.780> we're<00:01:23.930> gonna

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
channel if you want to see we're gonna

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.539 
channel if you want to see we're gonna
add<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> little<00:01:24.290> bit<00:01:24.409> of<00:01:24.500> grit<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:25.040> that<00:01:25.189> sound

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
add a little bit of grit to that sound

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:40.929 
add a little bit of grit to that sound
now<00:01:38.320> here's<00:01:39.320> channel<00:01:39.979> comes<00:01:40.189> in<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:40.549> now<00:01:40.700> when

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
now here's channel comes in so now when

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.819 
now here's channel comes in so now when
you<00:01:41.030> get<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.299> first<00:01:41.509> channel<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.649> got<00:01:42.799> a

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
you get on the first channel it's got a

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.440 
you get on the first channel it's got a
full<00:01:43.070> novel<00:01:43.399> but<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.579> can<00:01:43.729> also<00:01:43.909> use<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.240> foot

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
full novel but you can also use the foot

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.319 
full novel but you can also use the foot
switch<00:01:48.130> now<00:01:49.130> we're<00:01:49.280> gonna<00:01:49.399> get<00:01:49.579> quite<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.119> bit

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
switch now we're gonna get quite a bit

00:01:50.329 --> 00:02:12.270 
switch now we're gonna get quite a bit
more<00:01:50.509> game<00:01:51.039> like<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.100> classic

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.330 

yeah<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.489> cool<00:02:13.700> what's<00:02:14.630> great<00:02:14.840> about<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.860> EQ

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
yeah it's cool what's great about the EQ

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.130 
yeah it's cool what's great about the EQ
on<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.150> very<00:02:17.180> sensitive<00:02:17.660> with

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
on this is that it's very sensitive with

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
on this is that it's very sensitive with
a<00:02:18.170> lot<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.380> older<00:02:18.650> amps<00:02:19.010> they<00:02:19.220> don't<00:02:19.430> do<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
a lot of older amps they don't do a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.759 
a lot of older amps they don't do a
whole<00:02:19.970> lot<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.330> little<00:02:20.660> bit<00:02:20.810> I'm<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.530> gonna

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
whole lot a little bit I'm just gonna

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.470 
whole lot a little bit I'm just gonna
play<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.220> bass<00:02:22.430> knob<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.150> hear<00:02:23.300> how

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
play the bass knob so you can hear how

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.030 
play the bass knob so you can hear how
much<00:02:23.630> bass<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.140> add<00:02:24.319> is<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> track<00:02:24.830> from

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
much bass you can add is the track from

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:42.009 
much bass you can add is the track from
the<00:02:25.190> nose<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.730> top<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.209> we<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.780> 3

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
the nose on top of that we have the 3

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.400 
the nose on top of that we have the 3
band<00:02:42.200> EQ<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:43.489> have<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> 2<00:02:43.970> node<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:45.049> what<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> 2

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
band EQ we have a 2 node and what the 2

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.380 
band EQ we have a 2 node and what the 2
not<00:02:45.650> does<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.160> takes<00:02:46.430> more<00:02:46.790> than<00:02:46.970> normal

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
not does it takes more than normal

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.320 
not does it takes more than normal
EQ<00:02:48.140> pump<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.799> want<00:02:49.040> an<00:02:49.130> amplifier<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:50.000> look

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
EQ pump is I want an amplifier you look

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.690 
EQ pump is I want an amplifier you look
at<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.599> there's<00:02:50.750> always<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.049> dip<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:52.280> takes<00:02:52.519> that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
at it there's always a dip it takes that

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.850 
at it there's always a dip it takes that
dip<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.360> actually<00:02:53.480> ships<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.319> as<00:02:54.500> opposed

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
dip and it actually ships it as opposed

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.380 
dip and it actually ships it as opposed
to<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.040> mid-range<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:55.849> shifts<00:02:56.150> where<00:02:56.299> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
to a mid-range it just shifts where the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.569 
to a mid-range it just shifts where the
dip<00:02:56.569> code<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:57.769> fine<00:02:58.010> tune<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.400> way

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
dip code so you can fine tune that way

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:20.150 
dip code so you can fine tune that way
as<00:02:58.760> well

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.720 

so<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.630> still<00:03:22.810> channel<00:03:23.140> one<00:03:25.140> jail<00:03:26.140> to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
so that's just still channel one jail to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.340 
so that's just still channel one jail to
plenty<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.880> gain<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.120> town<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:28.870> got<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.140> same

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
plenty of gain on town it's got the same

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:56.770 
plenty of gain on town it's got the same
sort<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.710> EQ<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.210> an<00:03:31.360> ability

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.030 

you<00:03:57.780> can<00:03:57.900> set<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.170> in<00:03:58.230> between<00:03:58.680> kind<00:03:58.950> of

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
you can set that in between kind of

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.720 
you can set that in between kind of
sound<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.720> digital<00:04:00.720> reverb<00:04:01.280> which<00:04:02.280> actually

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
sound to digital reverb which actually

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.710 
sound to digital reverb which actually
really<00:04:02.820> works<00:04:03.150> with<00:04:03.330> some<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.570> higher

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
really works with some of the higher

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.360 
really works with some of the higher
gain<00:04:03.960> settings<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.890> have<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:07.250> what<00:04:08.250> you're

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
gain settings you have to what you're

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.030 
gain settings you have to what you're
doing<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.960> tend<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.230> find<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.710> sounds

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
doing so we tend to find that it sounds

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.850 
doing so we tend to find that it sounds
fair<00:04:11.220> overall<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.910> amplifier<00:04:12.710> and<00:04:13.710> then

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
fair overall in this amplifier and then

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.039 
fair overall in this amplifier and then
it<00:04:13.950> also<00:04:14.100> has<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.430> damping<00:04:15.000> switch<00:04:15.300> which<00:04:16.020> is

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
it also has a damping switch which is

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.510 
it also has a damping switch which is
actually<00:04:16.440> an<00:04:16.500> effect<00:04:16.860> the<00:04:16.980> amount<00:04:17.100> of

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
actually an effect the amount of

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.190 
actually an effect the amount of
pushback<00:04:17.970> from<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.450> speakers<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.140> you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
pushback from the speakers so if you

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.680 
pushback from the speakers so if you
play<00:04:19.380> very<00:04:19.590> aggressive<00:04:20.040> music<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:21.180> go<00:04:21.330> tight

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
play very aggressive music you go tight

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.660 
play very aggressive music you go tight
the<00:04:22.470> speaker<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.890> going<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.100> push<00:04:23.460> back

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
the speaker is going to push back

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.490 
the speaker is going to push back
immediately<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:25.020> play<00:04:25.230> much<00:04:25.470> more

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
immediately so you can play much more

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
immediately so you can play much more

you've<00:04:26.850> said<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.120> looser<00:04:28.910> order<00:04:29.910> like

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
you've said in looser order like

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.230 
you've said in looser order like
secondary<00:04:30.540> harmonics<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:32.130> information<00:04:32.850> so

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
secondary harmonics and information so

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.610 
secondary harmonics and information so
depending<00:04:33.720> on<00:04:33.780> your<00:04:33.840> style<00:04:34.140> what<00:04:34.440> works

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
depending on your style what works

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.640 
depending on your style what works
better<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.690> close<00:04:36.930> back<00:04:37.170> it's<00:04:37.560> a

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
better for you it is close back it's a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.900 
better for you it is close back it's a
