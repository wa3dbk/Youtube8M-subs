00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.840
 you do not understand anything that's normal on 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.480
 game was not located 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.349
 finally translated what to sell a game 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 in different countries 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 it is important that he has several 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 languages ​​to his bow because as in the movies he 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.190
 you may look and part of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.780
 the story of your favorite hobbies 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 if he has no subtitles or 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.650
 dubbing tetris apart of course a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 army of translators are here to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.560
 the greatest pleasure of your eyes and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.270
 your ears forgetting either a request 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.290
 it's very varied it can be two words 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.820
 his door 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.370
 two hundred thousand words then we're going 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.700
 we keep two databases 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.410
 with work translators who are 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.210
 independent then we will send him 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.860
 all the elements he needs the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020
 text to translate the translator can 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 ask questions so either we can 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.480
 also meet itself itself or to the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.489
 pass on to developers once the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
 finished translation we get it back we do 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 a quality control checks that there is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 well a french in front of english 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.250
 the instructions we gave were 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.540
 respected that it's consistent 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.850
 translation the task is far from 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.130
 easy between respecting the original meaning 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.819
 and the timing provided if we often think 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.259
 to dialogue 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.939
 we must not forget everything that is 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.249
 the screen namely the menus the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.719
 indicators or inventories in addition 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.340
 of the game the translators will have to 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.799
 to the jackets to the press releases 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.729
 or textbooks at 300 euros 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 the hour is the job 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.999
 especially when we know that atlantica 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.009
 online had no less than 600 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.020
 miles often without any indication of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 situations where the characters they 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.679
 must still succeed in respecting 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.329
 the game world for example is it necessary 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.889
 translate all the proper names 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 as in world of warcraft 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.520
 should the neologisms be kept 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 technical terms and what to do with 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.329
 jokes that does not work in French the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.069
 main task of the translator will be 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.359
 finally make choices 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.279
 if a very good job and rarely 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.569
 notice however big mistakes 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:50.249
 can sometimes cross the world 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.409
 whole so it's better to pay attention 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.659
 and turn seven times his foreign language 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.240
 in his mouth before translating if we 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.069
 sees the character talking on the screen he 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.679
 will have to adapt the text to 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.950
 pleyel lips movements even a 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.090
 special software for text facing the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 good length when it is necessary to respect 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.979
 the lips we were going 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.060
 images of times one adjusts lips 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.180
 the rest the blurred images 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.460
 you have to try to stay consistent when 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.200
 even because late August the day to the end 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.980
 they understand what is asked of me 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.750
 often simple sentences without 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.490
 context the player when he will play there 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.940
 he'll say that's obvious because there is 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.940
 the tower is really cool video that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.640
 imagine a menu for example I would like 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 that it stays very short there also 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 constraints one has a number of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.830
 characters what is it again 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.930
 complicated because French is 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.090
 always longer than English for 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.680
 japanese games 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.740
 the Japanese precisely do translate into 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.380
 English before and then you give it back 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.470
 all the authors so that can be 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.209
 complicated because the text has gone 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.370
 from Japanese to English and then from 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.709
 English langued it can lose in 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.480
 that sense that forms so no need 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.070
 to put oneself in Japanese English remains 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 the master language even in the games 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.640
 video but the translation and in the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.620
 two senses so be careful not to 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.580
 neglect French and not to have 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.680
 zero dictation 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.170
 side studies steer towards a 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.239
 literary stream then an e in college or 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.620
 a school like visit to his days to 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.269
 abroad remains the best 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.880
 training to learn a language 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:29.240
 so I did 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.540
 training in college is law to reindeer a 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.710
 master trades the translation after I get 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.850
 am really put on video games to 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.640
 from the time I worked here 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.710
 now that you pass but he played 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.450
 for all those wishing to help 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.890
 location of foreign hits in our 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.100
 you know what you have left 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.100
 to do 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.020
 oh well it's still better like that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.020
 no
