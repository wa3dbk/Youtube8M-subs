00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 let's talk then about the multiples of a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.470
 number the multiples of a number according to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.480
 the definition that we have here are 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.550
 those results obtained at 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.220
 multiply that number by the numbers 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.279
 natural is to say for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 well 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 infinitely let's take for example the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.140
 multiples of 2 for it we are going to do 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.200
 well sorted mathematically and we're going to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.619
 write multiples of 2 a m 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.960
 we are going to have then that this is the same 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.970
 to open a key to represent 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.100
 then we will make a joint 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.130
 Well, we are going to have several elements 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.680
 several numbers then to get these 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.510
 multiples of 2 multiply by these 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.380
 numbers that are here multiply by 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 the first 2 by 1 2 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.030
 then 2 by 2 to 4 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 then we will have 2 x 3 which is 3 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.150
 which is up here gives 6 after 3 goes 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.230
 to follow the 4 2 for 4 to 8 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:12.640
 then we will have after this 4 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:15.550
 let's have the 5 2 by 5 10 and up 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 it will continue indefinitely how many 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.330
 multiples we want to have already then 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.470
 we close here 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.740
 and we have the multiples 2 4 6 8 and 10 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.740
 let's take for example the multiples 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.200
 from 6 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.830
 the multiples of 6 as we are going to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.310
 obtain 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:49.270
 as follows 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.270
 the multiples of 6 would be 6 x 16 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.060
 then 6 times 2 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.970
 12 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:04.810
 then 6 times 3 18 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.160
 then after 3 we have 4 and 6 by 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.160
 4 24 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.420
 and we put the ellipses for 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.880
 indicate 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.959
 that this continues indefinitely as the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.959
 multiples of a number 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.760
 they can be infinite and that's how 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.890
 we get multiples of the number here 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 we have obtained for 2 and here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.600
 we have obtained for 6 for any 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 number we want the multiples are going 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.820
 to always take out in the same way 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.820
 so
