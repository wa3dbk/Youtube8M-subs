playing<00:04:50.929> this<00:04:51.139> song<00:04:51.639> when<00:04:52.639> playing<00:04:52.849> this<00:04:52.999> song

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:53.209 
playing this song when playing this song

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.999 
playing this song when playing this song
I'm<00:04:53.689> using<00:04:53.959> a<00:04:54.169> technique<00:04:54.559> that's<00:04:54.619> called

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
I'm using a technique that's called

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.549 
I'm using a technique that's called
palming<00:04:55.639> and<00:04:56.539> what<00:04:56.689> that<00:04:56.809> is<00:04:56.839> is<00:04:56.989> that<00:04:57.439> I'm

00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:57.559 
palming and what that is is that I'm

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.499 
palming and what that is is that I'm
placing<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.279> palm<00:04:58.519> of<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.909> right<00:04:58.939> hand

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
placing the palm of my right hand

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.869 
placing the palm of my right hand
against<00:04:59.929> the<00:05:00.080> bridge<00:05:00.459> slightly<00:05:01.459> against<00:05:01.759> the

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
against the bridge slightly against the

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.600 
against the bridge slightly against the
strings<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.899> numb<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.319> sound<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.129> the<00:05:04.249> strings

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
strings to numb the sound of the strings

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:23.609 
strings to numb the sound of the strings
so<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.419> sounds<00:05:05.569> a<00:05:05.749> little<00:05:05.959> like<00:05:06.050> this<00:05:22.449> again

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:23.619 
so it sounds a little like this again

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.980 
so it sounds a little like this again
your<00:05:24.619> palm<00:05:25.269> against<00:05:26.269> the<00:05:26.419> bridge<00:05:26.719> and

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
your palm against the bridge and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:48.779 
your palm against the bridge and
slightly<00:05:27.499> numb<00:05:28.129> the<00:05:28.639> sound<00:05:28.969> of<00:05:29.119> the<00:05:29.209> strings

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.339 

okay<00:05:49.789> and<00:05:49.969> that<00:05:50.089> concludes<00:05:50.479> today's<00:05:50.719> lesson
