 Sunday of the last day of the month of May 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.970
 torments be points of the eastern half

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.840
 be perfectly modified in the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.790
 for tomorrow they will repeat with intensity 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.470

 we are counting this morning with 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.910
 absence of cloudiness and already as the long 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.800
 noon since the earth was going 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.049
 warming up those clouds were firing 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.600
 convective here we have that have been 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.190
 responsible for downloading storms 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.630
 important in fact in the detector of 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.130
 rays of the total agency we can 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.050
 appreciate these storms that you 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.290
 began to form timidly from

 of this month of May of speaking a 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.790
 day seemed today's tomorrow more 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.130
 sunny and in the afternoon we would see again 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.410
 how this cloudiness grows evolution in 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.210
 many points of the interior in areas of 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.010

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.780
 situation the step a little active front 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.550
