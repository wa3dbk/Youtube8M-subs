00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 now 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.420
 in similar 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.640
 star and characters as federer is 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.570
 I think that only with that 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.330
 It's enough 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.900
 for more than five months six months a year 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.460
 or whatever it is not 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:33.910
 no no no no no unclear how was your good 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:39.220
 Over it was my birthday 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.110
 he laughed because he told me who imagined 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.970
 together 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.430
 but well there the truth that I 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.160
 They gave a cake and it was fun and 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.180
 the advertising came out good also 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.730
 It stated that had grade 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.030
 separated and it's not for 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.880
 good a little what is generated with the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.620
 media is good we do not get along well 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.239
 we had good relationship but it is not 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.670
 not to be sharing bullying like 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.590
 Hollywood star to decide with 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.869
 who if government and good and now what 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.270
 better another one is coming if 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.110
 another recording is coming from for 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.000
 another publicity was difficult because I 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.090
 I was 18 and if there is no agreement spirit 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.520
 was 24 of the world was coming in full 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.990
 ascent 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.869
 and now that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.140
 They came very well with much desire miles 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.670
 of the world ahead 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.940
 the truth that has already earned me a respect 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.320
 in the circuit and out there this year I do not know 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.270
 if I had finished between 20 but 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 yes very close for the next year 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.330
 be with being young to be of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.430
 between 20 and be asking there between 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.750
 the best ones and when they suspended me 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.310
 it was a very hard hole 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.860
 only for me but for all my 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.600
 family 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.490
 the truth that I had a very bad time and the day 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.360
 today every time I remember it is a 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.050
 wound 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.390
 how impossible to close and there were two 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.580
 years that I lost to return for 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.130
 recover the level 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.380
 and as I always said I never did 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.869
 come back with the same happiness and the same 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.210
 tranquility like a glove to have 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.740
 been suspended always with a pen 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.760
 a lot of anger with a lot of hate and 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.050
 resentment and that generates a stress 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.090
 very big that when playing you 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.530
 plays against so almost everything 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.460
 I appreciate that much more what 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.800
 I could achieve after 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.580
 of having returned and I do not think they were 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.200
 two years 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.780
 that they went were very hard and that's why 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.670
 also the mental wear and have 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.410
 left out there so young they left 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.420
 accumulating many things but without a doubt 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.420
 that was what hurt the most 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.230
 when there is a doping form that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.280
 links with cocaine or with a little 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.790
 drug then being 18 years old 17 18 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.829
 I remember years when I had good 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.640
 I had a bad time and more when he is not 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.100
 quiet of what there is also one 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.170
 he realizes the people he had 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.300
 around in that moment and how is each 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.180
 one how it is handled 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.320
 and serves what hurts the most 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 ends up paying the player only to 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.970
 those who were around with time 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.190
 they forget and nobody knows who the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.890
 who were working with one then 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.790
 that the worst is always the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.050
 player now that yes for parents is something 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.700
 unique that everyone is going to change you 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.430
 life changes your life and one always 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.190
 says nothing for both wishes 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.500
 the truth that yes 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.420
 when I saw him leave 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.530
 but common in the now that never never 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.340
 I was thrilled normally I'm dealing with 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.430
 do not show much sensitivity 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.159
 we all have inside and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 It was amazing and obviously it changes you 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.629
 change life 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.130
 for him for your son and then they have 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.530
 stuck with this and it's always sauce 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.390
 and I want to bet a little more 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.920
 guys the player training calculates 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.340
 that between the two clubs we have almost 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.220
 400 500 boys in total form a good 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.200
 school that the tennis school does not that 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.030
 it's a string that goes into 15 the video 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.610
 per court and they go and it 's easy now 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.100
 and do nothing but in what way that 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:24.040
 be recreational that the kids learn 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.440
 they learn to pedra and the reverse to that the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 volley and give him a teaching and then 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.430
 what you want to devote a little more 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.710
 to quart that 3g and 2g a whatever already 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.840
 each one has its format 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.810
 training and good we were growing 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.030
 At first, it took us a while to find him 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.160
 the return but there we are already 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.960
 looking for the hand and after one and 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.360
 half the truth that the chain we are 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.700
 is very well is very well formed and 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.060
 we are we are happy for everything 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.560
 how can it be 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.290
 and I also always said that there 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.320
 they were always all good things and one 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.720
 is getting used to the victories and the 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.180
 success and when they have the first defeat 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.700
 or the first fall costs more than 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.780
 get up and one out there 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.280
 a bit of arrogance but of believing 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.370
 that he always has to win and that 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.020
 then already against so, but good 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.300
 I do not complain either, I always liked that 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.710
 I do well and I do not regret anything 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.350
 of everything I did because it's everything 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.780
 what I did was more as I always said 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.570
 that was bad positive that what bad and 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.450
 I stay with everything good and bad 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.750
 it was about taking out the positive thing that did not 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.750
 I liked 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.810
 now that we have not been many 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.090
 stews is your last week of right 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.979
 semi final because he knows he escaped a 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.550
 party in third with money there just 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.129
 very even match after having it 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.889
 won the following week and if the 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.729
 true that we suffer a lot but it is 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:56.400
 a person who costs him the pressure is 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.680
 he compares it a lot with me and it's a 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.020
 person who also wants us what 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.660
 come many things from my part wants 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.919
 earn it for the lonely and the re evil now 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.310
 that my family nation effort very 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.830
 great for to bank and help him and 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.350
 support him throughout his career and it's a 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.509
 good person has a very heart 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.200
 big and the time that everything that comes 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:23.030
 achieving and 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:25.010
 and also his goals because he deserves it 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.980
 How are you finding out about a 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.870
 person who has enough pressure for 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.460
 so I went as a player who has 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.530
 have that he is federico coria has to 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.460
 make your way your career and your life and 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.990
 her project 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.730
 have to 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.200
 to set a goal and fulfill it 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.820
 it has to be better or worse than me 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.680
 today he has to be the one and be happy with what 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.270
 that is because he is a very person 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.490
 respected and as I say is a person 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.980
 very good and I deserve the best so 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.370
 that I hope you can get to the most 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.370
 high possible
