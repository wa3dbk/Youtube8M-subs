the versatility I've taken the liberty

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.860 
the versatility I've taken the liberty
of<00:00:40.160> programming<00:00:40.850> for<00:00:40.879> different<00:00:41.449> sounds<00:00:41.780> so

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
of programming for different sounds so

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.570 
of programming for different sounds so
you<00:00:41.960> can<00:00:42.049> hear<00:00:42.140> this<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.589> a<00:00:42.620> good<00:00:42.920> clean<00:00:43.250> sound

bit of slight overdrive to it I can add
a<00:01:12.970> little<00:01:13.180> tremolo<00:01:13.660> just<00:01:13.930> by<00:01:14.080> bringing<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.560> the

again<00:01:47.980> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.280> add<00:01:48.490> effects<00:01:48.820> I've<00:01:49.000> got<00:01:49.150> a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
again you can add effects I've got a

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.330 
again you can add effects I've got a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
little bit of reverb on there if I

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.760 
little bit of reverb on there if I
wanted<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.730> add<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:51.970> little<00:01:52.300> delay<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:53.020> could<00:01:53.590> do

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
wanted to add a little delay I could do

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.930 
wanted to add a little delay I could do
that<00:01:54.390> simply<00:01:55.390> by<00:01:55.540> taking<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:57.370> knob<00:01:57.610> that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
that simply by taking the knob that

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.420 
that simply by taking the knob that
gives<00:01:58.720> me<00:01:58.900> all<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.620> modulation<00:02:00.160> based

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430

gives me all the modulation based
affects<00:02:01.890> adding<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.160> delay<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.670> could

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
affects adding a little delay I could

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.230 
affects adding a little delay I could
mix<00:02:04.480> that<00:02:04.690> in<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:12.400> channel<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:12.940> I've<00:02:13.030> got<00:02:13.060> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
mix that in that channel for I've got a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.930 
mix that in that channel for I've got a
full-blown<00:02:13.540> overdrive<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.580> one<00:02:15.760> was

full-blown overdrive and this one was
