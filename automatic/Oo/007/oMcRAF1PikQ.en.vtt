 Vladimir Safronov 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.480
 everyone who is watching our program now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.700
 sees me in his color or black and white 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 old or new tiny or huge 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 tv him something 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 TV and our release is dedicated to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 understand the essence of modern 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 TV set and our correspondent 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 Vyacheslav Gus decided to take a closer look. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.519
 meet his legendary ancestors 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.519
 kvn us 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.000
 kw 49 is not the first domestic television 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 Before him were Leningrad T1 and Muscovite you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 one models complicated expensive 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 therefore they were issued 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 microscopic series of several 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 dozens of pieces and in private apartments 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 citizens were not given them were given a member 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.210
 Central Committee of the Communist Party and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.250
 exemplary palace of culture 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.860
 she is a testing station 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 and in the evening the whole family and the neighbors 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.340
 Moscow Stakhanovites 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.610
 going off the TV screen in 1949 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.010
 year scientists from Leningrad

 Warsaw and Nikolaev 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.220
 made a model cheaper hynix he 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.330
 developed electrical circuit 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.700
 Warsaw device responsible for the design 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.990
 as well as for the production of TVs on 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.910
 different radio factories in our country and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 Nikolaev spent control 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.000
 test tv popiruyem onions 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.180
 the names of the fathers of the developers and called 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.750
 TV Ph.D. 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.010
 for 13 years forty-ninth by 62 to the light 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.860
 appeared about two and a half 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.690
 million kw and the device with the lens became 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 the usual detail of the interior of the Soviet 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.860
 the apartment is not only cheap fell 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.340
 first Soviet mass television set 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 but also with reliability, I will now say no 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.580
 ghost on this we generally threw away 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.800
 and we have it working condition well, I think 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:13.520
 that so the house of the year 73 here are the 20th years he 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.610
 worked so the TV still had time 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.220
 watch gagarin's first flight 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.220
 arrival of his meeting on Red Square 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.120
 grandfather of domestic television 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.340
 buildings and now ready to take two 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 central channels the picture he has to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.750
 it is still clear and the lens is full 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 distilled water did not dim in 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.519
 the fiftieth year, KVC cost 1350 rubles 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.830
 a little more than the average Soviet salary 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.799
 man today is a simple tv 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 will cost about 6000 rubles that is 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.299
 three average salaries and goes over half a century 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.190
 TV did not become more accessible 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.190
 and whether he became perfect 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.099
 kinescope tv is a spare flask 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.620
 inside the gun that shoots 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.019
 electrons on the screen from the inside 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.500
 the sides of the phosphor electrons hit the 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.000
 the phosphor un from this glows 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.010
 because the air in the office and have 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.140
 the vacuum she experiences is inhuman 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.569
 one kilogram external pressure per 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.120
 every square centimeter of screen total 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.409
 it turns out five tons so that the screen could 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.349
 endure such overloads 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.030
 his diode is spherical beyond that hemisphere 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:35.500
 easier to shoot electrons 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.250
 departing from one point fashionable 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.230
 flat screen 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 less glare and the picture on it as 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.549
 the photo is visible without any distortion 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.010
 point of the room but the manufacturer is forced 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.970
 try to arm a special device 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.069
 electron gun 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.290
 who knows how to fire a club field 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.810
 and also make a kinescope glass 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.329
 one and a half times thicker to atmospheric 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.950
 his pressure is not growing for it 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.099
 the buyer has to pay extra 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.079
 about 130 dollars but if not 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.090
 money on a flat screen can do without 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.799
 ordinary spherical just sit 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.310
 have to be strictly in front of the TV 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.750
 then there will be no distortion 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.879
 another new widescreen 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.160
 physiologists have found that human 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.440
 the pupil is easier to move left and right than 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.090
 up down with the effect increases 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.260
 the presence of the viewer feels 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.289
 party action movie 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.389
 or dramas cinemas began to twist 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.370
 widescreen films about manufacturers 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.190
 electronics have come up with a wide screen 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.130
 whose ratio of width to height is 16 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.139
 9 Alas, this screen needs a special one. 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.900
 picture to fully 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.199
 use the entire screen area 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.120
 must have 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.889
 source of programs corresponding to this 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.229
 format of the matter is that most 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:50.139
 programs now transmitted a4 3 format and 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.080
 attempt to fit them on screen with size 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.150
 16 9 leads to something 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.780
 the image is compressed by 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.849
 vertical 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.869
 or the edges remain unused 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.669
 image left and right 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.800
 remains defective even if 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.349
 TV station broadcasts this wide 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.029
 security film in general in all modern 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.889
 TV class 1 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.020
 be not korean and japanese or 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.360
 European picture is almost the same 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.029
 it can be customized so it will be like 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.300
 look so look in the store 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:25.939
 the most juicy is not necessary to choose 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.800
 the model is better you need to turn it off 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.229
 several vending machines and 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.889
 buy one from which kinescope is blacker 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.599
 he will have the best color rendition 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.849
 still worth asking about the frequency 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.550
 screen scan for conventional devices 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.800
 frequency is 50 hertz im i mean every 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.319
 second on the screen change 50 semi 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.449
 frames large screens often have 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.539
 100 hertz sweep rate i.e. 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:53.179
 frame as twice as likely to mean eksmenov 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.189
 becomes less noticeable and the picture is clearer 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:57.289
 the viewer is less tired eyes 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.809
 such a device costs one hundred and fifty 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.059
 dollars more expensive than usual 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:04.369
 the future viewer wants not only 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:06.889
 see better but hear better see 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:09.349
 stereo tv but 2 speakers on each side 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.329
 the screen is not necessarily a stereo and even 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.259
 no longer any stereo effect should 

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:20.029
 wait while watching news or football 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:21.939
 the fact is that in the domestic air on 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.849
 the territory of Russia 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:28.009
 The image is transferred to the format 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:32.149
 sikom and sound to him 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.639
 always goes in man mode and those who 

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.079
 acquires 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.329
 TVs with stereo sound 

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:40.550
 they must understand that everything is on the air 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:41.710
 programs they still watch in mo on 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.240
 background 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.820
 steril is useful only when viewing 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.460
 videos unless of course there is a stereo 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.500
 modern video tv recorder 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.980
 receivers can remember up to a hundred 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.840
 channels 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.760
 automatically adjusted to them 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.770
 automatically adjust the brightness 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.800
 contrast and color pictures 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.660
 show two channels at the same time 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.190
 on and off by timer but 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.380
 all expensive young models 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.050
 fundamentally little different from 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.690
 of old devices like the same KVN and 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.670
 after all, and the monster is stuffed with electronics and 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.710
 modest devices have a lens on the screen 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.740
 the main part is vacuum 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.200
 cathode ray tube on 625 lines 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.380
 one of the greatest inventions of the 20th 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.380
 century 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.540
 we also touched on the issue of revitalization 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.540
 regional activities 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.730
 what happens to the tv and 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.270
 television in the 21st century will the 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.270
 constructors come up with something better 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.270
 electron beam
