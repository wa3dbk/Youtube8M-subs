challenging so you can only do like six
to<00:00:10.679> ten<00:00:10.889> reps<00:00:11.210> like<00:00:12.210> putting<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.900> little

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
to ten reps like putting just a little

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.270 
to ten reps like putting just a little
bit<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> weight<00:00:13.410> behind<00:00:13.650> your<00:00:13.950> head<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
bit of weight behind your head on the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.820 
bit of weight behind your head on the
sit-ups<00:00:14.670> makes<00:00:14.969> them<00:00:15.120> very<00:00:15.330> tough

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
sit-ups makes them very tough

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.560 
sit-ups makes them very tough
same<00:00:17.310> thing<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> leg<00:00:17.820> raises<00:00:18.090> doesn't

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
same thing on the leg raises doesn't

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.029 
same thing on the leg raises doesn't
take<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.840> much<00:00:18.990> weight<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.439> make<00:00:19.590> these<00:00:19.740> very

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
take that much weight to make these very

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:29.419 
take that much weight to make these very
difficult<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.990> again<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.650> side<00:00:28.980> bends

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
difficult and again on these side bends

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
difficult and again on these side bends
there's<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> weight<00:00:30.750> only<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.410> six<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
there's a lot of weight only do six to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.570 
there's a lot of weight only do six to
eight<00:00:31.920> reps<00:00:32.810> and<00:00:33.950> instead<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.430> doing

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
eight reps and instead of just doing

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.100 
eight reps and instead of just doing
like<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.180> crunches<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.020> side<00:00:37.440> situps

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
like side crunches I do side situps

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:49.240 
like side crunches I do side situps
it<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> very<00:00:40.590> challenging

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.120 

and<00:00:49.790> also<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.600> plank<00:00:50.900> exercise<00:00:51.500> most<00:00:51.830> people

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
and also the plank exercise most people

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.890 
and also the plank exercise most people
just<00:00:52.280> do<00:00:52.490> this<00:00:52.700> on<00:00:53.420> their<00:00:53.990> forearms<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:55.450> a<00:00:56.450> lot

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
just do this on their forearms and a lot

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.360 
just do this on their forearms and a lot
of<00:00:56.930> people<00:00:57.230> can<00:00:57.350> hold<00:00:57.560> that<00:00:57.710> thing<00:00:58.010> for

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
of people can hold that thing for

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.220 
of people can hold that thing for
probably<00:00:58.970> two<00:00:59.150> minutes<00:00:59.480> three<00:00:59.720> minutes<00:00:59.750> even

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
probably two minutes three minutes even

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.420 
probably two minutes three minutes even
I<00:01:00.410> like<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.340> do<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:01.610> extended<00:01:02.300> plank<00:01:02.600> and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
I like to do this extended plank and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.010 
I like to do this extended plank and
this<00:01:04.430> is<00:01:04.580> much<00:01:04.910> more<00:01:05.150> difficult<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.840> then<00:01:05.930> you

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
this is much more difficult and then you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.510 
this is much more difficult and then you
can<00:01:06.170> still<00:01:06.470> do<00:01:06.710> your<00:01:08.170> basic<00:01:09.170> position<00:01:09.560> facing

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
can still do your basic position facing

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.010 
can still do your basic position facing
the<00:01:10.790> floor<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.210> then<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.360> can<00:01:11.510> still<00:01:11.810> do<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the floor and then you can still do the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.850 
the floor and then you can still do the
side<00:01:12.230> positions<00:01:13.570> as<00:01:14.570> well<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:18.530> then<00:01:18.650> this

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
side positions as well and then this

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.260 
side positions as well and then this
exercise<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.950> best<00:01:21.979> oblique<00:01:22.580> exercise<00:01:23.060> I

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
exercise is the best oblique exercise I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.960 
exercise is the best oblique exercise I
know<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:24.040> because<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:25.160> get<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.430> pull<00:01:25.670> through

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
know of because you get to pull through

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.460 
know of because you get to pull through
for<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.270> entire<00:01:26.600> range<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.960> motion<00:01:27.020> most

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
for the entire range of motion most

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.080 
for the entire range of motion most
obliques<00:01:27.890> are<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.250> from<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.550> side<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
obliques are just from the side to the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.790 
obliques are just from the side to the
middle<00:01:29.210> this<00:01:29.570> one's<00:01:29.780> from<00:01:29.960> one<00:01:30.229> side<00:01:30.470> all<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
middle this one's from one side all the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.219 
middle this one's from one side all the
way<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.130> other<00:01:31.280> side<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.720> again<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.080> can

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
way to the other side and again you can

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.450 
way to the other side and again you can
add<00:01:33.260> enough<00:01:33.590> weight<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.860> make<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.280> very

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
add enough weight to make it very

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.480 
add enough weight to make it very
difficult<00:01:38.050> then<00:01:39.050> this<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.350> one<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:40.130> lot<00:01:40.310> of

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
difficult then this is one that a lot of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.030 
difficult then this is one that a lot of
a<00:01:40.940> lot<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.810> athletes<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.290> my<00:01:42.410> school<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:42.890> to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
a lot of athletes in my school have to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.060 
a lot of athletes in my school have to
do<00:01:43.190> it's<00:01:43.729> called<00:01:43.880> body<00:01:44.150> curls<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.890> that

do it's called body curls and that

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.010 
do it's called body curls and that
requires<00:01:46.430> some<00:01:47.119> decent<00:01:47.479> upper-body<00:01:47.840> strength

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
requires some decent upper-body strength

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
requires some decent upper-body strength
as<00:01:48.470> well<00:01:48.650> as<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.430> can<00:01:49.610> imagine

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.810 

you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.320> try<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.250> straight<00:01:56.640> leg

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you can do try to do a straight leg

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.900 
you can do try to do a straight leg
variation<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.050> is<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.160> more<00:01:59.700> difficult

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.740 

then<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.030> last<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.660> just<00:02:04.230> rollouts<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
then this last one is just rollouts and

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.919 
then this last one is just rollouts and
again<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.509> feet

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
again when you you go out on your feet

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420 
again when you you go out on your feet
and<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.259> extend<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.800> arms<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:11.130> far<00:02:11.190> as

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and then you extend your arms as far as

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.220 
and then you extend your arms as far as
you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.760> until<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.240> can't<00:02:12.570> hold<00:02:12.720> yourself<00:02:12.840> up

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you can until you can't hold yourself up

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.380 
you can until you can't hold yourself up
anymore<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.850> dropped<00:02:15.090> your<00:02:15.210> knees

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
anymore and then you dropped your knees

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
anymore and then you dropped your knees
and<00:02:15.570> finish<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.990> movement<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and finish the movement like that that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.340 
and finish the movement like that that
way<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> know<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.390> push<00:02:18.660> yourself<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.140> far<00:02:19.170> as

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
way you know you push yourself as far as

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.699 
way you know you push yourself as far as
you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.740> each<00:02:19.920> time<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:22.170> may<00:02:22.320> not<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.620> able
