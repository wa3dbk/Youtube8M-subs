more minutes over this gameplay just
getting<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> look<00:02:53.360> like<00:02:53.420> four<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.019> don't

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
getting it to look like four but I don't

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.910 
getting it to look like four but I don't
even<00:02:54.290> know<00:02:54.470> where<00:02:54.560> I'm<00:02:54.650> going<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.829> go<00:02:54.890> with

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
even know where I'm going to go with

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.890 
even know where I'm going to go with
this<00:02:55.129> but<00:02:55.489> yes<00:02:55.819> why<00:02:56.150> don't<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.360> talk<00:02:56.540> about<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
this but yes why don't we talk about the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.449 
this but yes why don't we talk about the
maps<00:02:57.110> because<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.709> going<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.950> be<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.069> very

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
maps because that is going to be a very

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.119 
maps because that is going to be a very
relevant<00:02:58.879> topic<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.480> black<00:02:59.780> ops<00:02:59.989> 2<00:03:00.109> so<00:03:00.769> there

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
relevant topic in black ops 2 so there

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.800 
relevant topic in black ops 2 so there
are<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.340> lot<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.700> high<00:03:01.940> points<00:03:02.359> in<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.720> game

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
are a lot of high points in this game

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.830 
are a lot of high points in this game
now<00:03:03.230> if<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.739> realize<00:03:04.160> black<00:03:04.790> ops<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.510> first

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
now if you realize black ops the first

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.420 
now if you realize black ops the first
did<00:03:06.109> not<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.410> very<00:03:06.620> many<00:03:06.799> high<00:03:07.069> points<00:03:07.340> in

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
did not have very many high points in

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.039 
did not have very many high points in
them<00:03:07.549> at<00:03:07.730> all<00:03:07.879> a<00:03:08.150> matter<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.480> fact<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:09.019> only

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
them at all a matter of fact the only

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.569 
them at all a matter of fact the only
maps<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.590> think<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.859> with<00:03:09.980> high<00:03:10.099> points<00:03:10.459> are

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
maps I can think of with high points are

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.059 
maps I can think of with high points are
array<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.359> jungle<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.049> in<00:03:12.349> this<00:03:12.500> one<00:03:12.680> I've

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
array and jungle and in this one I've

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.099 
array and jungle and in this one I've
seen<00:03:13.310> about<00:03:13.489> five<00:03:13.549> maps<00:03:14.120> with<00:03:14.359> very<00:03:14.660> nice<00:03:14.900> high

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
seen about five maps with very nice high

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.720 
seen about five maps with very nice high
vantage<00:03:15.349> points<00:03:15.739> for<00:03:15.890> trick<00:03:16.160> shot<00:03:16.400> or<00:03:16.519> if

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
vantage points for trick shot or if

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.130 
vantage points for trick shot or if
you're<00:03:17.030> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.239> be<00:03:17.359> trickshotting<00:03:17.810> in<00:03:17.989> this

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
you're going to be trickshotting in this

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.809 
you're going to be trickshotting in this
game<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.530> trickshotting<00:03:19.160> does<00:03:19.489> look<00:03:19.670> good

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
game and trickshotting does look good

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.390 
game and trickshotting does look good
the<00:03:20.660> why<00:03:20.930> why<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.500> back<00:03:21.859> but<00:03:22.069> some<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
the why why is back but some of the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.369 
the why why is back but some of the
other<00:03:22.519> things<00:03:22.579> are<00:03:22.879> not<00:03:23.060> as<00:03:23.120> preeminent<00:03:23.720> but

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
other things are not as preeminent but

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.839 
other things are not as preeminent but
don't<00:03:24.590> worry<00:03:24.769> if<00:03:24.950> your<00:03:25.069> trick<00:03:25.310> shot<00:03:25.459> or<00:03:25.579> just

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
don't worry if your trick shot or just

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.759 
don't worry if your trick shot or just
like<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.150> am<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.750> can<00:03:26.870> go<00:03:26.930> ahead<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.139> stay<00:03:27.590> with

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
like I am you can go ahead and stay with

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.530 
like I am you can go ahead and stay with
mono<00:03:27.980> or<00:03:28.040> 42<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.609> this<00:03:28.760> game<00:03:28.940> will<00:03:29.090> also<00:03:29.389> have

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
mono or 42 and this game will also have

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.089 
mono or 42 and this game will also have
it's<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.750> little<00:03:29.930> bit<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.200> did<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:30.980> there

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
it's a little bit I did see that there

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.670 
it's a little bit I did see that there
is<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.430> fade<00:03:31.790> coming<00:03:32.209> back<00:03:32.389> in<00:03:32.660> black<00:03:33.319> ops<00:03:33.530> 2

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
is the fade coming back in black ops 2

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.150 
is the fade coming back in black ops 2
there<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.609> why<00:03:34.940> why<00:03:35.120> there<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.810> no<00:03:36.160> pistol

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
there is the why why there is no pistol

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.860 
there is the why why there is no pistol
swap<00:03:37.370> but<00:03:37.579> there<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.819> some<00:03:38.090> claim<00:03:38.299> or<00:03:38.510> cancels

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
swap but there is some claim or cancels

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.720 
swap but there is some claim or cancels
and<00:03:38.959> stuff<00:03:39.349> like<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.859> little<00:03:40.700> things

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
and stuff like that and little things

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.909 
and stuff like that and little things
I'm<00:03:41.060> not<00:03:41.329> sure<00:03:41.569> about<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.870> lefty<00:03:42.169> loosey<00:03:42.530> but

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
I'm not sure about the lefty loosey but

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.979 
I'm not sure about the lefty loosey but
regardless<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.760> call<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.150> duty<00:03:44.389> looks<00:03:44.690> so

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
regardless this call of duty looks so

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.809 
regardless this call of duty looks so
good<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.410> one<00:03:45.739> thing<00:03:45.769> also<00:03:46.250> about<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.639> maps

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
good and one thing also about the maps

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.039 
good and one thing also about the maps
if<00:03:47.060> you've<00:03:47.329> noticed<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> color

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
if you've noticed that the color

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.509 
if you've noticed that the color
correction<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.620> does<00:03:48.859> look<00:03:48.889> a<00:03:49.220> little<00:03:49.370> more

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
correction it does look a little more

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.309 
correction it does look a little more
futuristic<00:03:50.060> than<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.480> original<00:03:50.930> black<00:03:51.079> ops

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
futuristic than the original black ops

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.979 
futuristic than the original black ops
as<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.859> can<00:03:51.950> tell<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.400> nuketown<00:03:52.760> 2025

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
as you can tell this is nuketown 2025

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.839 
as you can tell this is nuketown 2025
and<00:03:53.989> not<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.349> original<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.980> they<00:03:55.250> spruced

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
and not the original and they spruced

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.250 
and not the original and they spruced
everything<00:03:56.269> up<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.540> they<00:03:56.690> made<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> quality

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
everything up and they made the quality

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.140 
everything up and they made the quality
looks<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.560> lot<00:03:57.829> better<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.280> lot<00:03:58.370> more<00:03:58.669> futuristic

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
looks a lot better a lot more futuristic

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.940 
looks a lot better a lot more futuristic
and<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.510> lot<00:03:59.690> more<00:03:59.840> mesh<00:04:00.230> if<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.709> makes<00:04:00.889> any

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
and a lot more mesh if that makes any

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.650 
and a lot more mesh if that makes any

but notice our sniper rifle is gonna be

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.889 
but notice our sniper rifle is gonna be
overpowered<00:05:52.909> in<00:05:53.089> this<00:05:53.269> game<00:05:53.449> as<00:05:53.629> they<00:05:53.749> are

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:53.899 
overpowered in this game as they are

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:55.809 
overpowered in this game as they are
usually<00:05:54.169> because<00:05:54.919> as<00:05:55.189> you<00:05:55.309> can<00:05:55.339> tell<00:05:55.610> it

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
usually because as you can tell it

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.389 
usually because as you can tell it
scopes<00:05:56.240> in<00:05:56.449> very<00:05:56.870> fast<00:05:57.289> and<00:05:57.620> that's<00:05:58.129> not<00:05:58.219> going

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:58.399 
scopes in very fast and that's not going

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.679 
scopes in very fast and that's not going
to<00:05:58.490> lead<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.639> too<00:05:58.819> many<00:05:58.939> good<00:05:59.149> things<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.569> know

00:05:59.679 --> 00:05:59.689 
to lead to too many good things I know

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.899 
to lead to too many good things I know
the<00:05:59.959> entire<00:06:00.289> reason<00:06:00.499> black<00:06:01.039> ops<00:06:01.219> the<00:06:01.459> original

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
the entire reason black ops the original

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.399 
the entire reason black ops the original
didn't<00:06:02.120> have<00:06:02.240> it<00:06:02.360> is<00:06:02.509> because<00:06:02.930> sniping<00:06:03.289> was

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
didn't have it is because sniping was

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.570 
didn't have it is because sniping was
overpowered<00:06:03.919> do<00:06:04.219> you<00:06:04.309> think<00:06:04.459> they

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
overpowered do you think they

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.519 
overpowered do you think they
overcompensated<00:06:05.479> and<00:06:05.719> make<00:06:05.839> sniping<00:06:06.259> too

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 
overcompensated and make sniping too
