we just you know you think you know what
it<00:01:54.540> looks<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:55.680> until<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> go

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
it looks like but you don't until you go

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.810 
it looks like but you don't until you go
deep<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> details<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.170> amazing<00:01:58.820> yeah

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
deep and the details it is amazing yeah

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.510 
deep and the details it is amazing yeah
I<00:01:59.850> mean<00:02:00.060> recreating<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:01.280> yes<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.399> have

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I mean recreating or yes we have

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.580 
I mean recreating or yes we have
recreated<00:02:02.880> things<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> original<00:02:04.290> movie

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
recreated things from the original movie

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.350 
recreated things from the original movie
but<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.700> importantly<00:02:05.850> than<00:02:06.210> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
but I think more importantly than that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
but I think more importantly than that
we've<00:02:06.630> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> expanded<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> universe

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
we've kind of expanded on that universe

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.919 
we've kind of expanded on that universe
we've<00:02:08.310> kind<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.550> deconstructed<00:02:09.479> everything

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
we've kind of deconstructed everything

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.930 
we've kind of deconstructed everything
understood<00:02:10.830> how<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.220> put<00:02:11.370> together<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
understood how it was put together and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.620 
understood how it was put together and
then

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
then

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.110 
then
able<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.320> know<00:02:13.440> rebuild<00:02:13.890> an<00:02:14.370> environment

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
able to you know rebuild an environment

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
able to you know rebuild an environment
which<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.780> feels<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:17.010> could<00:02:17.040> have

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
which you know feels like it could have

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.210 
which you know feels like it could have
been<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> set<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.030> 1979<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.890> you're

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
been on the set of 1979 so you're

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.650 
been on the set of 1979 so you're
talking<00:02:20.430> about<00:02:20.700> how<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:20.940> not<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.360> guns

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
talking about how it's not a guns
