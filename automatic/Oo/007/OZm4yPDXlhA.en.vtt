hey youtubers you boy rocky rusts today

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.660 
hey youtubers you boy rocky rusts today
I'm<00:00:03.030> back<00:00:03.210> for<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.110> what<00:00:05.100> really<00:00:05.339> should<00:00:05.609> have

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
I'm back for and what really should have

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.190 
I'm back for and what really should have
been<00:00:05.790> part<00:00:06.150> two<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.660> build<00:00:06.899> but<00:00:07.170> it's

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
been part two of the build but it's

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500 
been part two of the build but it's
going<00:00:07.410> over<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.770> be<00:00:07.859> part<00:00:08.160> free<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.790> it's

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
going over to be part free and it's

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.730 
going over to be part free and it's
because<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> few<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.200> guys<00:00:10.230> are<00:00:10.559> really

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
because a few of you guys are really

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.589 
because a few of you guys are really
interested<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.250> my<00:00:11.490> actual<00:00:11.790> pc<00:00:12.120> build<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
interested in my actual pc build and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.270 
interested in my actual pc build and
what<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:12.900> saying<00:00:13.110> well<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.530> didn't<00:00:14.070> really

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
what we saying well you didn't really

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.640 
what we saying well you didn't really
show<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.820> installed<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> parts<00:00:15.900> you

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
show how you installed the parts you

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.840 
show how you installed the parts you
know<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> few<00:00:16.980> people<00:00:17.279> interested<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.699> building

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
know a few people interested in building

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.609 
know a few people interested in building
their<00:00:18.060> own<00:00:18.210> now<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.690> i'm<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.230> gonna<00:00:19.470> go

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
their own now so i'm just gonna go

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.140 
their own now so i'm just gonna go
quickly<00:00:19.920> back<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.460> show<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.670> how<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.000> install

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
quickly back and show you how to install

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.890 
quickly back and show you how to install
a<00:00:21.510> few<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> parts<00:00:23.269> you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.390> i<00:00:24.420> did<00:00:24.750> in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
a few of the parts you know i did in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070 
a few of the parts you know i did in
from<00:00:25.680> part<00:00:25.980> 2<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.359> first<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.840> can't

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
from part 2 and so first of all I can't

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040 
from part 2 and so first of all I can't
really<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.769> off<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.130> cpu<00:00:29.429> cooler<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> due

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
really take off the cpu cooler and due

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.179 
really take off the cpu cooler and due
to<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> fact<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:31.949> heat

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to the fact that you know it's got heat

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.470 
to the fact that you know it's got heat
sink<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:32.790> can't<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.180> show<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.360> how

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
sink on and i can't really show you how

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
sink on and i can't really show you how
to<00:00:33.540> install<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.320> mean<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> motherboards

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to install that I mean the motherboards

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.060 
to install that I mean the motherboards
real<00:00:35.760> straightforward<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.660> these

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
real straightforward you get these

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.319 
real straightforward you get these
things<00:00:38.070> called<00:00:38.309> standoffs<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.180> gone

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
things called standoffs which is gone

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.610 
things called standoffs which is gone
the<00:00:39.450> inside<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.840> case<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.379> sink

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the inside of your case and you sink

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.780 
the inside of your case and you sink
when<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> put<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:40.950> motherboard<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
when you put your motherboard on and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
when you put your motherboard on and
then<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.870> find<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.260> screw<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.860> like

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
then if I can find a screw just like

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
then if I can find a screw just like
that<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.250> down<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.640> simply<00:00:45.510> seven<00:00:45.899> or

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that one down there simply seven or

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.180 
that one down there simply seven or
eight<00:00:46.079> screws<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> screw<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
eight screws just to screw your

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
eight screws just to screw your
motherboard<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> back<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> case<00:00:48.780> so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
motherboard to the back of the case so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
motherboard to the back of the case so
that's<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.410> straightforward<00:00:50.600> obviously

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that's really straightforward obviously

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.150 
that's really straightforward obviously
just<00:00:51.780> talked<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> CPU<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.070> know

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
just talked about the CPU you know

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.900 
just talked about the CPU you know
you'll<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> read<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.789> instruction

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you'll have to read your instruction

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.990 
you'll have to read your instruction
depending<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
depending which one you get that and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.340 
depending which one you get that and
then<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.270> power<00:00:57.539> supply<00:00:57.989> that's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
then on to this power supply that's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
then on to this power supply that's
really<00:00:58.620> straightforward<00:00:58.890> whether<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
really straightforward whether it's the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
really straightforward whether it's the
bottom<00:00:59.699> wall<00:01:00.000> power<00:01:00.329> supply<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.719> sometimes

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
bottom wall power supply or sometimes

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
bottom wall power supply or sometimes
look<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.680> top<00:01:01.890> left<00:01:02.100> corner<00:01:02.160> there<00:01:02.579> as

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
look up in the top left corner there as

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.820 
look up in the top left corner there as
well<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:04.019> simply<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> sit<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> down

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
well and it's simply to sit it down

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
well and it's simply to sit it down
it'll<00:01:05.339> click<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:05.820> place<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.080> back

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it'll click into place and then the back

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.510 
it'll click into place and then the back
here<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> missed<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.369> more

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
here I missed you don't get bit more

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
here I missed you don't get bit more
weight<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:11.010> four

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
weight on it not really and just four

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.149 
weight on it not really and just four
screws<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.659> power<00:01:12.900> supply<00:01:13.260> super

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
screws that's it so power supply super

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
screws that's it so power supply super
easy<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> install<00:01:14.700> motherboards<00:01:15.030> super<00:01:15.810> easy

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
easy to install motherboards super easy

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.350 
easy to install motherboards super easy
to<00:01:16.020> install<00:01:16.549> CPU<00:01:17.549> depending<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to install CPU depending which one you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
to install CPU depending which one you
get<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.780> using<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.110> stock<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.650> an

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
get will be using a stock or an

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.429 
get will be using a stock or an
aftermarket<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.549> me<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.439> relatively

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
aftermarket one like me and relatively

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.899 
aftermarket one like me and relatively
straightforward<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.460> would<00:01:23.610> probably<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
straightforward that would probably the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.310 
straightforward that would probably the
bit<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:24.840> concerned<00:01:24.990> about

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
bit that was most concerned about

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
bit that was most concerned about
obviously<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
obviously because you need to get that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
obviously because you need to get that
right<00:01:27.740> then<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.340> ram<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.630> sticks<00:01:30.900> around

ones ram always runs in pairs so you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.139 
ones ram always runs in pairs so you
need<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.310> check<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.729> motherboard

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149

run<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.670> i'm<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> simply<00:02:03.240> click

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
run so i'm just going to simply click

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.709 
run so i'm just going to simply click
these<00:02:03.719> two<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:06.000> white<00:02:06.180> switches

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
these two well for little white switches

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.080 
these two well for little white switches
down<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.580> then<00:02:08.580> all<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> need<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.000> do

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
down up and then all you need to do

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
simply just look at the ram and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
simply just look at the ram and
obviously<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> slight<00:02:12.270> divot<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
obviously it's got a slight divot in the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
obviously it's got a slight divot in the
middle<00:02:13.020> there

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
middle there

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.190 
middle there
you<00:02:13.640> just<00:02:13.819> need<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.060> look<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:15.230> simply<00:02:15.740> align

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you just need to look and simply align

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.780 
you just need to look and simply align
the<00:02:18.200> RAM<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.890> what<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.160> want<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.340> do<00:02:19.490> is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the RAM in and what you want to do is

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.940 
the RAM in and what you want to do is
just<00:02:20.030> push<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.780> get<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.380> straight<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
just push it get it straight in the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.690 
just push it get it straight in the
middle<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:24.040> simple<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.220> edge<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
middle like this and simple just edge it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.490 
middle like this and simple just edge it
down<00:02:25.880> till<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.240> hear<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> two<00:02:26.900> pins<00:02:27.200> either

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
down till you hear the two pins either

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.140 
down till you hear the two pins either
side<00:02:27.940> click<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> place<00:02:29.390> like<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:31.030> get<00:02:32.030> better

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
side click in a place like so get better

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.910 
side click in a place like so get better
angle<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.140> now<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.319> two<00:02:33.560> pins<00:02:33.800> have

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
angle of that so now the two pins have

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.650 
angle of that so now the two pins have
clicked<00:02:34.190> up<00:02:34.370> I'll<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.090> grab<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> one<00:02:35.510> really

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
clicked up I'll just grab the one really

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.740 
clicked up I'll just grab the one really
quickly<00:02:35.900> pop<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.739> just<00:02:40.400> push<00:02:40.670> down

quickly pop that in and just push down

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.540 
quickly pop that in and just push down
sequentially<00:02:41.750> either<00:02:42.230> side<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.130> until

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
sequentially either side like so until

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.490 
sequentially either side like so until
the<00:02:43.640> pins<00:02:43.850> clip<00:02:44.150> into<00:02:44.660> place<00:02:44.810> there<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.410> go

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the pins clip into place there you go

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.850 
the pins clip into place there you go
ahead<00:02:45.769> then<00:02:45.800> click<00:02:46.130> in<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:48.380> that's<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> ram

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
ahead then click in so that's the ram

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.090 
ahead then click in so that's the ram
installed<00:02:49.250> super<00:02:49.820> easy<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.860> to

going to run on like I don't know what

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.190 
going to run on like I don't know what
that<00:03:56.580> particular<00:03:56.910> name<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.720> not<00:03:57.870> start

that particular name is for it not start
a<00:03:58.290> power<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:58.800> these<00:03:59.370> really<00:03:59.670> thin<00:03:59.850> ones<00:04:00.090> like

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
a power but these really thin ones like

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.020 
a power but these really thin ones like
that<00:04:00.420> I'll<00:04:00.600> check<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.960> manual<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.880> yeah

whilst<00:04:06.720> holding<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.140> phone<00:04:07.580> simple<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.640> just

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
whilst holding the phone simple you just

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.200 
whilst holding the phone simple you just
look<00:04:09.030> there<00:04:09.270> like<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:11.640> find<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
look there like that and you find the

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.710 
look there like that and you find the
swap<00:04:12.600> right<00:04:13.410> there<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.850> think<00:04:15.150> simply

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
swap right there and you think simply

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.620 
swap right there and you think simply
just<00:04:16.110> plug<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:17.030> there<00:04:18.030> we<00:04:18.150> go<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.510> that's

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
just plug that in there we go so that's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.070 
just plug that in there we go so that's
in<00:04:18.989> nice<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.410> tight<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:19.920> there<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.840> then<00:04:21.840> so

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
in nice and tight in there and then so

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.560 
in nice and tight in there and then so
that's<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.380> power<00:04:22.590> fica<00:04:23.010> CD<00:04:23.430> Drive<00:04:23.820> what<00:04:24.480> you

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
that's the power fica CD Drive what you

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.140 
that's the power fica CD Drive what you
then<00:04:24.750> need<00:04:24.960> is<00:04:25.380> something<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.250> receive<00:04:26.730> and

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
then need is something to receive and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.880 
then need is something to receive and
send<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.690> data<00:04:27.900> which<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.440> going<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:28.830> a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
send the data which is going to be a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.990 
send the data which is going to be a
SATA<00:04:29.280> cable<00:04:29.730> in<00:04:29.820> my<00:04:29.850> case<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.900> I've<00:04:30.990> got<00:04:31.110> this

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
SATA cable in my case so I've got this

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.650 
SATA cable in my case so I've got this
black<00:04:33.000> SATA<00:04:33.330> cable<00:04:33.780> here<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:35.940> it's<00:04:36.090> simply

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
black SATA cable here and so it's simply

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.260 
black SATA cable here and so it's simply
again<00:04:36.930> he's<00:04:37.590> plugging<00:04:37.890> in<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:38.940> liquid

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
again he's plugging in to the liquid

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.810 
again he's plugging in to the liquid
sharts<00:04:39.650> look<00:04:42.890> simply<00:04:43.890> putting<00:04:44.130> your<00:04:44.400> starter

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
sharts look simply putting your starter

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.060 
sharts look simply putting your starter
power<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.480> then<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.140> your<00:04:46.290> motherboard<00:04:46.530> I've

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
power and then on your motherboard I've

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.180 
power and then on your motherboard I've
got<00:04:47.430> six<00:04:47.880> starts<00:04:48.330> lots<00:04:48.570> down<00:04:48.810> here<00:04:49.170> so<00:04:50.130> just

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
got six starts lots down here so just

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.740 
got six starts lots down here so just
depending<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.090> know<00:04:51.210> where<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.480> want<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.690> to

depending you know where you want it to

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.340 
depending you know where you want it to
go<00:04:51.990> mine<00:04:52.290> this<00:04:52.650> one's<00:04:52.890> going<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.490> SATA<00:04:54.270> 2<00:04:54.690> if

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
go mine this one's going to SATA 2 if

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.710 
go mine this one's going to SATA 2 if
you<00:04:55.500> just<00:04:55.680> simply<00:04:56.190> click<00:04:56.700> that<00:04:56.850> in<00:04:57.000> there<00:04:57.600> we

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
you just simply click that in there we

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.870 
you just simply click that in there we
go<00:04:57.900> that's<00:04:58.350> installed<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.430> then<00:04:59.670> it's<00:04:59.790> just

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
go that's installed and then it's just

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.250 
go that's installed and then it's just
pretty<00:05:00.120> much<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.420> same<00:05:00.570> for<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.840> hard<00:05:01.020> drive

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
pretty much the same for the hard drive

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.860 
pretty much the same for the hard drive
really<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:02.370> remember<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.390> said<00:05:03.600> about<00:05:03.780> the

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.600 
it's going to brought blowing really
nice<00:05:13.350> cold<00:05:13.650> air<00:05:13.830> across<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.100> hard<00:05:14.370> drive

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
nice cold air across the hard drive

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.060 
nice cold air across the hard drive
obviously<00:05:15.000> try<00:05:15.210> not<00:05:15.420> to<00:05:15.540> touch<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:16.200> green

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
obviously try not to touch the green

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.540 
obviously try not to touch the green
circuit<00:05:17.580> board<00:05:17.790> I<00:05:18.030> went<00:05:18.780> for<00:05:19.020> slot<00:05:19.920> number<00:05:20.100> one

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
circuit board I went for slot number one

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.030 
circuit board I went for slot number one
up<00:05:20.700> here<00:05:20.850> so<00:05:21.270> sorry<00:05:22.050> about<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.350> camera<00:05:22.560> work

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
up here so sorry about the camera work

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:31.090 
up here so sorry about the camera work
so<00:05:23.220> how<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.460> do<00:05:23.670> quite<00:05:23.940> absolute<00:05:24.360> 100

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:40.270 

I<00:05:31.900> was<00:05:32.900> one<00:05:33.080> second<00:05:36.280> my<00:05:38.830> approach<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:39.860> got<00:05:40.160> some

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
I was one second my approach to got some

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.920 
I was one second my approach to got some
of<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.490> film's<00:05:40.760> for<00:05:40.970> me<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:41.510> all<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.720> need<00:05:41.810> to

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
of the film's for me so all you need to

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.580 
of the film's for me so all you need to
do<00:05:42.080> is<00:05:42.260> simply<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.710> wine<00:05:42.890> up<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:45.080> two<00:05:45.290> pins

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
do is simply a wine up the the two pins

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.410 
do is simply a wine up the the two pins
I<00:05:45.710> think<00:05:45.890> you<00:05:45.950> can<00:05:46.070> see<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.250> yep<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:46.880> then

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
I think you can see that yep and then

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.510 
I think you can see that yep and then
you<00:05:47.540> just<00:05:47.660> put<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:47.900> new<00:05:47.960> clip<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:51.250> walk<00:05:52.250> in<00:05:52.400> a

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
you just put a new clip and walk in a

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.020 
you just put a new clip and walk in a
place<00:05:52.760> there<00:05:53.150> we<00:05:53.240> go<00:05:53.440> straightforward<00:05:54.440> enough

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
place there we go straightforward enough

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.090 
place there we go straightforward enough
again<00:05:56.110> that's<00:05:57.110> going<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.410> need<00:05:57.530> power<00:05:57.890> so<00:05:58.070> you

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
again that's going to need power so you

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.530 
again that's going to need power so you
can<00:05:58.280> use<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.670> same<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:01.700> same<00:06:01.730> wipes<00:06:02.240> out<00:06:02.510> a

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
can use the same the same wipes out a

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.400 
can use the same the same wipes out a
power<00:06:02.810> one<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.560> dems<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:05.510> simple<00:06:06.200> just

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
power one of the dems and simple just

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.550 
power one of the dems and simple just
plug<00:06:06.620> that<00:06:06.650> into<00:06:06.920> there<00:06:07.190> that<00:06:08.200> just<00:06:09.200> leave<00:06:09.470> it

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
plug that into there that just leave it

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.110 
plug that into there that just leave it
outside<00:06:09.680> every<00:06:10.070> one<00:06:10.190> hand<00:06:10.370> it<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:10.700> then<00:06:10.820> again

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
outside every one hand it and then again

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.870 
outside every one hand it and then again
he<00:06:11.330> just<00:06:11.600> needs<00:06:11.810> us<00:06:11.990> read<00:06:12.410> SATA<00:06:12.710> cable<00:06:13.220> or<00:06:13.370> not

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
he just needs us read SATA cable or not

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.610 
he just needs us read SATA cable or not
don't<00:06:14.000> have<00:06:14.150> to<00:06:14.240> be<00:06:14.330> rich<00:06:14.450> just<00:06:14.900> a<00:06:15.020> SATA<00:06:15.260> cable

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
don't have to be rich just a SATA cable

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.220 
don't have to be rich just a SATA cable
from<00:06:15.830> from<00:06:16.550> that<00:06:16.730> side<00:06:17.000> there<00:06:17.300> and<00:06:17.570> then<00:06:17.900> into

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
from from that side there and then into

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.930 
from from that side there and then into
your<00:06:18.380> SATA<00:06:18.680> parts<00:06:19.130> down<00:06:19.340> there<00:06:19.550> I<00:06:19.580> probably

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
your SATA parts down there I probably

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.120 
your SATA parts down there I probably
put<00:06:20.300> mine<00:06:20.420> in<00:06:20.450> to<00:06:20.600> number<00:06:20.690> one<00:06:21.050> so<00:06:21.860> that's<00:06:22.040> how

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
put mine in to number one so that's how

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.350 
put mine in to number one so that's how
to<00:06:22.250> install<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:23.060> hard<00:06:23.450> drive<00:06:23.720> and<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:25.360> think

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
to install the hard drive and I think

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.490 
to install the hard drive and I think
that's<00:06:26.510> where<00:06:26.690> I've<00:06:26.960> got<00:06:27.110> to<00:06:27.170> at<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:27.470> moment

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
that's where I've got to at the moment

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.910 
that's where I've got to at the moment
obviously<00:06:28.100> from<00:06:28.850> your<00:06:29.360> front<00:06:29.780> of<00:06:29.930> your<00:06:30.110> case

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
obviously from your front of your case

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.820 
obviously from your front of your case
you're<00:06:31.190> gonna<00:06:31.280> have<00:06:31.490> like<00:06:31.700> USB<00:06:32.620> ports<00:06:33.620> and

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
you're gonna have like USB ports and

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.220 
you're gonna have like USB ports and
microphone<00:06:34.490> and<00:06:34.880> things<00:06:35.240> like<00:06:35.390> that<00:06:35.450> and<00:06:35.720> the

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
microphone and things like that and the

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.680 
microphone and things like that and the
power<00:06:36.440> button<00:06:36.860> and<00:06:37.220> the<00:06:37.370> reset<00:06:37.880> born<00:06:38.090> these

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
power button and the reset born these

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.470 
power button and the reset born these
wires<00:06:38.990> simply<00:06:39.470> come<00:06:39.680> with<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:39.950> case<00:06:40.450> one<00:06:41.450> of

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
wires simply come with the case one of

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.320 
wires simply come with the case one of
them<00:06:41.570> is<00:06:41.840> down<00:06:42.080> here<00:06:42.470> and<00:06:42.790> the<00:06:43.790> ones<00:06:44.000> that

them is down here and the ones that

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.590 
them is down here and the ones that
these<00:06:44.780> fight<00:06:45.200> well<00:06:45.620> is<00:06:45.830> it<00:06:45.950> far<00:06:46.160> cool<00:06:46.520> wires<00:06:46.790> or

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
these fight well is it far cool wires or

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.880 
these fight well is it far cool wires or
interview<00:06:47.960> just<00:06:48.110> simply<00:06:48.440> check<00:06:48.710> him

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
interview just simply check him

interview just simply check him
overboard<00:06:49.130> and<00:06:49.520> just<00:06:50.240> see<00:06:50.420> where<00:06:50.570> the<00:06:50.690> plug-in

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
overboard and just see where the plug-in

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.480 
overboard and just see where the plug-in
is<00:06:51.290> pretty<00:06:51.560> much<00:06:51.650> as<00:06:51.830> long<00:06:51.950> as<00:06:52.190> you<00:06:52.280> read<00:06:52.460> what

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
is pretty much as long as you read what

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.030 
is pretty much as long as you read what
you're<00:06:52.790> doing<00:06:53.140> you'll<00:06:54.140> have<00:06:54.530> no<00:06:54.680> problem<00:06:54.950> with

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
you're doing you'll have no problem with

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.980 
you're doing you'll have no problem with
that<00:06:55.070> and<00:06:55.370> then<00:06:56.090> obviously<00:06:56.270> the<00:06:56.540> power<00:06:56.750> for

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
that and then obviously the power for

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.740 
that and then obviously the power for
the<00:06:57.050> motherboard<00:06:57.610> you've<00:06:58.610> got<00:06:58.760> a<00:06:58.790> 24-pin

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
the motherboard you've got a 24-pin

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.310 
the motherboard you've got a 24-pin
connector<00:07:01.210> simply<00:07:02.210> find<00:07:02.450> it<00:07:02.600> where<00:07:02.720> is<00:07:02.870> using

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320 
connector simply find it where is using

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.120 
connector simply find it where is using

your manual again mine's in down obvious
movies<00:07:07.400> cable<00:07:07.820> a<00:07:07.850> second<00:07:16.750> so<00:07:17.750> yeah<00:07:17.900> my<00:07:18.140> 24-pin

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
movies cable a second so yeah my 24-pin

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.360 
movies cable a second so yeah my 24-pin
connector<00:07:19.010> is<00:07:19.670> just<00:07:20.380> down<00:07:21.380> there<00:07:21.920> so<00:07:22.280> you

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
connector is just down there so you

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.480 
connector is just down there so you
simply<00:07:22.550> just<00:07:22.730> check<00:07:23.240> which<00:07:23.390> way<00:07:23.570> goes<00:07:24.490> its

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
simply just check which way goes its

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.640 
simply just check which way goes its
input<00:07:25.820> insert<00:07:26.720> the<00:07:26.870> power<00:07:27.050> until<00:07:27.350> it<00:07:27.440> clicks

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
input insert the power until it clicks

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.590 
input insert the power until it clicks
in<00:07:29.290> there<00:07:30.290> you<00:07:30.500> go<00:07:30.760> so<00:07:31.760> that's<00:07:31.910> that<00:07:32.060> part<00:07:32.390> done

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600 
in there you go so that's that part done
