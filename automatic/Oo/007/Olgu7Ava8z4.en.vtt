will have better performance in terms of

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
will have better performance in terms of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
if we

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.660 
if we
talk<00:02:13.769> about<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.340> know<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:15.540> know<00:02:15.659> over<00:02:16.109> all

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
talk about you know you know over all

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
talk about you know you know over all
aspects<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.819> all<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.120> yes<00:02:18.359> the<00:02:18.540> s6<00:02:18.959> has<00:02:19.049> an

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
aspects and all that yes the s6 has an

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.190 
aspects and all that yes the s6 has an
upper<00:02:19.739> hand<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.189> both<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.730> these<00:02:21.150> devices<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
upper hand on both of these devices and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199 
upper hand on both of these devices and
the<00:02:22.890> only<00:02:23.069> disappointing<00:02:23.640> thing<00:02:23.819> here<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the only disappointing thing here is

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.539 
the only disappointing thing here is
that<00:02:24.239> they<00:02:24.629> are<00:02:24.750> following<00:02:25.109> Apple<00:02:25.890> they're

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
that they are following Apple they're

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.880 
that they are following Apple they're
not<00:02:26.579> you<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.569> make<00:02:27.900> their<00:02:28.140> own<00:02:28.170> design

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
not you know like make their own design

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.599 
not you know like make their own design
and<00:02:29.099> all<00:02:29.189> that<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.389> really<00:02:31.609> the

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
and all that so that is a really the

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.360 
and all that so that is a really the
thing<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.939> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.420> right<00:02:33.450> now<00:02:33.659> so<00:02:34.109> they

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
thing that you can see right now so they

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.190 
thing that you can see right now so they
think<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.609> you<00:02:36.359> know<00:02:36.480> making<00:02:36.719> the<00:02:36.930> device

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
think that you know making the device

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.780 
think that you know making the device
look<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.680> Apple<00:02:38.099> are<00:02:38.219> going<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.459> increase

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
look like Apple are going to increase

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.209 
look like Apple are going to increase
their<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.900> sales<00:02:40.439> their<00:02:40.650> cars<00:02:40.889> and<00:02:41.069> all

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
their you know sales their cars and all

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.399 
their you know sales their cars and all
that<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.689> is<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:44.209> kinda

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
that so that is really a kinda

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.099 
that so that is really a kinda
disappointing<00:02:46.409> but<00:02:47.120> anyways<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.780> will<00:02:48.959> see

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
disappointing but anyways we will see

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.670 
disappointing but anyways we will see
the<00:02:49.230> galaxy<00:02:49.650> s6<00:02:49.919> on<00:02:50.189> march<00:02:50.579> first<00:02:50.970> 2015<00:02:51.959> mwc

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the galaxy s6 on march first 2015 mwc

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.869 
the galaxy s6 on march first 2015 mwc
and<00:02:52.889> HTC<00:02:53.129> One<00:02:53.280> m9<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.760> course<00:02:54.090> pretty<00:02:54.780> soon

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
and HTC One m9 of course pretty soon

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.420 
and HTC One m9 of course pretty soon
which<00:02:56.879> will<00:02:56.909> come<00:02:57.389> in<00:02:57.419> spring<00:02:58.079> 2015<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.310> know

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
which will come in spring 2015 you know

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.349 
which will come in spring 2015 you know
at<00:02:59.639> the<00:02:59.730> same<00:02:59.909> time<00:03:00.829> but<00:03:01.829> of<00:03:02.250> course<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:03.209> we

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
at the same time but of course then we

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.360 
at the same time but of course then we
are<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.719> to<00:03:03.840> see<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.230> real<00:03:04.439> design<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
are going to see the real design and the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.670 
are going to see the real design and the
real<00:03:05.579> deal<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.120> real<00:03:06.689> comparison<00:03:07.169> with<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
real deal and real comparison with the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.539 
real deal and real comparison with the
iphone<00:03:07.980> 6<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> based<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.409> this<00:03:10.590> renders

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
iphone 6 and so based on this renders

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.699 
iphone 6 and so based on this renders
these<00:03:11.849> renders<00:03:12.329> it<00:03:12.540> clearly<00:03:13.049> says<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.349> they

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
these renders it clearly says that they

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.149 
these renders it clearly says that they
are<00:03:13.790> making<00:03:14.790> their<00:03:14.939> phones<00:03:15.269> look<00:03:16.019> like<00:03:16.230> iphone

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
are making their phones look like iphone

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.939 
are making their phones look like iphone
so<00:03:17.459> following<00:03:18.090> iphone<00:03:18.540> designs<00:03:18.870> might<00:03:19.470> not<00:03:19.889> be

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
so following iphone designs might not be

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.530 
so following iphone designs might not be
a<00:03:20.310> good<00:03:20.669> choice<00:03:20.909> there<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:22.970> yes<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.389> quick

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
a good choice there so yes it's a quick

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.439 
a good choice there so yes it's a quick
look<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:25.169> both<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.560> these<00:03:25.829> three<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.609> two
