00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
you can see the flags a little bit

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.780 
you can see the flags a little bit
different<00:04:09.290> there<00:04:09.440> with<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.280> little<00:04:10.459> computer

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
different there with a little computer

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.610 
different there with a little computer
on<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.660> there's<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.930> different<00:04:12.440> game<00:04:12.590> modes

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
on it so there's a different game modes

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.050 
on it so there's a different game modes
now<00:04:13.010> there's<00:04:13.220> also<00:04:13.340> something<00:04:13.579> called<00:04:13.670> gun

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
now there's also something called gun

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.390 
now there's also something called gun
master<00:04:14.299> which<00:04:14.600> i'm<00:04:14.750> not<00:04:14.780> sure<00:04:15.110> what<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.350> is<00:04:15.440> I'm

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
master which i'm not sure what it is I'm

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.620 
master which i'm not sure what it is I'm
interested<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.820> find<00:04:16.940> out<00:04:17.030> what<00:04:17.209> gun<00:04:17.390> master

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
interested to find out what gun master

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.770 
interested to find out what gun master
is<00:04:17.900> now<00:04:18.829> those<00:04:19.010> 25<00:04:19.489> assignments<00:04:20.269> in<00:04:20.359> total<00:04:20.630> now

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
is now those 25 assignments in total now

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.900 
is now those 25 assignments in total now
so<00:04:20.959> i<00:04:20.989> think<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.410> means<00:04:21.500> there's<00:04:22.250> 15<00:04:22.700> new

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
so i think that means there's 15 new

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.040 
so i think that means there's 15 new
ones<00:04:23.090> i'm<00:04:23.240> not<00:04:23.360> too<00:04:23.510> sure<00:04:23.539> of<00:04:23.660> those<00:04:23.810> 10

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
ones i'm not too sure of those 10

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.800 
ones i'm not too sure of those 10
originally<00:04:24.440> or<00:04:24.560> 15<00:04:24.950> so<00:04:25.490> there's<00:04:25.729> a<00:04:25.849> 10<00:04:26.090> or<00:04:26.330> 15

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
originally or 15 so there's a 10 or 15

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.460 
originally or 15 so there's a 10 or 15
new<00:04:27.050> assignments
