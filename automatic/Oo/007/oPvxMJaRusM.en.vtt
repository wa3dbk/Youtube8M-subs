00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:05.359
 welcome to a new video to go to this channel, of course 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.089
 strong francs one says one 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:09.619
 the quake was 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.439
 It has long been announced on the Mac by Steve Jobs of Apple 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.210
 The percent of an App Store should come for programs designed specifically for the Mac 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.920
 Anything with the App Store of iTunes game is already preparing for it 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.869
 still a while with us 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.589
 the same applies now 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.289
 starting today from the date of this video 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.450
 for the maxis themselves and that comes with a software update that is 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:35.999
 Diplomats from 4 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.779
 you look at software updates and then you will 

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:42.270
 it completely downloaded automatic install commitment restart possible 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.600
 So sure or schoolbags has smelled more in Photoshop or Bassumer 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 Has 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.929
 that's your own commission 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.190
 around 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.330
 how to show off the new iTunes like with the TIG necessarily 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.290
 but what the hell is not we had it all now 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.210
 and my old profession always 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.860
 according to Apple itself percent are already just under a thousand euros even over a thousand 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.660
 Programs in the App Store can 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.550
 which you can buy now 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.330
 There is also a lot of stuff the flat rates have 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.159
 around 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.870
 So basically it's app-store again 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.670
 For 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.170
 or in mobile devices 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.630
 as we already see, the whole thing is similar in construction 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.950
 the App Store in iTunes 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.660
 "In my opinion, the whole thing could well be student of his sandals 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.350
 in any case 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.780
 Approach Kate Interface 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.010
 Mesic already 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.820
 Berga delivered better 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 Basically, we are very close to the whole thing ", based on the iPad 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.680
 or to those in Apple's mobile devices went up to 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.189
 individual categories 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:44.990
 percent 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.170
 Purchases from Dec Dominique Rollin top-hits and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.940
 Innsbruck forest because so what is being presented right now by Apple and around 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.040
 otherwise the whole thing should be built or it will dive it basically 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.390
 Ing know no 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.410
 Difference as one from the window 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.390
 at least that is quite the case, that's a pity for me personally 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.420
 because she then out of the window 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.420
 and that is supposed to be time for Melber time and Yahoo 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.569
 for this damage 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.569
 since we had expected more but basically 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.869
 pac-man Santander on the App Store in iTunes 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.349
 So I look at the whole thing that works, of course, with Euro 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.040
 save enters the white volume and its statements around the percent 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.730
 in the Knife Younes the hottest rumor belongs to being his showman 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.699
 thrived 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.699
 the ITB in soft high because electricity 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.149
 to have more than extras us soldiers guard on 1 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.149
 the most perfect German power consumption at the American store 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.230
 and we can and want 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 Arnesen dive difficult 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:47.649
 Sign in 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.919
 the whole merger as I said against Apple 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.229
 on the iTunes 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.699
 you see her water and also counterattack but hardly anything else is already 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:56.619
 gave 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.709
 "Too bad it looks like the whole set-up in the itunes store 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.859
 Gesine above ever larger Bammer is presented at the netbooks 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.069
 we are in Uri and pay attention 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.299
 March is 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.100
 so that as soon as possible 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.249
 we have caused a lot of attention 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.249
 you have to 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.879
 So what you are doing is not quite so serious we take this thing is the new one 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.730
 It is just bold and that will be during the week in any case 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.279
 develop 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:27.899
 and we look says Mattner breathed into buying Engelberts 93 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:28.790
 we see 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.100
 so there is also so Mac OS x led the «selecció» 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.349
 Requirements therefore needs at least 4 for Mac OS x ten points to grow 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.469
 but that needs equipment at all, so now get the app 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.769
 Store 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.379
 nothing is of course enough space the whole will show of constancy 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.789
 so again here again Ebensee sorry to have the rockers all now 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.579
 left her special and we needed to have a cousin website 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.029
 clear 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.439
 he has guys green-black the whole looks then 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.529
 in the folds on the Mac 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.449
 that's what he's called to be the world's number one status, so why? 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.999
 used up 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.260
 End customer experienced 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.580
 we can get the old works so write a convention so everything 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.519
 In iTunes, she has a very small distortion already hard 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.180
 to the App Store benefit reference to the old store 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.889
 he will find his way around really well here 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.050
 unseen teacher be cutting-edge for the social network 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.659
 which I personally like 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.919
 Chisel correctly and I would say where we are with that one ranks here very much 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.430
 lovable of Twitter 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.430
 get your thumbs crossed over the old attachments caches 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.889
 I was valued by Pape Lehmann 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.150
 agree 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.710
 so i have read 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.210
 I recovered quickly 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.410
 and here is ours 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.890
 AP 700 country down a bit 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.389
 Izzeldin veiled and seen Neisse 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.599
 he is summoned and has a new one 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.660
 EPR sinking 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.039
 Meldorf have pages 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.490
 the golf club shot appearances there still like to follow 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.819
 Things to do with it should be calm, it will be exciting ours 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.710
 Miss pace 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.240
 everyone has lost 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.569
 and that's what Fischer looks like for the Mac 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.809
 At first sight, I must say that because I like it in there very well 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.559
 to leaf through these books 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.629
 This is not just a minimum that is currently being created per centimeter 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.589
 Leave a comment so everyone of us will give our all to app-store for 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.039
 Macs and I have to say that we have done very well so far 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.990
 There are a lot of people who said that I personally find it really bad 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.680
 their 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.139
 which of course is clear Apple now has more control than before 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.150
 They see who buys what they are using a little more what 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.089
 Ada criteria also include information the most important 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.529
 also a larger company can be sold 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.319
 Euro or leave everything so can then many consider that at least 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:55.809
 Not 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:59.229
 yes, but of course it is true that she was in the network on what was left 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.869
 also what is interesting what not it is practically business 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.330
 I think you benefited 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.909
 benefit from it and also the circle also gladly times people say what we 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.849
 Therefore I am a very charming idea 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.539
 as I said graphically implemented I still like very little but there will 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.619
 Certainly come out or say little Moosmann get used to it 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.610
 They go back to that and began to see with math who has any questions 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.740
 to the ESC so these stops should be scarce recession anxiety questionnaire 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.889
 decide 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.090
 We will write to you next time and dream
