 with this having a healthier day 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 The first step is to prepare a coffee 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 in the morning that is light but at the same 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 nutritional time and I'll show 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.199
 you the recipe I always make in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.350
 breakfast that is banana tapioca 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.570
 you will need a banana 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.489
 tapioca about 200 grams and is 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 super easy of you to do you just lay 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 all ready and cinnamon to finish to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.650
 give a little taste more 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 with that you already have your super coffee 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
