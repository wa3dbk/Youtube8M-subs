of people want to see that fight these

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.569 
of people want to see that fight these
two<00:00:30.779> guys<00:00:30.929> who<00:00:31.260> each<00:00:31.529> were<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.219> title

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
two guys who each were in title

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.150 
two guys who each were in title
contention<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.899> know<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.890> there

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
contention and you know for a time there

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
contention and you know for a time there
Machida<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.090> thought<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> contender

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
Machida was thought to be the contender

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.139 
Machida was thought to be the contender
and<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> course<00:00:38.100> hendo<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.850> also

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and then of course hendo was also

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
and then of course hendo was also
thought<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> contender<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.290> he<00:00:40.440> got

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
thought to be the contender but he got

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.670 
thought to be the contender but he got
injured<00:00:41.010> last<00:00:41.370> minute<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.840> guess<00:00:43.500> just

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
injured last minute so I guess just

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319 
injured last minute so I guess just
makes<00:00:43.920> sense<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> UFC<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.789> put<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.149> two

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
makes sense for the UFC to put these two

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660 
makes sense for the UFC to put these two
together<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.500> Dan<00:00:46.950> Henderson<00:00:47.190> face

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
together and have Dan Henderson face

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
together and have Dan Henderson face
lyoto<00:00:48.030> machida<00:00:48.410> since<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.309> chill<00:00:50.520> son

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
lyoto machida since you know chill son

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.209 
lyoto machida since you know chill son
is<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.059> getting<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> gig<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.809> now

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
is going to be getting the gig for now

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.459 
is going to be getting the gig for now
so<00:00:53.219> after<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.760> happens<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.629> Jon<00:00:54.930> Jones<00:00:55.140> beats

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so after that happens if Jon Jones beats

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.549 
so after that happens if Jon Jones beats
chill<00:00:56.129> Sonnen<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.960> probably<00:00:58.170> see

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
chill Sonnen then we can probably see

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.220 
chill Sonnen then we can probably see
the<00:00:58.680> winner<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.660> face-off<00:01:00.660> against<00:01:00.989> Jon

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the winner of this face-off against Jon

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.590 
the winner of this face-off against Jon
Jones<00:01:01.469> late<00:01:01.770> summer<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.280> sometime<00:01:02.850> during<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
Jones late summer or sometime during the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.380 
Jones late summer or sometime during the
summertime<00:01:04.080> probably<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> fight<00:01:06.210> will

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
summertime probably so this fight will

probably<00:01:06.930> happen<00:01:07.400> sometime<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> new<00:01:08.790> year

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

probably the first couple months of 2013

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.570 
probably the first couple months of 2013
and<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:13.560> should<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> good<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.490> the

number one contendership obviously I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.249

both<00:01:17.520> guys<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> mean<00:01:18.360> probably<00:01:18.659> deserve

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
both guys I mean probably deserve

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.670

another<00:01:19.710> title<00:01:20.100> fight<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.490> point

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
another title fight at this point

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
another title fight at this point
Machida<00:01:22.680> knocking<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.460> Ryan<00:01:23.729> Bader<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.180> the

Machida knocking out Ryan Bader and the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.910 
Machida knocking out Ryan Bader and the
way<00:01:24.479> he<00:01:24.630> did<00:01:24.869> especially<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.530> Ryan<00:01:25.740> Bader

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
way he did especially when Ryan Bader

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.830 
way he did especially when Ryan Bader
was<00:01:26.040> looking<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.909> mean<00:01:27.060> came<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> win

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
was looking good I mean came off a win

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.539 
was looking good I mean came off a win
probably<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> biggest<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> his<00:01:29.250> career

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
probably the biggest one of his career

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.100 
probably the biggest one of his career
against<00:01:29.790> rampage<00:01:30.270> who<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> best

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
against rampage who was one of the best

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.580 
against rampage who was one of the best
light<00:01:31.409> heavyweights<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.490> sure

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
light heavyweights of all time for sure

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.870 
light heavyweights of all time for sure
and<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.100> knocked<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and just get knocked out like that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
and just get knocked out like that
against<00:01:36.299> Liotta<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.990> amazing<00:01:37.470> pendle<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
against Liotta was amazing pendle on the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.340 
against Liotta was amazing pendle on the
other<00:01:38.549> hand<00:01:38.759> beating<00:01:39.210> Shogun<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.200> was

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
other hand beating Shogun and what was

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
other hand beating Shogun and what was
probably<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.880> best<00:01:42.090> fights<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
probably one of the best fights in the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.649 
probably one of the best fights in the
history<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.290> mixed<00:01:44.159> martial<00:01:44.490> arts<00:01:44.729> period<00:01:45.180> not

just the UFC but mixed martial arts
period<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.119> mean<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> stellar<00:01:49.259> fight

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
period I mean that was a stellar fight

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.060 
period I mean that was a stellar fight
against<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> Shogun<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.750> these<00:01:52.439> two<00:01:52.619> guys<00:01:52.770> going

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
against a Shogun so these two guys going

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
against a Shogun so these two guys going
at<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.340> who<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> win<00:01:54.270> gonna

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
at it who I think is going to win gonna

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.090 
at it who I think is going to win gonna
do<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> prediction<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.680> obviously

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
do a prediction for it so obviously

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
do a prediction for it so obviously
Machida<00:01:56.640> Scott<00:01:57.299> his<00:01:57.540> amazing<00:01:58.110> karate<00:01:58.439> he's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
Machida Scott his amazing karate he's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.219 
Machida Scott his amazing karate he's
got<00:01:58.920> his<00:01:59.040> striking<00:01:59.369> uh<00:01:59.820> does<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.990> some

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
got his striking uh does have some

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.069 
got his striking uh does have some
jujitsu<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:02.009> good<00:02:02.430> counter<00:02:02.850> wrestling<00:02:03.329> really

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
jujitsu as good counter wrestling really

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.230 
jujitsu as good counter wrestling really
really<00:02:04.380> good<00:02:04.590> wrestling<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> striker

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
really good wrestling for for a striker

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.779 
really good wrestling for for a striker
that's<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.630> strong<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.990> he<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> don't

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that's as strong as he is so I don't

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.979 
that's as strong as he is so I don't
think<00:02:09.000> handles<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.599> able<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> take

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
think handles going to be able to take

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.320 
think handles going to be able to take
him<00:02:10.110> down<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.560> easily<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.540> know

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
him down very easily and you know

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.130 
him down very easily and you know
is<00:02:13.600> susceptible<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:15.040> good<00:02:15.970> boxing<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:16.990> saw

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
is susceptible to good boxing and we saw

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.190 
is susceptible to good boxing and we saw
that<00:02:17.170> against<00:02:18.570> Shogun<00:02:19.570> when<00:02:19.720> Shogun<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that against Shogun when Shogun the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.660 
that against Shogun when Shogun the
second<00:02:20.560> fight<00:02:20.710> was<00:02:20.890> able<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.190> land<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.490> right

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
second fight was able to land a right

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.790 
second fight was able to land a right
hook<00:02:21.820> against<00:02:22.270> him<00:02:22.390> knock<00:02:23.020> him<00:02:23.200> down<00:02:23.380> and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
hook against him knock him down and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.950 
hook against him knock him down and
finish<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.400> fight<00:02:24.730> TKO<00:02:25.450> I'm<00:02:25.570> on<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.870> ground

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
finish that fight TKO I'm on the ground

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.400 
finish that fight TKO I'm on the ground
knock<00:02:26.290> him<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.500> um<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.900> could<00:02:29.110> see<00:02:29.290> an

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
knock him out um so we could see an

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.680 
knock him out um so we could see an
h-bomb<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:30.220> possible<00:02:30.760> but<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.300> think<00:02:31.600> it's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
h-bomb it's possible but I think it's

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.020 
h-bomb it's possible but I think it's
going<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.960> hard<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.380> him<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.730> land<00:02:33.730> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
going to be hard for him to land that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.450 
going to be hard for him to land that
also<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> think<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.960> Machida's<00:02:35.830> improves<00:02:36.250> in

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
also I think that Machida's improves in

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.860 
also I think that Machida's improves in
satified<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.880> don't<00:02:37.120> think<00:02:37.330> Machida<00:02:37.630> really

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
satified I don't think Machida really

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.630 
satified I don't think Machida really
looked<00:02:38.050> himself<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.680> fight<00:02:38.890> again

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
looked himself in that fight again

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.460 
looked himself in that fight again
Shogun<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.150> second<00:02:40.480> one<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.780> mean<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.260> first

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
Shogun the second one I mean the first

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.320 
Shogun the second one I mean the first
one<00:02:41.620> obviously<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.760> compare<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
one obviously if you compare the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.470 
one obviously if you compare the
performances<00:02:44.230> between<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.710> two<00:02:44.920> uh

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
performances between the two uh

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.630 
performances between the two uh
definitely<00:02:46.480> uh<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.890> know<00:02:48.010> he<00:02:48.190> did<00:02:48.370> better<00:02:48.550> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
definitely uh you know he did better in

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.030 
definitely uh you know he did better in
the<00:02:48.730> first<00:02:49.000> fight<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.840> when<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.710> comes<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.980> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the first fight so when it comes to the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.530 
the first fight so when it comes to the
h-bomb<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.610> don't<00:02:51.820> think<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.150> really<00:02:52.390> gonna

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
h-bomb I don't think it's really gonna

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.870 
h-bomb I don't think it's really gonna
help<00:02:53.140> end<00:02:53.440> oh<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.590> mean<00:02:53.860> he's<00:02:54.040> got<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.280> chance<00:02:54.670> to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
help end oh I mean he's got a chance to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.270 
help end oh I mean he's got a chance to
land<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:56.050> for<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.740> most<00:02:56.890> part<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.250> think

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
land it but for the most part I think

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.949 
land it but for the most part I think
that<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.880> will<00:02:58.030> probably<00:02:58.270> be<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.540> stand-up

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
that this will probably be a stand-up

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.870 
that this will probably be a stand-up
fight<00:02:59.230> machida<00:02:59.890> using<00:03:00.430> his<00:03:00.550> counter

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
fight machida using his counter

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.670 
fight machida using his counter
wrestling<00:03:01.330> using<00:03:01.690> his<00:03:01.780> good<00:03:01.959> striking<00:03:02.290> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
wrestling using his good striking and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.610 
wrestling using his good striking and
evasive<00:03:03.610> style<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.990> think<00:03:05.050> what<00:03:05.380> she<00:03:05.500> is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
evasive style and I think what she is

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.050 
evasive style and I think what she is
going<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.860> knock<00:03:06.010> out<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.459> no<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.610> really<00:03:06.940> do

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
going to knock out and no I really do

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.790 
going to knock out and no I really do

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
not handle is obviously not an easy

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.380 
not handle is obviously not an easy
gotta<00:03:09.100> knock<00:03:09.370> out<00:03:09.550> i<00:03:09.610> mean<00:03:09.910> he<00:03:10.060> doesn't<00:03:10.120> go

Machida<00:03:27.720> percentages<00:03:28.720> i'd<00:03:28.900> say<00:03:29.110> probably<00:03:29.140> a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
Machida percentages i'd say probably a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.370 
Machida percentages i'd say probably a
60-40<00:03:30.489> maybe<00:03:30.880> sixty<00:03:31.660> five<00:03:31.840> thirty<00:03:32.170> five

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
60-40 maybe sixty five thirty five

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.190 
60-40 maybe sixty five thirty five
percent<00:03:32.410> chance<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.519> trav<00:03:34.420> predicts<00:03:34.930> that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
percent chance I trav predicts that

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.130 
percent chance I trav predicts that
Machida<00:03:36.160> will<00:03:36.580> beat<00:03:36.820> hendo<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.690> we'll<00:03:37.870> get<00:03:37.989> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
Machida will beat hendo and we'll get to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.190 
Machida will beat hendo and we'll get to
see<00:03:38.350> Machida<00:03:38.890> against<00:03:39.610> Jones<00:03:39.910> again<00:03:40.300> granted

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
see Machida against Jones again granted

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.890 
see Machida against Jones again granted
that<00:03:41.459> would<00:03:42.459> be<00:03:42.610> if<00:03:42.760> Jon<00:03:43.239> Jones<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.630> would<00:03:43.780> be

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
that would be if Jon Jones it would be

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.509 
that would be if Jon Jones it would be
chillin<00:03:44.350> which<00:03:44.470> hopefully<00:03:44.680> can't<00:03:45.220> but<00:03:45.459> he

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
chillin which hopefully can't but he

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.990 
chillin which hopefully can't but he
probably<00:03:45.940> will<00:03:46.540> most<00:03:47.290> likely<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:48.459> anyway<00:03:48.760> I

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
probably will most likely so anyway I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.070 
probably will most likely so anyway I
