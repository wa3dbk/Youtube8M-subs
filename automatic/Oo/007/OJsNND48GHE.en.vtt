00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:06.279
 hey nice that you look at one again 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.469
 tutorial of the picasa program 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.630
 today it seems nice to you 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.160
 learn and how to take a black and white photo 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.390
 color accent 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.260
 photo that I clicked on here and 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.510
 has this effect 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.210
 black and white and bit only is colored 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.920
 and often the photo gets the question from 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.530
 how do you do that 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.430
 and picasa you have an option to that 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.460
 to do 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.700
 we are going to do it today with the cloud 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.970
 I have the beautiful ladies cloud here and me 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.610
 click on that photo and you will see it here 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.640
 the options bar that I can do this photo 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.250
 edit with the creative work set the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.770
 click that and before it was one 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.410
 picnic program picnic but that is 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.640
 stopped in April and that was a great pity 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.100
 because we are a lot of fun 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.989
 applications in this program and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 luckily it was put on again 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.440
 under a different name 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.200
 and that is why we can now still in picasa 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.629
 use this fun yes kind 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.850
 piece of program 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.930
 ok i am in here you have some 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 options I choose effects this time 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.860
 and then some very nice ones come 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.360
 frogs in the picture that are all standing 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.360
 for a specific operation 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.760
 I advise you to do all of that 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.430
 just click once if you are in this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 Program is and see what it does 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.760
 and over time if you like the movie 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 works and also learn which frog for 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.520
 which or which name for which 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.049
 application and I know that too 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.810
 what I want to do 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.140
 under black and white she says click that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.909
 and you immediately see my picture 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.860
 now black and white 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.290
 well all i have to do now is 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.600
 put my mouse on the nose because me 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.920
 wants to make the nose red and that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.280
 nose 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.020
 oh on the color so with a mouse click I 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.820
 hold my mouse for one i can 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.880
 not on color I can of course also with 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.729
 adjusting a brush thickness is boring 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.890
 just as big as the nose and in one 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.890
 mouse click I would be ready 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.659
 okay if I had more details here 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.909
 want and then for example a snare 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.810
 then I make something the same moment 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:24.400
 smaller and I go very carefully with 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.049
 my mouse over the bow to make this a whole 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.389
 be able to do exactly 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:32.010
 I advise you to zoom in here 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:36.730
 sit such a man comes for a moment 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 the sun pulls Davies up a little and 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.669
 so can the exactly the edges of that 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.669
 bring back the scarf in that original color 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:49.859
 if I go to because in the hair still 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:55.029
 for a moment we color it was more mine 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:56.409
 brush thickness aside for a moment and me 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:03:03.220
 can be exactly 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:06.960
 make sure the hair doesn't touch okay 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.960
 and in this way I zoom out again 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.740
 and so I see the original photo 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.810
 only one the two red color accents 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.260
 of the nose and a scarf 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.490
 if i want to save this then i need 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.570
 just to say 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.760
 reply and then you keep it here and here 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.740
 then save at the top right 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.790
 picasa 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.860
 but if they do then I say replays or 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.380
 safe new copy I choose this because 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.230
 I also keep the colors there 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.870
 color copy in my picasa 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.720
 then he will produce that and then 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.880
 I'm going back to my program 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.830
 if I go back now to the library 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.000
 then I see that I have the black and white photo here 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.030
 have got 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.860
 and if all goes well, it is still here 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.180
 my color photo 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.120
 well how nice is that look yourself in which 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.510
 photos you can really enjoy this effect 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.580
 and want to know more about it 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.700
 the entire picasa program will look briefly 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.769
 at www point nice viewed point now and 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.650
 courses are given in the area 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:19.419
 ermelo and on request also elsewhere 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.250
 appears after a while and wish you a lot of fun 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.810
