00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.930 

today<00:00:02.860> we're<00:00:03.010> going<00:00:03.159> to<00:00:03.370> look<00:00:03.550> at<00:00:03.730> something

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:03.940 
today we're going to look at something

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.270 
today we're going to look at something
called<00:00:04.090> number<00:00:05.020> patterns<00:00:05.380> and<00:00:05.830> now<00:00:05.980> when<00:00:06.130> we

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.280 
called number patterns and now when we

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.250 
called number patterns and now when we
deal<00:00:06.520> with<00:00:06.550> number<00:00:07.090> patterns<00:00:07.450> we're<00:00:07.900> going<00:00:08.170> to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
deal with number patterns we're going to

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.369 
deal with number patterns we're going to
be<00:00:08.349> asked<00:00:08.800> to<00:00:08.860> find<00:00:09.400> the<00:00:10.059> next<00:00:10.599> set<00:00:10.870> of<00:00:11.019> numbers

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
be asked to find the next set of numbers

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.039 
be asked to find the next set of numbers
in<00:00:11.620> a<00:00:11.919> series<00:00:12.280> of<00:00:12.459> numbers<00:00:12.789> and<00:00:13.030> to<00:00:13.660> do<00:00:13.839> that

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
in a series of numbers and to do that

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.020 
in a series of numbers and to do that
we're<00:00:14.320> going<00:00:14.499> to<00:00:14.619> use<00:00:14.950> one<00:00:15.249> of<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.429> operations

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
we're going to use one of the operations

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.490 
we're going to use one of the operations
of<00:00:16.180> math<00:00:16.390> these<00:00:16.750> are<00:00:16.869> going<00:00:16.960> to<00:00:17.020> be<00:00:17.110> addition

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
of math these are going to be addition

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
of math these are going to be addition
subtraction<00:00:18.099> multiplication<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:19.420> division

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
subtraction multiplication or division

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.169 
subtraction multiplication or division
before<00:00:20.529> we<00:00:20.619> get<00:00:20.740> on<00:00:20.920> to<00:00:21.099> the<00:00:21.220> real<00:00:21.820> number

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
before we get on to the real number

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.679 
before we get on to the real number
patterns

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
patterns

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.810 
patterns
let's<00:00:23.109> look<00:00:23.199> up<00:00:23.320> it<00:00:23.439> here<00:00:23.740> at<00:00:23.920> some<00:00:24.460> shapes

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
let's look up it here at some shapes

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.759 
let's look up it here at some shapes
that<00:00:25.179> also<00:00:25.330> make<00:00:25.599> a<00:00:25.630> pattern<00:00:25.869> now<00:00:26.500> let's<00:00:26.650> see

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
that also make a pattern now let's see

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.950 
that also make a pattern now let's see
we<00:00:26.920> have<00:00:27.099> this<00:00:27.310> blue<00:00:27.669> square<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.300> red<00:00:28.689> triangle

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
we have this blue square a red triangle

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.259 
we have this blue square a red triangle
green<00:00:29.619> circle<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.550> then<00:00:30.669> it<00:00:30.759> comes<00:00:30.910> around

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
green circle and then it comes around

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.390 
green circle and then it comes around
again<00:00:31.419> into<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.990> blue<00:00:32.230> square<00:00:32.470> now<00:00:33.040> let's<00:00:33.220> say<00:00:33.310> I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
again into a blue square now let's say I

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.959 
again into a blue square now let's say I
want<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:33.960> draw<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.500> next<00:00:35.950> two<00:00:36.160> shapes<00:00:36.520> in<00:00:36.850> the

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
want to draw the next two shapes in the

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.450 
want to draw the next two shapes in the
series<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:38.110> I'm<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:38.469> do<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.739> just<00:00:38.950> look

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
series what I'm going to do is just look

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.260 
series what I'm going to do is just look
at<00:00:39.789> the<00:00:40.059> pattern<00:00:40.300> for<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.920> try<00:00:42.219> to<00:00:42.250> guess<00:00:42.910> what

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
at the pattern for and try to guess what

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.170 
at the pattern for and try to guess what
the<00:00:43.420> next<00:00:43.449> two<00:00:44.140> will<00:00:44.320> be<00:00:44.530> based<00:00:45.250> on<00:00:45.520> what<00:00:46.090> has

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
the next two will be based on what has

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.930 
the next two will be based on what has
been<00:00:46.300> given<00:00:46.600> me<00:00:46.690> well<00:00:47.379> I've<00:00:47.500> got<00:00:47.710> blue<00:00:48.219> red

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
been given me well I've got blue red

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.930 
been given me well I've got blue red
green<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.780> goes<00:00:49.960> back<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.350> blue<00:00:50.829> now<00:00:51.820> if

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
green and that goes back to blue now if

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.630 
green and that goes back to blue now if
I<00:00:52.030> look<00:00:52.239> here<00:00:52.960> I<00:00:53.230> know<00:00:53.469> a<00:00:53.620> red<00:00:53.859> triangle<00:00:54.219> came

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
I look here I know a red triangle came

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.540 
I look here I know a red triangle came
after<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.030> blue<00:00:55.149> square<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.739> if<00:00:56.890> this<00:00:57.039> pattern

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
after the blue square so if this pattern

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.970 
after the blue square so if this pattern
is<00:00:57.699> repeating<00:00:58.210> itself<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:59.170> next<00:00:59.350> shape<00:00:59.679> is

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
is repeating itself the next shape is

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.840 
is repeating itself the next shape is
going<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.250> have<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.609> be<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:03.219> red<00:01:03.519> triangle

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
going to have to be this red triangle

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.690 
going to have to be this red triangle
again<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.379> now<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.500> want<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.159> know<00:01:06.400> what<00:01:06.549> the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
again and now I want to know what the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.490 
again and now I want to know what the
next<00:01:07.710> shape<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.950> I'll<00:01:09.700> go<00:01:10.030> back<00:01:10.270> blue<00:01:11.110> red

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
next shape is I'll go back blue red

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.859 
next shape is I'll go back blue red
green<00:01:11.830> blue<00:01:12.580> red<00:01:12.790> well<00:01:13.330> first<00:01:13.630> thing<00:01:13.780> that

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
green blue red well first thing that

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.560 
green blue red well first thing that
comes<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.110> mind<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:16.030> time<00:01:16.180> for<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.420> green

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
comes to mind is it's time for the green

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.960 
comes to mind is it's time for the green
circle<00:01:16.930> again<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:20.829> wanted<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.280> do<00:01:21.430> one<00:01:21.670> more

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
circle again if I wanted to do one more

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.670 
circle again if I wanted to do one more
I'd<00:01:22.210> revert<00:01:22.720> back<00:01:24.299> blue<00:01:25.299> red<00:01:25.720> green<00:01:26.020> blue<00:01:26.470> red

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
I'd revert back blue red green blue red

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.380 
I'd revert back blue red green blue red
green<00:01:27.189> well<00:01:27.939> if<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.090> haven't<00:01:28.329> guessed

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
green well if you haven't guessed

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.800 
green well if you haven't guessed
already<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.900> next<00:01:29.170> shape<00:01:29.350> must<00:01:30.220> be<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.600> blue

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
already the next shape must be the blue

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.700 
already the next shape must be the blue
square<00:01:32.610> again<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.479> now<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.840> was<00:01:35.049> able<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.350> find

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
square again so now I was able to find

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.179 
square again so now I was able to find
the<00:01:36.159> next<00:01:36.700> three<00:01:37.180> shapes<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:38.200> pattern<00:01:38.619> by

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
the next three shapes in this pattern by

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.490 
the next three shapes in this pattern by
looking<00:01:39.700> back<00:01:39.909> at<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.390> pattern<00:01:40.750> coming<00:01:41.290> up

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
looking back at the pattern coming up

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
looking back at the pattern coming up
with<00:01:41.619> an<00:01:41.680> idea<00:01:41.829> of<00:01:42.159> what<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.430> pattern

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
with an idea of what the pattern

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.510 
with an idea of what the pattern
actually<00:01:42.790> was<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.710> I'm<00:01:44.799> moving<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.369> an

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
actually was now I'm moving on to an

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.230 
actually was now I'm moving on to an
actual<00:01:45.670> number<00:01:46.360> pattern<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:48.189> see<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.579> we're

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
actual number pattern we see that we're

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.899 
actual number pattern we see that we're
given<00:01:49.619> 64<00:01:50.670> 32<00:01:51.750> 16<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.049> 8<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:54.820> gonna

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
given 64 32 16 and 8 now it's gonna

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.399 
given 64 32 16 and 8 now it's gonna
require<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.299> little<00:01:55.540> bit<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.930> thinking<00:01:56.140> cuz

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
require a little bit of thinking cuz

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.350 
require a little bit of thinking cuz
I've<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.619> see<00:01:56.770> what<00:01:57.009> these<00:01:57.159> numbers<00:01:57.460> have<00:01:58.329> a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
I've to see what these numbers have a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.410 
I've to see what these numbers have a
common<00:01:59.039> both<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.340> them<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.670> way<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.299> looks

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
common both of them this way it looks

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.340 
common both of them this way it looks
like<00:02:01.659> well<00:02:02.079> 8<00:02:02.380> times<00:02:02.799> 2<00:02:03.219> is<00:02:03.520> 16<00:02:03.939> 16<00:02:04.600> times<00:02:05.079> 2<00:02:05.320> is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
like well 8 times 2 is 16 16 times 2 is

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.350 
like well 8 times 2 is 16 16 times 2 is
32<00:02:05.590> 32<00:02:06.630> times<00:02:07.630> 2<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.259> 64<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.820> would<00:02:09.940> be<00:02:10.030> great

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
32 32 times 2 is 64 that would be great

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
32 32 times 2 is 64 that would be great
if<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.660> was<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:11.110> up

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
if I was going up

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.900 
if I was going up
looks<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.940> I'm<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.620> counting<00:02:13.620> down<00:02:13.910> so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
looks like I'm actually counting down so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.690 
looks like I'm actually counting down so
I'm<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.800> multiplying<00:02:17.460> each

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
I'm going this way was multiplying each

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.200 
I'm going this way was multiplying each
number<00:02:18.000> by<00:02:18.030> two<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.600> bet<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.950> divide<00:02:20.490> by

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
number by two I bet that if I divide by

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.840 
number by two I bet that if I divide by
two<00:02:21.270> each<00:02:21.750> time<00:02:22.250> that's<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.610> give<00:02:23.730> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
two each time that's going to give you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.460 
two each time that's going to give you
the<00:02:23.940> next<00:02:24.150> number<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.780> check<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.230> can

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the next number and I check that I can

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.780 
the next number and I check that I can
do<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.710> math<00:02:25.970> 64<00:02:26.970> divided<00:02:27.630> by<00:02:27.720> 2<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.170> 32<00:02:28.830> 32

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
do that math 64 divided by 2 is 32 32

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.980 
do that math 64 divided by 2 is 32 32
divided<00:02:30.690> by<00:02:30.720> 2<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.530> 16<00:02:32.010> 16<00:02:32.790> divided<00:02:33.090> by<00:02:33.120> 2<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.660> 8

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
divided by 2 is 16 16 divided by 2 is 8

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.760 
divided by 2 is 16 16 divided by 2 is 8
so<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:35.130> found<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> operation<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.440> number

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
so I found the operation in this number

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.160 
so I found the operation in this number
pattern<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.500> dividing<00:02:41.180> by<00:02:42.180> 2<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:43.050> now

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
pattern and it is dividing by 2 so now

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
pattern and it is dividing by 2 so now
to<00:02:43.230> get<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> next<00:02:43.770> three<00:02:44.130> numbers<00:02:44.550> I'm<00:02:44.820> going

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
to get the next three numbers I'm going

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.410 
to get the next three numbers I'm going
to<00:02:45.209> continue<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.050> divide<00:02:46.320> by<00:02:46.500> 2<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.490> 8<00:02:47.820> divided

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
to continue to divide by 2 so 8 divided

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.620 
to continue to divide by 2 so 8 divided
by<00:02:48.570> 2<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:49.050> know<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:50.090> my<00:02:51.090> next<00:02:51.300> number<00:02:51.420> B

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
by 2 we know is for my next number B

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.740 
by 2 we know is for my next number B
comes<00:02:51.810> before<00:02:54.170> or<00:02:55.370> /<00:02:56.370> -<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.980> 2<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.450> 2

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
comes before or / - it's 2 and now 2

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.680 
comes before or / - it's 2 and now 2
divided<00:03:01.350> by<00:03:01.380> 2<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:02.390> 1<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:04.800> was<00:03:05.130> able<00:03:05.400> to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
divided by 2 is 1 so now I was able to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.750 
divided by 2 is 1 so now I was able to
just<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> case<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> shapes<00:03:07.890> was

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
just like in the case of the shapes was

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.630 
just like in the case of the shapes was
able<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> find<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.800> next<00:03:11.459> three<00:03:12.239> numbers<00:03:13.640> in

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
able to find the next three numbers in

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.210 
able to find the next three numbers in
the<00:03:14.910> order<00:03:15.180> by<00:03:15.930> finding<00:03:16.380> which<00:03:16.530> operation<00:03:17.190> I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
the order by finding which operation I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.610 
the order by finding which operation I
need<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.489> use<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> division<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.140> dividing

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
need to use to the division and dividing

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.370 
need to use to the division and dividing
each<00:03:19.769> number<00:03:20.100> by<00:03:20.250> 2<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.180> now<00:03:21.330> look<00:03:21.600> what<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
each number by 2 so now look what is the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.100 
each number by 2 so now look what is the
number<00:03:22.620> pattern<00:03:22.950> here<00:03:23.209> gets<00:03:24.209> divided<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:25.080> half

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
number pattern here gets divided in half

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.280 
number pattern here gets divided in half
or<00:03:25.650> by<00:03:25.950> 2<00:03:26.010> each<00:03:26.549> time<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> same<00:03:27.840> way<00:03:28.110> as

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
or by 2 each time just the same way as

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.090 
or by 2 each time just the same way as
in<00:03:28.530> shapes<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:29.700> repeated<00:03:30.480> based<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.830> order

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
in shapes if repeated based on the order

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.670 
in shapes if repeated based on the order
that<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.459> was<00:03:32.580> given<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.330> example<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
that I was given in the example so the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.490 
that I was given in the example so the
main<00:03:34.830> thing<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.100> remember<00:03:35.190> when<00:03:35.790> finding<00:03:36.500> any

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
main thing to remember when finding any

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.770 
main thing to remember when finding any
type<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.920> pattern<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.209> number<00:03:39.450> pattern

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
type of pattern in a number pattern

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.370 
type of pattern in a number pattern
what's<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.920> operation<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.380> find

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
what's the operation going to be find

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.100 
what's the operation going to be find
the<00:03:43.680> next<00:03:43.980> three<00:03:44.220> steps<00:03:44.519> go<00:03:45.060> back<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.810> check

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
the next three steps go back and check

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.660 
the next three steps go back and check
your<00:03:46.140> work<00:03:46.320> if<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.130> ends<00:03:47.280> up<00:03:47.340> being<00:03:47.400> correct

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
your work if it ends up being correct

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.850 
your work if it ends up being correct
you<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.600> found<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.989> right<00:03:49.080> operation

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
you know you found the right operation

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.350 
you know you found the right operation
and<00:03:50.400> therefore<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.970> right<00:03:51.090> steps

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
and therefore you have the right steps

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.720 
and therefore you have the right steps
as<00:03:51.540> well
