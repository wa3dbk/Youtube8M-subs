00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.940 
I've never seen anything like this
before<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.580> did<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> cowl<00:03:37.270> car<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:38.020> did<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.710> deer

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
before I did the cowl car I did the deer

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.430 
before I did the cowl car I did the deer
car<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:40.000> thought<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> shark<00:03:40.750> car<00:03:41.020> was<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
car and I thought the shark car was the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.130 
car and I thought the shark car was the
best<00:03:41.620> out<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.860> all<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.070> them<00:03:42.390> they're<00:03:43.390> pretty

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
best out of all of them they're pretty

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.080 
best out of all of them they're pretty
strange<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.770> drive<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.310> be<00:03:45.400> honest<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.910> since

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
strange to drive to be honest and since

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.790 
strange to drive to be honest and since
he's<00:03:46.240> not<00:03:46.390> even<00:03:46.690> sitting<00:03:47.170> in<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.350> Cal<00:03:47.560> bear

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
he's not even sitting in the Cal bear

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.470 
he's not even sitting in the Cal bear
and<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.190> days<00:03:48.400> kind<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:48.850> set<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.240> side<00:03:49.450> of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
and the days kind of set on the side of

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.010 
and the days kind of set on the side of
it<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:50.760> probably<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.180> best<00:03:52.360> thing<00:03:52.600> about<00:03:52.660> this

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
it so probably the best thing about this

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.200 
it so probably the best thing about this
mod<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.100> person<00:03:54.520> that<00:03:54.640> made<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:55.000> he

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
mod is the person that made it he

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.760 
mod is the person that made it he
actually<00:03:55.540> did<00:03:55.690> his<00:03:55.810> own<00:03:55.990> version<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.590> Los
