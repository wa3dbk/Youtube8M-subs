separate<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.649> let's<00:02:01.979> get<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.090> separated<00:02:03.979> now

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
separate so let's get them separated now

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.059 
separate so let's get them separated now
they're<00:02:05.250> separated<00:02:05.729> by<00:02:05.880> one

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.509 

and<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.879> just<00:02:13.060> keep<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.519> you

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
and you just keep you on that and you

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.280 
and you just keep you on that and you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
just kind of just kind of shuffled it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:26.729 
just kind of just kind of shuffled it
over<00:02:17.560> there<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:19.470> now<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:20.709> done<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.989> now<00:02:26.650> you

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
over there and now it's done so now you

over there and now it's done so now you
move<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.370> next<00:02:27.519> row<00:02:28.440> once<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.560> get<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
move on to next row once you get the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.380 
move on to next row once you get the
hang<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:32.200> pretty<00:02:32.500> fast<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:36.000> yeah<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
hang of it it's pretty fast but yeah I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.839 
hang of it it's pretty fast but yeah I
mean<00:02:37.690> like<00:02:38.080> me<00:02:38.349> I'm<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> visual<00:02:38.950> learner<00:02:39.160> so

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
mean like me I'm a visual learner so

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.509 
mean like me I'm a visual learner so
just<00:02:40.209> reading<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.720> guides<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.470> really<00:02:42.250> isn't

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
just reading the guides is really isn't

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.990 
just reading the guides is really isn't
enough<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.970> me<00:02:44.220> well<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.549> had<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.700> figure

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
enough for me well I just had to figure

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.660 
enough for me well I just had to figure
this<00:02:46.209> out<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.569> hard<00:02:46.599> way<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:47.110> my<00:02:47.260> own<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.400> got

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
this out the hard way on my own so I got

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.280 
this out the hard way on my own so I got
the<00:02:48.819> hang<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.269> I'm<00:02:49.450> getting<00:02:49.630> pretty<00:02:49.900> lucky

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
the hang of it I'm getting pretty lucky

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.880 
the hang of it I'm getting pretty lucky
with<00:02:50.319> this<00:02:50.560> one<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:52.110> guess<00:02:53.110> which<00:02:53.290> isn't<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.709> good

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
with this one I guess which isn't a good

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.130 
with this one I guess which isn't a good
thing<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> video<00:02:54.760> but<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:58.870> pretty

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
thing for the video but so it's pretty

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.660 
thing for the video but so it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:59.530> see<00:03:00.069> I'm<00:03:00.220> getting<00:03:00.489> real

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
straightforward see I'm getting real

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.569 
straightforward see I'm getting real
lucky<00:03:01.030> everything<00:03:01.450> fat<00:03:01.799> row<00:03:02.799> literally<00:03:03.370> just

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
lucky everything fat row literally just

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.000 
lucky everything fat row literally just
lined<00:03:03.879> up<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.420> these<00:03:05.079> three<00:03:05.379> rows<00:03:05.680> are<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
lined up so these three rows are the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.360 
lined up so these three rows are the
easiest<00:03:06.430> all<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.760> gotta<00:03:06.940> do<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.209> uh<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:09.250> know

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
easiest all you gotta do is uh you know

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.410 
easiest all you gotta do is uh you know
line<00:03:09.790> them<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:12.220> there's<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.760> tough

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420
