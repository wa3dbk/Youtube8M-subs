00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Aarau 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.580
 at the Institute of Lightweight Construction 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.709
 in the ferry port and construct in Stuttgart 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.119
 Engineers and architects are working together on innovative concepts 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.169
 led Colo Gestus build 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.949
 one of their research fields porous plastics and concrete with special 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.949
 properties 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:29.029
 The Stuttgarters are currently developing and testing a luth against concrete 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.830
 Model bones because these are light and yet solid 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.180
 a Kenyan construction Dr. nature 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.440
 that is the goal we pursue 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 that for components reach in the areas of highest stress 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.810
 Poets are an area in which less load occurs 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.050
 The second round goes on trips as well as inside the bone 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290
 such a development could 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.040
 because not only walls but also ceilings would be built up to 20 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 Save percent building weight 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.460
 The lightweight construction can also look like a house transparent and yet never too 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.670
 cold and too hot 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.340
 a house without a chimney when the energy this needs produced 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 even a home for every child 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 that is the vision of Werner succeeding so 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.410
 it's about 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.650
 the 4 Game Monfils 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.870
 Do not rate one hundred percent, especially since the bed is used to create betrayals of construction 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.120
 leave 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.630
 that for us partly in new territory because not yet tried it given 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.510
 I already understand tangible glass panes that can not be touched 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.180
 by liquid crystals 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.040
 switchable glazing the in their energy and translucency 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.260
 are controllable 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.200
 so they can, for example, infrared radiation so Werner 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.900
 filters out 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.510
 Architecture with a view even when it comes to other new building materials 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.299
 this design for a tent-like hall is just an exercise on the way 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.450
 to the new buildings 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.140
 The Stuttgart building researchers also think about houses after those of light 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.180
 Tissues are surrounded instead of thick outer walls 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.619
 November that now could then yes souvenirs of house instead of one 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:22.519
 traditional plastered facade with a facade made of fabric 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.519
 if you remember that you already have such fibers, for example 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.650
 photovoltaics begins to coat so is the selected electricity produce 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.019
 could then be able to become smaller to the houses completely new
