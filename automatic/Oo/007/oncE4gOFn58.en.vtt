00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 chapter 10 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.580
 there are those who dictate unjust laws and 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.559
 they prescribe tyranny to remove the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.150
 trial to the poor and to remove the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.880
 right to the afflicted of my people 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.340
 to strip the widows and rob the 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.830
 orphans and you will stay on the day of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.750
 punishment to whom we will welcome so that 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.420
 I help when he comes by far the 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.210
 Desolation where you will leave your 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.240
 glory without me they will bow down among 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.699
 prisoners and among the dead will fall nor with 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.730
 all this has ceased its fury but it 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.730
 still at your hand is extended or 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.489
 Assyria rod and staff of my wrath in his 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.770
 my position hand I will send you against a 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.290
 lost nation and over the people of my 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.450
 I will send him anger to remove the spoils and 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.030
 snatches prey and puts it to be 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.460
 Found as mud from the streets though 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.500
 he did not think so or his heart what 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.750
 imagine in this way but your 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.450
 thought will be uprooting and cutting 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.989
 nations not a few because he says my 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.689
 princes are not all kings it is not broth 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.689
 as querquennis amad as arafat and 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.320
 Samaria as damask as something my hand 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.510
 the kingdoms 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 the idols being their images more than 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.979
 those of jerusalem and samaria as he says 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.710
 the shammari to his idols does not open also 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.930
 towards jerusalem and its idols but 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.030
 It will happen that after the Lord has 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.790
 finished all his work on Mount Zion 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.160
 and in Jerusalem he will punish the fruit of 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.900
 superb of the heart of the king of Assyria and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.869
 the glory of the haughtiness of his eyes 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.420
 because he said with the power of my hand what 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.820
 I have done and with my wisdom because I have 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.190
 It has been prudent to remove the territories of 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.110
 the peoples and I took out their treasures and 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.780
 knock down as brave those who were 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.180
 seated and I guide my hand like a nest 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.130
 riches of the people and how it is collected 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.440
 in the abandoned eggs like this has 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.479
 rotten of the whole earth and there was no 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.360
 who moved wing or opened mouth and 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.729
 grass born the ax glory against 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.130
 that with it cuts without arrogance will be 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.170
 the saw against which moves it as if 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.300
 the staff picks up the one who lifts it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.000
 as if he lifts he will wash himself who is not 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.489
 This is why the Lord Jehovah of the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.980
 armies in gara weakness over their 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.319
 robust and under his glory will light 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.900
 a bonfire like fire burning 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.599
 and the light of israel will be by fire and its 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.269
 holy by flame that embraces and consumes 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.219
 one day their charges and their thorns the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.280
 glory of its forest and its fertile field 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.290
 consumed totally soul and body and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.870
 will come to be as standard bearer in defeat 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.639
 and the trees that remain in your forest 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.609
 will be the number that a child can 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.590
 tell will happen at that time that 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.150
 those that are left of Israel and the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.430
 that have remained of the house of Jacob 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.709
 never again will they rely on the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 Syrians but they will support themselves with truth 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.109
 in jehovah the saint of israel the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.659
 remnant will return the remnant of Jacob 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.030
 will return to the strong god because if you 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.060
 town or israel will be like the sands 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.829
 of the sea the remnant of the return to the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.319
 destruction agreed to overflow to 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.510
 justice for the Lord Jehovah of the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.090
 armies to the consummation and 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.709
 determined in the middle of the earth by 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.639
 both the lord jehovah of the armies 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.370
 so says my people dweller in Zion shall not 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.319
 Assyrian themes with beloved rod and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.139
 against you he will raise his stick the way 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.310
 from Egypt more from here to very soon 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.099
 it will end in my favor 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.500
 anger for destruction of them and 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.660
 will raise the jehovah of the armies whip 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.120
 against him like the killing of marianna in 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.239
 the rock of gold and he will raise his staff on the 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.620
 sea ​​as he did by way of egypt 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.930
 It will happen at that time that your load 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.510
 it will be removed from your shoulder and your yoke from 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.720
 your service and the yoke will rot because of 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.380
 of the anointing came up to step step up 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.989
 migron enigmas against his army 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.530

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.780

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.810

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.250
 they flee yet the day will come when it will rest in 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.310
 name will raise his hand to the mountain of 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.580
 daughter of Zion to the hill of Jerusalem 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.530

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.810
 tall trees will be cut and 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.910
 the high ones will be humiliated and cut with 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.560
 iron the thicket of the forest and the 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.560
 Lebanon will fall with rumble
