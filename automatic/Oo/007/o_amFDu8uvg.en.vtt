great<00:00:43.170> strength<00:00:43.530> very<00:00:44.040> difficult<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> knock

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
great strength very difficult to knock

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
great strength very difficult to knock
off<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> ball<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.690> guess<00:00:46.070> destroyers<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
off the ball and we guess destroyers in

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.500 
off the ball and we guess destroyers in
their<00:00:47.340> position<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.760> pretty<00:00:48.000> hard<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> stop

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
their position is pretty hard to stop

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
their position is pretty hard to stop
and<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> lot<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> people<00:00:50.399> worked

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and so you know a lot of people worked

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
and so you know a lot of people worked
hard<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.449> ball<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> bottle<00:00:52.079> per

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
hard to get that ball in the bottle per

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
hard to get that ball in the bottle per
second<00:00:52.500> gun<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.250> need<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> create<00:00:53.699> as

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
second gun so they need to create as

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.160 
second gun so they need to create as
well<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.239> lately<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.079> to

finishing<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:57.379> you<00:00:58.379> know

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
finishing and get that and then you know

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
finishing and get that and then you know
sometimes<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.940> can't<00:01:00.239> always<00:01:00.480> play<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> the
