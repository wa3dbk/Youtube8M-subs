pencil looking at pages 26 to 29 I begin
with<00:00:15.780> some<00:00:16.230> warmups<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.010> order<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:17.850> me<00:00:18.000> in

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
with some warmups in order to get me in

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.500 
with some warmups in order to get me in
the<00:00:18.180> mode<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.359> drawing<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:20.279> then<00:00:20.430> once<00:00:21.270> I'm

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the mode of drawing and then once I'm

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.220 
the mode of drawing and then once I'm
warmed<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.230> get<00:00:22.710> straight<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> action

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
warmed up I get straight into the action

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
warmed up I get straight into the action
so<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.590> officer<00:00:26.070> similar<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:27.029> through

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
so the one officer similar just through

get any game face on basically I do a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.100 
get any game face on basically I do a
lot<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.440> ellipses<00:00:41.100> since<00:00:41.460> drawing<00:00:42.270> heads<00:00:42.540> saw

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
lot of ellipses since drawing heads saw

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.670 
lot of ellipses since drawing heads saw
the<00:00:43.170> lips<00:00:43.530> ease<00:00:44.030> I've<00:00:45.030> never<00:00:45.629> done<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> drawing

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the lips ease I've never done a drawing

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.779 
the lips ease I've never done a drawing
where<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> needed<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.120> need<00:00:48.300> ellipses

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
where have it needed to need ellipses

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.939 
where have it needed to need ellipses
there<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.940> massive<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> practice

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
there are massive thing to practice

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.630 
there are massive thing to practice
straight<00:00:52.949> lines<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:55.010> we're<00:00:56.010> working<00:00:56.520> in

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
straight lines as well we're working in

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.060 
straight lines as well we're working in
our<00:00:56.730> draftsmanship<00:00:57.800> skilling<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> up

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
our draftsmanship skilling it up

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
our draftsmanship skilling it up
leveling<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.180> we're<00:01:00.570> trying<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
leveling it up and we're trying to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.250 
leveling it up and we're trying to
really<00:01:01.370> get<00:01:02.370> those<00:01:02.609> core<00:01:03.090> fundamental<00:01:03.899> skills

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
really get those core fundamental skills

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.000 
really get those core fundamental skills
working<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.510> since<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> study

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
working so this is since it is study

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
working so this is since it is study
since<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> practice<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> work

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
since it is practice we're going to work

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
since it is practice we're going to work
on<00:01:10.110> those<00:01:10.229> foundations<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> try<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> include

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
on those foundations and try to include

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.580 
on those foundations and try to include
that<00:01:13.140> along<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.549> more

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
that along with our kind of more

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.150 
that along with our kind of more
observational<00:01:16.590> study

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.600 

so<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.370> start<00:01:22.800> working<00:01:23.800> on<00:01:24.130> our<00:01:24.250> straight

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
so we start working on our straight

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.780 
so we start working on our straight
lines<00:01:24.910> with<00:01:25.630> an<00:01:25.810> A<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.290> B<00:01:26.440> point<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.070> then

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
lines with an A and B point and then

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.300 
lines with an A and B point and then
we're<00:01:27.940> trying<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.470> use<00:01:29.470> our<00:01:29.650> full<00:01:29.890> range<00:01:30.070> of

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
we're trying to use our full range of

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're trying to use our full range of
movement<00:01:30.900> drawing<00:01:31.900> from<00:01:32.020> our<00:01:32.380> elbow<00:01:32.820> left<00:01:33.820> to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
movement drawing from our elbow left to

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.110 
movement drawing from our elbow left to
right<00:01:34.240> oh<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:35.710> you're<00:01:35.980> left-handed<00:01:36.670> it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
right oh if you're left-handed it's

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.410 
right oh if you're left-handed it's
probably<00:01:37.390> going<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.570> be<00:01:37.630> right<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.170> left<00:01:42.420> so

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
probably going to be right to left so

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.150 
probably going to be right to left so
when<00:01:43.660> when<00:01:44.080> you're<00:01:44.230> placing<00:01:44.470> these<00:01:44.800> lines

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
when when you're placing these lines

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.340 
when when you're placing these lines
down<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:46.000> might<00:01:46.210> want<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> do<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.630> few<00:01:46.990> strokes

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
down you might want to do a few strokes

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.310 
down you might want to do a few strokes
without<00:01:48.040> actually<00:01:48.630> pressing<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.930> pants<00:01:50.170> of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
without actually pressing the pants of

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.740 
without actually pressing the pants of
the<00:01:50.470> tablet<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.300> you<00:01:52.420> get<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.720> movement

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
the tablet just so you get the movement

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.500 
the tablet just so you get the movement
right<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.710> then<00:01:54.550> when<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.850> feel<00:01:55.090> it's<00:01:55.300> right

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
right and then when you feel it's right

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.620 
right and then when you feel it's right
you<00:01:55.810> just<00:01:55.960> drop<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.410> down<00:01:59.220> and<00:02:00.450> you'll<00:02:01.450> also

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
you just drop it down and you'll also

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.290 
you just drop it down and you'll also
see<00:02:02.110> me<00:02:02.260> take<00:02:02.440> advantage<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.310> csy<00:02:03.670> feature

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
see me take advantage of the csy feature

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.710 
see me take advantage of the csy feature
I<00:02:04.690> believe<00:02:05.110> it's<00:02:05.290> also<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.860> cs4<00:02:06.520> where<00:02:07.509> you're

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
I believe it's also in cs4 where you're

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.749 
I believe it's also in cs4 where you're
able<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.170> rotate<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.770> page<00:02:08.979> just<00:02:09.369> as<00:02:09.580> if

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
able to rotate the page just as if

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.360 
able to rotate the page just as if
you're<00:02:09.910> working<00:02:10.149> with<00:02:10.360> real<00:02:10.600> paper<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:12.220> way

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
you're working with real paper that way

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.860 
you're working with real paper that way
you<00:02:12.459> can<00:02:12.580> get<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> right<00:02:13.030> angle<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
you can get the right angle for the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.290 
you can get the right angle for the
right<00:02:14.140> Street<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.640> best<00:02:15.850> range<00:02:16.120> of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
right Street and the best range of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.949 
right Street and the best range of
movement<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> hotkey<00:02:19.480> for<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
movement so the hotkey for that I

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:27.600 
movement so the hotkey for that I
believe<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.620> our<00:02:20.980> for<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.820> default<00:02:26.010> I've<00:02:27.010> sped

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
believe is our for the default I've sped

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.000 
believe is our for the default I've sped
up<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.970> footage<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.720> don't<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.530> don't<00:02:29.650> expect

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
up this footage so don't I don't expect

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.550 
up this footage so don't I don't expect
you<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> draw<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.820> fast<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.350> can

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
you to draw this fast but if you can

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.890 
you to draw this fast but if you can
that's<00:02:32.800> great<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> lot<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.030> faces<00:02:37.720> are

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
that's great so a lot of the faces are

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.870 
that's great so a lot of the faces are
drew<00:02:38.230> for<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.620> video<00:02:38.980> we're<00:02:39.310> actually<00:02:39.459> cut

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
drew for this video we're actually cut

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.660 
drew for this video we're actually cut
out<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.840> actually<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.350> fourth

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
out so this is actually the fourth

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.300 
out so this is actually the fourth
revision<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.880> smile<00:02:43.630> expression<00:02:44.320> since

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
revision of the smile expression since

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.039 
revision of the smile expression since
this<00:02:45.459> part<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.940> loomis<00:02:46.269> book<00:02:46.510> does<00:02:46.720> cover

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
this part of the loomis book does cover

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.350 
this part of the loomis book does cover
expressions<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.380> I'm<00:02:50.470> trying<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.860> not<00:02:51.360> just

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
expressions so I'm trying to not just

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.970 
expressions so I'm trying to not just
rush<00:02:52.630> through<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.989> I'm<00:02:53.260> trying<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.769> really

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
rush through it I'm trying to really

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.610 
rush through it I'm trying to really
explore<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.700> expression<00:02:55.330> using<00:02:56.110> different

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
explore the expression using different

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.680 
explore the expression using different
character<00:02:57.040> types<00:02:57.310> whether<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.390> male<00:02:58.630> or

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
character types whether it's male or

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.410 
character types whether it's male or
female<00:02:59.290> then<00:02:59.620> also<00:02:59.769> maybe<00:03:00.489> like<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.850> cute<00:03:01.209> face

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
female then also maybe like a cute face

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.170 
female then also maybe like a cute face
or<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.810> kind<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.560> rugged<00:03:02.769> looking<00:03:03.130> face<00:03:03.400> go<00:03:03.940> get

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
or a kind of rugged looking face go get

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.280 
or a kind of rugged looking face go get
me<00:03:04.330> shotgun<00:03:04.900> Shack<00:03:05.320> donned<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.920> mongrel<00:03:06.250> again

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.930 

so<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.800> construction<00:03:13.430> method<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:13.880> very

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
so the construction method is very

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.540 
so the construction method is very
similar<00:03:14.600> um<00:03:14.780> I'm<00:03:15.590> throwing<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.220> bit<00:03:16.370> more

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
similar um I'm throwing a bit more

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.950 
similar um I'm throwing a bit more
realistic<00:03:16.880> proportions<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:17.870> there<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.810> you

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
realistic proportions in there and you

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.810 
realistic proportions in there and you
can<00:03:21.110> use<00:03:21.350> reference<00:03:21.800> if<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.100> want<00:03:22.310> if<00:03:22.700> you're

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
can use reference if you want if you're

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.130 
can use reference if you want if you're
trying<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.120> really<00:03:23.330> know<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.750> expression

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
trying to really know the expression

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.890 
trying to really know the expression
it's<00:03:24.560> good<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:24.920> look<00:03:25.070> at<00:03:25.250> photos<00:03:26.060> good<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.750> look

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
it's good to look at photos good to look

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.530 
it's good to look at photos good to look
at<00:03:27.140> yourself<00:03:27.470> in<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.010> mirror<00:03:28.180> good<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.330> kind

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
at yourself in the mirror good to kind

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.050 
at yourself in the mirror good to kind
of<00:03:29.630> act<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.960> out<00:03:30.370> even<00:03:31.370> when<00:03:31.460> you<00:03:31.580> sit<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.820> there

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
of act it out even when you sit in there

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.670 
of act it out even when you sit in there
drawing<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.660> know<00:03:32.810> how<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.080> main<00:03:33.380> grin<00:03:33.650> on

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.800 
looking dude had a bit of a man grin on
my<00:03:55.160> face<00:03:55.190> when<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.760> was<00:03:55.880> drawing<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.720> I

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
my face when I was drawing this and I

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.940 
my face when I was drawing this and I
really<00:03:57.710> got<00:03:57.890> into<00:03:57.920> it<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.350> constructions

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
really got into it and the constructions

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.530 
really got into it and the constructions
really<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.460> same<00:04:04.730> as<00:04:04.760> you've<00:04:05.120> seen<00:04:05.330> in<00:04:05.510> the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
really the same as you've seen in the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.810 
really the same as you've seen in the
previous<00:04:05.720> videos<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:06.800> just<00:04:07.010> starting<00:04:07.400> out

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
previous videos it's just starting out

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.150 
previous videos it's just starting out
in<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.210> extra<00:04:08.600> detail<00:04:09.050> it's<00:04:09.680> all<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.980> same

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
in that extra detail it's all the same

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.700 
in that extra detail it's all the same
process<00:04:10.700> it's<00:04:11.000> not<00:04:11.150> hard<00:04:11.500> don't<00:04:12.500> feel

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
process it's not hard don't feel

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.340 
process it's not hard don't feel
intimidated<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.670> this<00:04:14.420> is<00:04:14.630> sped<00:04:14.930> up<00:04:15.080> once

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
intimidated and this is sped up once

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.530 
intimidated and this is sped up once
again<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.520> know<00:04:16.670> take<00:04:16.910> your<00:04:17.120> time<00:04:17.330> with<00:04:17.480> it

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
again so you know take your time with it

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.960 
again so you know take your time with it
and<00:04:17.900> if<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.739> doesn't<00:04:19.100> look<00:04:19.220> right<00:04:19.430> destroy<00:04:19.910> it

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and if it doesn't look right destroy it

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.330 
and if it doesn't look right destroy it
again<00:04:20.270> a<00:04:20.510> lot<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:20.989> these<00:04:21.109> what<00:04:21.950> you're<00:04:22.130> seeing

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
again a lot of these what you're seeing

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.940 
again a lot of these what you're seeing
are<00:04:22.820> actually<00:04:23.660> on<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.930> screen<00:04:24.230> is<00:04:24.440> more<00:04:24.680> bits

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
are actually on the screen is more bits

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.040 
are actually on the screen is more bits
assessors<00:04:25.580> actually<00:04:26.150> cut<00:04:26.420> out<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.660> lot<00:04:26.870> of

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
assessors actually cut out a lot of

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.500 
assessors actually cut out a lot of
failures<00:04:27.260> out<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.890> video<00:04:28.130> i<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:29.120> deleted

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
failures out of the video i just deleted

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.350 
failures out of the video i just deleted
them<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.170> redrew<00:04:30.980> them<00:04:31.160> anyway<00:04:34.360> so

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
them and redrew them anyway so

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120 
them and redrew them anyway so
expressions<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.230> really<00:04:36.620> fun<00:04:36.860> one<00:04:37.070> to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
expressions is a really fun one to

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.430 
expressions is a really fun one to
explore<00:04:37.760> especially<00:04:38.630> if<00:04:38.720> you've<00:04:38.900> got<00:04:39.140> a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
explore especially if you've got a

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.190 
explore especially if you've got a
character<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.280> you're<00:04:40.520> developing<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.270> it

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
character that you're developing and it

through<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.960> characters<00:04:54.500> expression<00:04:55.160> and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
through the characters expression and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.000 
through the characters expression and
also<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.420> you're<00:04:56.540> able<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:57.080> consistently

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
expressions and it's more fun to look at

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.010 
expressions and it's more fun to look at
really<00:05:06.530> rather<00:05:06.920> than<00:05:07.160> just<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.760> know<00:05:07.910> a
