all right I want to do a quick review I

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.249 
all right I want to do a quick review I
was<00:00:04.799> gonna<00:00:05.040> do<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> unboxing<00:00:05.370> but<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.509> video

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
was gonna do a unboxing but this video

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.750 
was gonna do a unboxing but this video
converter<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.799> you're<00:00:07.919> looking<00:00:08.189> at<00:00:08.340> it

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
converter that you're looking at it

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.180 
converter that you're looking at it
basically<00:00:09.269> comes<00:00:09.750> with<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.380> piece<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
basically comes with this piece and the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.150 
basically comes with this piece and the
power<00:00:11.370> adapter<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:13.110> really<00:00:13.469> too<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.679> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
power adapter so not really too much to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.910 
power adapter so not really too much to
unbox<00:00:14.610> I'll<00:00:15.240> put<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.470> name<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
unbox I'll put the the name and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.650 
unbox I'll put the the name and
description<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:17.880> basically<00:00:18.029> what

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
description in it but basically what

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.920 
description in it but basically what
this<00:00:18.690> tool<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.789> basically<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.420> converter

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
this tool is it's basically a converter

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.740 
this tool is it's basically a converter
from<00:00:22.289> composite<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> composite<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
from composite you see the composite I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.500 
from composite you see the composite I
can<00:00:25.609> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.670> focus<00:00:28.160> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> composite<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
can kind of focus it's a composite to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.340 
can kind of focus it's a composite to
HDMI<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.669> goes<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.149> composite<00:00:33.809> comes<00:00:34.110> out

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
HDMI so it goes in composite comes out

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.069 
HDMI so it goes in composite comes out
HDMI<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.790> you're<00:00:36.210> probably<00:00:36.360> asking<00:00:36.660> yourself

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
HDMI so you're probably asking yourself

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.590 
HDMI so you're probably asking yourself
okay<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.530> use<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.600> back

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
okay what do you use this for well back

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.040 
okay what do you use this for well back
here<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> roxio<00:00:41.370> game<00:00:41.489> capture<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
here I have a roxio game capture and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.729 
here I have a roxio game capture and
that's<00:00:43.350> HDMI<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.870> component<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.289> HDMI

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that's HDMI in component with an HDMI

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.270 
that's HDMI in component with an HDMI
out<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.180> lot<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.690> may<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.739> Apollo

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
or even the elgato or even avermedia

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.770 
or even the elgato or even avermedia
this<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.649> allow<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.250> record<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.360> retro

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
consoles such as Nintendo Super Nintendo

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.030 
consoles such as Nintendo Super Nintendo
Sega<00:01:01.410> Genesis<00:01:02.420> panasonic<00:01:03.420> 3do<00:01:03.809> Nintendo<00:01:04.589> 64

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
Sega Genesis panasonic 3do Nintendo 64

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.510 
Sega Genesis panasonic 3do Nintendo 64
Playstation<00:01:06.409> etc<00:01:07.409> basically<00:01:07.680> everything

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
Playstation etc basically everything

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
Playstation etc basically everything
that<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:08.850> composite<00:01:09.450> input<00:01:09.830> Nepal<00:01:10.830> has

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that has composite input Nepal has

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
that has composite input Nepal has
actually<00:01:11.520> problems<00:01:12.000> where<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.780> has<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
actually problems where it has the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
actually problems where it has the
inputs<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.640> doesn't<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.090> well<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
inputs but it it doesn't do well and it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.100 
inputs but it it doesn't do well and it
starts<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> basically<00:01:16.770> scramble<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.790> signal

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
starts to basically scramble the signal

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
starts to basically scramble the signal
so<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.220> converts<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
so what this does is it converts a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.590 
so what this does is it converts a
composite<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.200> HDMI<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
composite to HDMI out and this thing is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.880 
composite to HDMI out and this thing is
awesome<00:01:24.780> I'll<00:01:25.080> hook<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> elgato

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
awesome I'll hook this up to the elgato

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.940 
awesome I'll hook this up to the elgato
I<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:27.390> much<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.380> got<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
awesome it took me a little while to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
awesome it took me a little while to
configure<00:01:55.320> because<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> Roxio

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
configure because with the Roxio

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850 
configure because with the Roxio
software<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:57.990> saying<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> signal<00:01:58.710> was

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
software and I was saying the signal was

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.670 
software and I was saying the signal was
protected<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> wouldn't<00:02:00.990> let<00:02:01.110> me<00:02:01.200> record<00:02:01.530> it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
protected so I wouldn't let me record it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.109 
protected so I wouldn't let me record it
was<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.850> try<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
was kind of like you know if you try to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.980 
was kind of like you know if you try to
do<00:02:03.329> HDMI<00:02:04.729> out<00:02:05.729> from<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> players<00:02:06.420> PlayStation

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
do HDMI out from the players PlayStation

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.309 
do HDMI out from the players PlayStation
3<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:08.429> basically<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.569> had<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.170> keep

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
3 so basically I had to just keep

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.960 
3 so basically I had to just keep
resetting<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.030> taking<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.330> USB
