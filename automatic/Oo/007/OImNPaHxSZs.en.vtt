guys will enjoy that going on in the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.290 
guys will enjoy that going on in the
background<00:00:46.289> well<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.399> chose<00:00:47.760> hard<00:00:48.030> point

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
background well we also chose hard point

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
background well we also chose hard point
as<00:00:48.420> well<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.289> black<00:00:49.620> ops<00:00:49.860> 2

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
as well because it's a black ops 2

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
as well because it's a black ops 2
specific<00:00:50.489> game<00:00:50.700> mode<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.300> wouldn't<00:00:51.510> be

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
specific game mode so we wouldn't be

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.970 
specific game mode so we wouldn't be
able<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> play<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> any<00:00:52.320> other<00:00:52.469> card<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
able to play this and any other card so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
able to play this and any other card so
I<00:00:53.010> thought<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> good<00:00:53.550> choice<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.789> well

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
I thought to be a good choice as well

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
I thought to be a good choice as well
and<00:00:54.690> even<00:00:55.020> though<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.320> raid<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> mean<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and even though it is raid I mean it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
and even though it is raid I mean it's
not<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> same<00:00:57.090> 200-plus<00:00:57.899> stuff

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
not like it's the same 200-plus stuff

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
not like it's the same 200-plus stuff
PDW<00:00:58.890> silence<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.579> least<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.030> you're

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
PDW silence at least so you know you're

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
PDW silence at least so you know you're
seeing<00:01:00.780> every<00:01:01.320> part<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> mat<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
seeing every part of the mat not just a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
seeing every part of the mat not just a
Dom<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> swarm<00:01:04.049> running<00:01:04.409> down<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.830> entire

couple weeks or months obj well we've
decided<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.220> ghost<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.880> getting<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.270> little

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
decided that ghost is getting a little

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.360 
decided that ghost is getting a little
stale<00:02:52.690> we've<00:02:53.020> been<00:02:53.170> uploading<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.770> same<00:02:54.010> game

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
stale we've been uploading the same game

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.310 
stale we've been uploading the same game
plans<00:02:54.640> for<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:54.910> guys<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> lot<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.750> crank<00:02:55.990> scams

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
plans for you guys a lot of crank scams

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.050 
plans for you guys a lot of crank scams
and<00:02:56.530> double<00:02:56.860> kem<00:02:57.040> strikes<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.610> gun<00:02:57.760> streaks

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and double kem strikes and gun streaks

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.790 
and double kem strikes and gun streaks
so<00:02:58.540> we<00:02:58.630> thought<00:02:58.660> we'd<00:02:58.960> vary<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.380> up<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.680> bring

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
so we thought we'd vary it up and bring

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.440 
so we thought we'd vary it up and bring
in<00:02:59.920> some<00:03:00.130> new<00:03:00.160> cons<00:03:00.580> if<00:03:00.760> that's<00:03:00.910> all<00:03:01.060> right<00:03:01.090> I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
in some new cons if that's all right I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.820 
in some new cons if that's all right I
know<00:03:01.720> we've<00:03:01.900> been<00:03:01.930> uploading<00:03:02.410> some<00:03:02.530> World

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
know we've been uploading some World

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.290 
know we've been uploading some World
Records<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.400> modern<00:03:03.640> warfare<00:03:03.670> 3<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.120> black

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
Records in modern warfare 3 and black

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.790 
Records in modern warfare 3 and black
ops<00:03:04.510> 2<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.930> think<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.380> time<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:05.560> some

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
ops 2 I think it's time for some

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.740 
ops 2 I think it's time for some
gameplays<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.520> know<00:03:06.880> we<00:03:07.090> were<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.240> huge<00:03:07.570> and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
gameplays I know we were a huge and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.240 
gameplays I know we were a huge and
support<00:03:08.110> when<00:03:08.320> we<00:03:08.410> launched<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.740> channel<00:03:09.130> I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
support when we launched a channel I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.070 
support when we launched a channel I
think<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:09.820> might<00:03:10.060> actually<00:03:10.300> go<00:03:10.690> back<00:03:10.870> onto

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
think we might actually go back onto

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.170 
think we might actually go back onto
older<00:03:11.590> cons<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.040> maybe<00:03:12.100> even<00:03:12.400> ghosts<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.000> run

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
older cons and maybe even ghosts and run

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.580 
older cons and maybe even ghosts and run
a<00:03:13.210> few<00:03:13.390> support<00:03:13.780> games<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.080> if<00:03:14.260> that's<00:03:14.410> all

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
a few support games but if that's all

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.710 
a few support games but if that's all
right<00:03:14.620> with<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.980> guys<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.580> I'll<00:03:16.240> let<00:03:16.390> us<00:03:16.510> know

guys<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:19.000> all<00:03:19.090> right<00:03:19.300> with<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.510> because<00:03:19.720> I

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
guys are all right with that because I

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.780 
guys are all right with that because I
know<00:03:19.930> it's<00:03:20.140> very<00:03:20.260> controversial<00:03:21.040> oh<00:03:21.370> my<00:03:21.580> god

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
know it's very controversial oh my god

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.120 
know it's very controversial oh my god
your<00:03:22.030> spawn<00:03:22.390> trapping<00:03:22.750> but<00:03:23.140> uh<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.590> think<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.100> lot

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
your spawn trapping but uh I think a lot

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.430 
your spawn trapping but uh I think a lot
of<00:03:24.250> people<00:03:24.370> found<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.880> entertaining<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.510> it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
of people found it entertaining and it's

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.770 
of people found it entertaining and it's
what<00:03:26.680> made<00:03:26.950> us<00:03:27.070> huge<00:03:27.370> essentially<00:03:28.000> yeah<00:03:28.750> I

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
what made us huge essentially yeah I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.510 
what made us huge essentially yeah I
mean<00:03:29.110> ghost<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.620> kind<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> slow<00:03:30.190> paced<00:03:30.430> game

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
mean ghost is kind of a slow paced game

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.940 
mean ghost is kind of a slow paced game
overall<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> think<00:03:32.080> support<00:03:32.590> will<00:03:32.709> make<00:03:32.830> it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
overall so I think support will make it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.990 
overall so I think support will make it
a<00:03:33.010> little<00:03:33.130> bit<00:03:33.310> more<00:03:33.430> entertaining<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.970> watch

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
a little bit more entertaining to watch

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.270 
a little bit more entertaining to watch
because<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.810> know<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.380> hard<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.770> make<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.950> solo

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
because I know it's hard to make a solo

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.180 
because I know it's hard to make a solo
game<00:03:36.490> play<00:03:36.760> like<00:03:37.000> really<00:03:37.600> fast<00:03:37.870> paced<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.530> go

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
game play like really fast paced and go

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.970 
game play like really fast paced and go
so<00:03:39.900> it's<00:03:40.900> not<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.170> we're<00:03:41.320> all<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.800> only

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
so it's not like we're all the only

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.110 
so it's not like we're all the only
thing<00:03:42.100> we're<00:03:42.190> going<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.340> be<00:03:42.459> uploading<00:03:43.000> a

thing we're going to be uploading a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.690 
thing we're going to be uploading a
support<00:03:43.540> ghost<00:03:43.890> we're<00:03:44.890> gonna<00:03:45.010> be<00:03:45.070> doing<00:03:45.280> solo

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
support ghost we're gonna be doing solo

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
generally no not just purely gameplays

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.060 
generally no not just purely gameplays
or<00:03:58.120> purely<00:03:58.750> support<00:03:59.440> game<00:03:59.620> place<00:03:59.860> you<00:03:59.980> know

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
or purely support game place you know

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.110 
or purely support game place you know
we're<00:04:00.220> still<00:04:00.370> gonna<00:04:00.459> have<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.700> mix<00:04:00.970> of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
we're still gonna have a mix of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.300 
we're still gonna have a mix of
everything<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.320> think<00:04:02.530> that'll<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:02.920> you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
everything and I think that'll just you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.830 
everything and I think that'll just you
know<00:04:03.459> it'll<00:04:03.700> be<00:04:03.760> better<00:04:04.000> for<00:04:04.090> everyone<00:04:04.270> even

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
know it'll be better for everyone even

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.710 
know it'll be better for everyone even
if<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.020> don't<00:04:05.170> necessarily<00:04:05.320> like<00:04:05.830> support<00:04:06.720> it

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
if you don't necessarily like support it

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.449 
if you don't necessarily like support it
sound<00:04:08.200> like<00:04:08.260> it's<00:04:08.440> gonna<00:04:08.530> be<00:04:08.650> our<00:04:08.739> main<00:04:08.950> focus

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
sound like it's gonna be our main focus

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.610 
sound like it's gonna be our main focus
or<00:04:09.580> anything<00:04:09.790> like<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:09.940> so<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:11.560> you

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
or anything like that so I think you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.590
