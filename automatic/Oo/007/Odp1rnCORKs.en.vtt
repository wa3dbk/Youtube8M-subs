want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> call<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.520> over<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
want to call it it's over here by the

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.529 
want to call it it's over here by the
pier<00:00:27.600> but<00:00:28.640> since<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:29.939> far<00:00:30.269> away<00:00:30.359> I'm

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
pier but since it's so far away I'm

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.370 
pier but since it's so far away I'm
taking<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.930> airplane<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.930> on<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.110> fast

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
taking this airplane so on my fast

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920 
taking this airplane so on my fast
forward<00:00:34.970> going<00:00:35.970> through<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> air<00:00:36.570> because

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
forward going through the air because

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
forward going through the air because
this<00:00:37.620> airplane<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.489> slow

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this airplane is actually pretty slow

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.920 
this airplane is actually pretty slow
but<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.090> know<00:00:41.120> it's<00:00:42.120> cooler

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:01:09.649 

so<00:00:45.680> let's<00:00:46.040> get<00:00:46.220> going<00:01:04.449> come<00:01:05.449> on

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.450 

uh<00:01:10.289> I'd<00:01:10.829> say<00:01:10.890> four<00:01:11.780> um<00:01:13.189> circumstances<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.340> was

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
uh I'd say four um circumstances I was

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.520 
uh I'd say four um circumstances I was
pretty<00:01:14.729> good<00:01:14.819> landing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
pretty good landing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.840 
pretty good landing
considering<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.679> mission<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.670> did

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
considering the mission that I just did

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.819 
considering the mission that I just did
I<00:01:17.880> failed<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.619> 20<00:01:19.619> times<00:01:21.170> roughly<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.439> 20

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
I failed about 20 times roughly about 20

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.649 
I failed about 20 times roughly about 20
times<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.579> hope<00:01:23.789> this<00:01:23.969> jump<00:01:24.329> does<00:01:24.479> not

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
times I really hope this jump does not

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.440 
times I really hope this jump does not
kill<00:01:24.959> me<00:01:28.520> alright<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:32.179> there's<00:01:33.179> a<00:01:33.240> lifeguard

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
kill me alright so there's a lifeguard

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910 
kill me alright so there's a lifeguard
that's<00:01:34.259> interesting

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that's interesting

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
that's interesting
and<00:01:36.950> there's<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.219> truck<00:01:38.549> unfortunately<00:01:39.539> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and there's the truck unfortunately it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.089 
and there's the truck unfortunately it
does<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.349> a<00:01:41.750> hitch<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.049> ball<00:01:43.829> hitch

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
does not have a hitch on it ball hitch

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.959 
does not have a hitch on it ball hitch
so<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.429> cannot<00:01:44.819> tow<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.929> sea-doos<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.969> this

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
so you cannot tow the sea-doos or this

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.300 
so you cannot tow the sea-doos or this
boat<00:01:48.299> trailer<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:49.679> backing<00:01:49.920> up

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
boat trailer with it just by backing up

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
boat trailer with it just by backing up
I'm<00:01:50.819> not<00:01:51.030> sure<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.629> an<00:01:51.750> upgrade

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
I'm not sure if it's in an upgrade

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.899 
I'm not sure if it's in an upgrade
either

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
either

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
either
so<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:57.000> trucks<00:01:57.360> exact<00:01:57.750> location<00:01:58.379> is<00:01:58.619> right

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so the trucks exact location is right

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.520 
so the trucks exact location is right
next<00:01:59.069> to<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.399> two<00:01:59.579> Ferris<00:01:59.939> wheels<00:02:00.319> in<00:02:01.319> the
