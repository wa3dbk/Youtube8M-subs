00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.470
 what is this saying 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.470
 this your breath 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.640
 things will return to the norm 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.640
 I think about going back to school 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.560
 school because we tell ourselves that we will use 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.330
 our last year together and it was me 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.410
 it happened nickname for us the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.410
 quartet of me 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.480
 like we can think of another 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 is 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.729
 with us but 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.880
 with my girlfriend 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.140
 that you tell me you will go back to Switzerland or 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.140
 something like that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.740
 these popular laughs 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.400
 the next 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.400
 those of the school tomÃ¡s 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.569
 but I had 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.460
 but 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.930
 in the fearsome quartet and have our 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.930
 Name (s 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.590
 and that nothing either 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.479
 match over me 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.750
 to dry and the scalp laughing 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.280

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.520
