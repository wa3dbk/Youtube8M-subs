00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
just giving me justice because really my

it thinks I am giving it any smart
treatment<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.600> top<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> my<00:02:07.020> hair

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
like a4a

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.809 
like a4a
that<00:02:11.739> my<00:02:12.670> hair<00:02:12.909> is<00:02:12.939> just<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.540> soft<00:02:13.870> at<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.109> top

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
that my hair is just so soft at the top

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.899 
that my hair is just so soft at the top
my<00:02:15.819> curls<00:02:16.239> or<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:17.200> curling<00:02:17.499> up<00:02:17.829> my<00:02:18.489> way<00:02:18.670> users

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
my curls or just curling up my way users

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.989 
my curls or just curling up my way users
are<00:02:19.090> popping<00:02:19.629> even<00:02:19.900> more<00:02:20.109> or<00:02:20.769> whatever<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.579> I

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
are popping even more or whatever and I

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.520 
are popping even more or whatever and I
think<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.359> is<00:02:22.510> what's<00:02:22.749> causing<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.230> frizz

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
think that is what's causing the frizz

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.709 
think that is what's causing the frizz
and<00:02:23.920> me<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.819> probably<00:02:25.120> needing<00:02:25.540> to

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
and me really probably needing to

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.520 
and me really probably needing to
retwist<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.499> much<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.859> I<00:02:27.010> am<00:02:27.340> retwisting

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
retwist this much as I am retwisting

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.860 
retwist this much as I am retwisting
because<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.829> am<00:02:30.239> spritzing<00:02:31.239> my<00:02:31.389> hair<00:02:31.659> with

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
because I am spritzing my hair with

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.160 
because I am spritzing my hair with
water<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.590> much<00:02:33.599> I'm<00:02:34.599> not<00:02:34.780> having<00:02:35.139> that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
water so much I'm not having that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.679 
water so much I'm not having that
problem<00:02:35.620> at<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.250> back<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.700> mean<00:02:36.879> yes<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.359> am

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
problem at the back I mean yes I am

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.069 
problem at the back I mean yes I am
getting<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:39.489> wild<00:02:39.909> hairs<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.749> the<00:02:40.900> loose

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
getting the wild hairs and the loose

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.909 
getting the wild hairs and the loose
hairs<00:02:41.879> but<00:02:42.879> that's<00:02:43.090> typical<00:02:43.359> where<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.709> still

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:44.919 
hairs but that's typical where it still

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.789 
hairs but that's typical where it still
doesn't<00:02:45.370> look<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.579> bad<00:02:45.939> as<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.510> top<00:02:46.719> in<00:02:47.500> my

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
doesn't look that bad as the top in my

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.099 
doesn't look that bad as the top in my
opinion<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.669> though<00:02:49.389> you<00:02:49.449> probably<00:02:49.810> still

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
opinion and though you probably still

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.319 
opinion and though you probably still
saying<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:50.650> doesn't<00:02:50.739> look<00:02:51.010> bad<00:02:51.069> but<00:02:51.549> again<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
saying it doesn't look bad but again the

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.439 
saying it doesn't look bad but again the
cameras<00:02:52.689> giving<00:02:52.959> me<00:02:53.049> justice<00:02:53.469> I<00:02:53.590> promise<00:02:53.919> you

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
cameras giving me justice I promise you

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.780 
cameras giving me justice I promise you
so<00:02:55.449> I<00:02:55.780> come<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.739> conclusion<00:02:56.889> that<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
so I come to that conclusion that the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.020 
so I come to that conclusion that the
water<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:59.139> know<00:02:59.400> my<00:03:00.400> hair<00:03:00.609> is<00:03:00.730> just<00:03:00.760> too

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
water is you know my hair is just too

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.869 
water is you know my hair is just too
soft<00:03:01.239> at<00:03:01.449> the<00:03:01.599> top<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.260> do<00:03:02.409> something<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:03.280> i<00:03:03.549> am

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
soft at the top to do something so i am

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.050 
soft at the top to do something so i am
going<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.209> eliminate<00:03:04.870> missing<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.949> water<00:03:06.189> on

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
going to eliminate missing the water on

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.300 
going to eliminate missing the water on
my<00:03:07.209> hair<00:03:07.419> every<00:03:07.569> day<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:08.560> what<00:03:08.769> gave<00:03:09.010> me<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
my hair every day and what gave me the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.770 
my hair every day and what gave me the
idea<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:10.379> do<00:03:11.379> so<00:03:11.819> because<00:03:12.819> i've<00:03:13.180> heard<00:03:13.419> several

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
idea to do so because i've heard several

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.589 
idea to do so because i've heard several
other<00:03:14.079> Locker<00:03:14.439> say<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:15.129> I<00:03:15.180> cannot<00:03:16.180> read

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
other Locker say that I cannot read

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.289 
other Locker say that I cannot read
different<00:03:17.259> blogs<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.949> different<00:03:18.849> websites

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
different blogs and different websites

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.319 
different blogs and different websites
that<00:03:19.599> are<00:03:20.280> water<00:03:21.280> helps<00:03:21.639> your<00:03:21.790> hair<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.120> lock

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
that are water helps your hair to lock

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.319 
that are water helps your hair to lock
faster<00:03:22.659> so<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> figured<00:03:24.099> you<00:03:24.250> know<00:03:24.370> spish<00:03:25.180> my

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
faster so I figured you know spish my

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.199 
faster so I figured you know spish my
hair<00:03:25.540> every<00:03:26.409> day<00:03:26.439> before<00:03:26.919> my<00:03:27.639> hair<00:03:27.879> a<00:03:27.909> lot

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
hair every day before my hair a lot

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.869 
hair every day before my hair a lot
faster<00:03:28.509> but<00:03:29.470> I'm<00:03:29.590> thinking<00:03:29.979> in<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.280> case

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
faster but I'm thinking in that case

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.300 
faster but I'm thinking in that case
most<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.479> them<00:03:31.599> were<00:03:31.750> meaning<00:03:32.259> that<00:03:32.919> that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
most of them were meaning that that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.490 
most of them were meaning that that
maybe<00:03:33.549> they<00:03:33.819> rinse<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.389> hair<00:03:34.419> or<00:03:34.900> wash<00:03:35.229> your

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
maybe they rinse the hair or wash your

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.939 
maybe they rinse the hair or wash your
hair<00:03:35.709> once<00:03:36.669> a<00:03:36.849> week<00:03:37.030> or<00:03:37.209> once<00:03:37.269> every<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:38.829> know

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
hair once a week or once every you know

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.449 
hair once a week or once every you know
two<00:03:39.220> weeks<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.769> not<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.919> way<00:03:42.040> I'm<00:03:42.220> still

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
two weeks and not the way I'm still

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.659 
two weeks and not the way I'm still
doing<00:03:42.699> it<00:03:42.879> so<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.810> probably<00:03:44.530> am<00:03:44.859> going<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.430> still

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
doing it so I probably am going to still

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.390 
doing it so I probably am going to still
continue<00:03:45.909> to<00:03:46.419> express<00:03:46.930> my<00:03:47.169> hair<00:03:47.409> maybe<00:03:47.620> once
