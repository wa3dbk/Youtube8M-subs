once you've used the file to tie this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.330 
once you've used the file to tie this
cross<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:19.050> turn<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.830> other<00:02:19.980> side

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
cross we turn it on to the other side

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.440 
cross we turn it on to the other side
and<00:02:21.239> do<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> same<00:02:22.489> I'm<00:02:23.489> going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> wet<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> q-tip
