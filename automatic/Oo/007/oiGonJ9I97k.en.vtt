00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
over-the-air updates which is an

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.140 
over-the-air updates which is an
improvement<00:00:29.859> over<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.490> last<00:00:30.519> controller

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
improvement over the last controller

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.630 
improvement over the last controller
which<00:00:31.630> required<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.320> micro<00:00:32.740> USB<00:00:32.770> connection

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
which required a micro USB connection

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.000 
which required a micro USB connection
for<00:00:33.880> updates<00:00:34.270> it's<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:35.110> good<00:00:35.260> feature<00:00:35.500> but

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
for updates it's a good feature but

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.610 
for updates it's a good feature but
that's<00:00:36.190> more<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.550> technical<00:00:36.730> fix<00:00:37.620> comparing

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
that's more of a technical fix comparing

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.170 
that's more of a technical fix comparing
the<00:00:38.739> two<00:00:38.920> controllers<00:00:39.309> they<00:00:39.789> look<00:00:40.030> identical

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
the two controllers they look identical

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.959 
the two controllers they look identical
with<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.989> exception<00:00:41.079> of<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.710> new<00:00:41.890> ports<00:00:42.309> the

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
with the exception of the new ports the

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.729 
with the exception of the new ports the
most<00:00:43.180> obvious<00:00:43.570> advancement<00:00:44.109> is<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.350> addition

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
most obvious advancement is the addition

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.369 
most obvious advancement is the addition
of<00:00:44.800> 3.5<00:00:45.609> millimeter<00:00:46.059> audio<00:00:46.420> port<00:00:46.750> which<00:00:47.199> will

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
of 3.5 millimeter audio port which will

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.049 
of 3.5 millimeter audio port which will
let<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.620> connect<00:00:47.949> any<00:00:48.100> standard<00:00:48.640> headphones

no matter how crazy they look and

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.220 
no matter how crazy they look and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
that the Xbox one bumpers felt good for

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.490 
that the Xbox one bumpers felt good for
clicking<00:01:07.060> but<00:01:07.540> actually<00:01:07.900> holding<00:01:08.320> them<00:01:08.470> down

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
clicking but actually holding them down

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.520 
clicking but actually holding them down
felt<00:01:09.010> difficult<00:01:09.460> due<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.850> push<00:01:10.210> back

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
felt difficult due to the push back

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.140 
felt difficult due to the push back
although<00:01:11.530> they<00:01:11.710> look<00:01:11.920> identical<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.820> push

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
although they look identical the push

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.730 
although they look identical the push
back<00:01:13.360> has<00:01:13.570> been<00:01:13.750> reduced<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.380> these<00:01:14.530> new

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
back has been reduced on these new

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.230 
back has been reduced on these new
controllers<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.670> can<00:01:15.790> definitely<00:01:16.090> hear

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
controllers and you can definitely hear

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.820 
controllers and you can definitely hear
an<00:01:16.360> audible<00:01:16.570> difference

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.929 

testing<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.950> out<00:01:28.009> with<00:01:28.189> sunset<00:01:28.610> overdrive

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
testing it out with sunset overdrive

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.940 
testing it out with sunset overdrive
it's<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.750> great<00:01:29.960> option<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.380> be<00:01:30.590> able<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.740> have

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
it's a great option to be able to have

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.590 
it's a great option to be able to have
headphones<00:01:31.189> plugged<00:01:31.790> into<00:01:31.970> my<00:01:32.180> controller

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
headphones plugged into my controller

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.109 
headphones plugged into my controller
and<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.259> sounds<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:33.619> fine<00:01:33.909> you'll<00:01:34.909> most

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
and it sounds just fine you'll most

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.450 
and it sounds just fine you'll most
likely<00:01:35.210> get<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.600> best<00:01:35.899> audio<00:01:36.259> over<00:01:36.530> HDMI<00:01:37.220> or

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
likely get the best audio over HDMI or

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.520 
likely get the best audio over HDMI or
optical<00:01:38.000> but<00:01:38.540> that's<00:01:38.720> not<00:01:38.930> an<00:01:39.049> option<00:01:39.409> for

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
optical but that's not an option for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.190 
optical but that's not an option for
everyone<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.909> bumpers<00:01:41.270> feel<00:01:41.570> better<00:01:41.840> but

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
everyone the bumpers feel better but

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.230 
everyone the bumpers feel better but
it's<00:01:42.320> not<00:01:42.409> exactly<00:01:42.670> game-changing<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
it's not exactly game-changing the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's not exactly game-changing the
players<00:01:44.539> who<00:01:44.750> would<00:01:44.840> notice<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.409> most<00:01:45.649> are

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
players who would notice is the most are

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.990 
players who would notice is the most are
the<00:01:46.009> ones<00:01:46.190> who<00:01:46.310> would<00:01:46.369> probably<00:01:46.789> play

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
the ones who would probably play

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.910 
the ones who would probably play
shooters<00:01:47.420> competitively<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.320> those<00:01:48.649> players

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
shooters competitively and those players

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.130 
shooters competitively and those players
are<00:01:49.130> more<00:01:49.280> likely<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.729> use<00:01:50.060> an<00:01:50.240> Xbox<00:01:50.539> elite

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
are more likely to use an Xbox elite

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.889 
are more likely to use an Xbox elite
controller<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.759> controller<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.390> still<00:01:53.630> great

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
controller the controller is still great

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.990 
controller the controller is still great
so<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.229> gets<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.470> good<00:01:54.500> rating<00:01:54.979> for<00:01:55.189> me<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:55.880> as

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
so it gets a good rating for me but as

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.969 
so it gets a good rating for me but as
an<00:01:56.179> upgrade<00:01:56.690> for<00:01:56.929> those<00:01:57.110> who<00:01:57.259> already<00:01:57.409> own<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
an upgrade for those who already own the

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.950 
an upgrade for those who already own the
