00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
any will you leave for black Americans I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.859 
any will you leave for black Americans I
would<00:01:46.399> like<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.820> believe<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.360> if<00:01:47.479> we<00:01:47.630> have<00:01:47.659> a

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
would like to believe that if we have a

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.230 
would like to believe that if we have a
freer<00:01:48.289> Society<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:49.220> will<00:01:49.430> take<00:01:49.909> care<00:01:50.180> of

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
freer Society it will take care of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.389 
freer Society it will take care of
blacks<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.080> whites<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.530> everybody<00:01:51.950> equally

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
blacks and whites and everybody equally

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.969 
blacks and whites and everybody equally
because<00:01:53.119> we're<00:01:53.330> all<00:01:53.539> individuals<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.860> me

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
because we're all individuals and to me

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.550 
because we're all individuals and to me
that<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:55.549> important<00:01:56.149> but<00:01:56.720> if<00:01:56.840> we<00:01:56.960> had<00:01:57.170> equal

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
that is so important but if we had equal

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.200 
that is so important but if we had equal
justice<00:01:57.830> under<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.369> law<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.789> think<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.090> would

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
justice under the law I think it would

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.880 
justice under the law I think it would
be<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.360> big<00:01:59.539> improvement<00:01:59.689> if<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.380> had<00:02:00.679> a

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
be a big improvement if we had a

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.960 
be a big improvement if we had a
probably<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.909> repeal<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.750> most<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.170> federal

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
probably a repeal of most of the federal

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.149 
probably a repeal of most of the federal
laws<00:02:04.970> on<00:02:05.299> drugs<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.170> unfairness<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.950> how

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
laws on drugs and the unfairness on how

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.400 
laws on drugs and the unfairness on how
blacks<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.759> treated<00:02:08.209> with<00:02:08.630> these<00:02:08.869> drug<00:02:09.200> laws

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
blacks are treated with these drug laws

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.440 
blacks are treated with these drug laws
it<00:02:09.619> would<00:02:09.739> be<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.890> tremendous<00:02:10.100> improvement<00:02:11.090> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
it would be a tremendous improvement and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.509 
it would be a tremendous improvement and
also<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.350> think<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.010> if<00:02:13.100> you're<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
also I think that if you're going to

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.500 
also I think that if you're going to
have<00:02:13.670> prosperity<00:02:14.299> it<00:02:14.690> serves<00:02:15.019> everybody<00:02:15.860> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
have prosperity it serves everybody and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.830 
have prosperity it serves everybody and
if<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.260> done<00:02:18.470> by<00:02:19.299> emphasizing<00:02:20.299> property

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
if this is done by emphasizing property

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.660 
if this is done by emphasizing property

the<00:02:26.690> military-industrial<00:02:27.440> complex<00:02:28.340> doesn't

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
the military-industrial complex doesn't

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.400 
the military-industrial complex doesn't
suck<00:02:28.940> away<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.750> wealth<00:02:30.019> of<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.380> country

economists<00:03:14.310> has<00:03:14.489> studied<00:03:14.879> this<00:03:15.000> extensively

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
economists has studied this extensively

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.069 
economists has studied this extensively
and<00:03:15.959> he<00:03:16.709> has<00:03:16.799> found<00:03:17.129> that<00:03:17.450> prior<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.659> a<00:03:18.720> minimum

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
and he has found that prior to a minimum

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.289 
and he has found that prior to a minimum
wage<00:03:19.260> laws<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.129> no<00:03:20.400> discrepancy<00:03:21.090> like

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
wage laws there was no discrepancy like

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.690 
wage laws there was no discrepancy like
this<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:21.689> he<00:03:21.840> put<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.379> lot<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:22.980> blame<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.579> the

this so he put a lot of blame on the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.250 
this so he put a lot of blame on the
minimum<00:03:23.939> wage<00:03:24.060> law<00:03:24.480> once<00:03:24.719> government<00:03:25.139> gets

opportunities and I believe there is a

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.309 
opportunities and I believe there is a

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
lot of truth to this because it

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.050 
lot of truth to this because it

I haven't supported am the state I also

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.540 
I haven't supported am the state I also
think<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.450> it's<00:04:55.900> pretty<00:04:56.290> impractical<00:04:56.890> to

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
think that it's pretty impractical to

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.810 
think that it's pretty impractical to
get<00:04:58.420> an<00:04:58.540> army<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.830> country<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.400> round<00:05:00.640> up

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
get an army in this country to round up

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.660 
get an army in this country to round up
12<00:05:01.150> or<00:05:01.390> maybe<00:05:01.570> 20<00:05:02.020> million<00:05:02.770> but<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.070> do<00:05:03.190> believe

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
12 or maybe 20 million but I do believe

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.370 
12 or maybe 20 million but I do believe
that<00:05:03.880> we<00:05:04.000> have<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.330> stick<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.780> our<00:05:04.810> guns<00:05:05.110> on

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
that we have to stick to our guns on

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.160 
that we have to stick to our guns on
obeying<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.980> law<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.550> anybody<00:05:07.420> who<00:05:07.750> comes<00:05:07.960> in

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
obeying the law and anybody who comes in

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.410 
obeying the law and anybody who comes in
here<00:05:08.380> illegally<00:05:09.100> shouldn't<00:05:09.460> be<00:05:09.550> rewarded<00:05:10.240> and

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
here illegally shouldn't be rewarded and

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.350 
here illegally shouldn't be rewarded and
that<00:05:11.170> would<00:05:11.350> be<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.530> case<00:05:11.680> but<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.610> see<00:05:13.030> the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
that would be the case but I see the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.330 
that would be the case but I see the
immigration<00:05:13.930> problem<00:05:14.290> is<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.440> consequence<00:05:15.100> of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
immigration problem is a consequence of

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.850 
immigration problem is a consequence of
our<00:05:15.520> welfare<00:05:15.790> state<00:05:16.330> welfare<00:05:17.110> because<00:05:17.530> we
