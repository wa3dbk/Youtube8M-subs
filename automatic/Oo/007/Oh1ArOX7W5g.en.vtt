you think they're they're going at the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.420 
you think they're they're going at the
moment<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.170> knew<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.250> Sri

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
moment what we knew that going to Sri

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.769 
moment what we knew that going to Sri
Lanka<00:00:17.460> would<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:17.940> very<00:00:18.119> difficult<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.630> has

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
Lanka would be very difficult it has

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.720 
Lanka would be very difficult it has
been<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.410> long<00:00:19.439> time<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
been for a long time I think the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.769 
been for a long time I think the
conditions<00:00:20.910> there<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> real<00:00:21.750> challenge

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
conditions there are a real challenge

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.720 
conditions there are a real challenge
for<00:00:22.470> any<00:00:22.590> professional<00:00:23.189> player<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
for any professional player to go and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.130 
for any professional player to go and
play<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.539> Sri<00:00:24.660> Lankans<00:00:24.990> are

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
play in and the Sri Lankans are

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
play in and the Sri Lankans are
particularly<00:00:25.560> adept<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.130> playing<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.519> their

particularly adept at playing in their
home<00:00:26.820> conditions<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.500> England<00:00:28.800> have

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
home conditions so you know England have

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
home conditions so you know England have
found<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.310> tough<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.849> thought<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.480> had<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
found it tough I thought they had a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.200 
found it tough I thought they had a
great<00:00:31.019> first<00:00:31.320> day<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> series

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
great first day of the series

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.580 
great first day of the series
voluntarily<00:00:33.210> incorrect<00:00:33.450> 488<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
voluntarily incorrect 488 and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
voluntarily incorrect 488 and
unfortunately<00:00:35.399> didn't<00:00:35.700> manage<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> quite

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
unfortunately didn't manage to quite

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.220 
unfortunately didn't manage to quite
capitalize<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.340> enough<00:00:38.760> and

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
capitalize that on that enough and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.180 
capitalize that on that enough and
therefore<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> match<00:00:40.800> managed<00:00:41.100> to

therefore you know the match managed to
you<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.399> turned<00:00:41.760> around<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> great

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
found ourselves one kneel down and that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.619 
found ourselves one kneel down and that
was<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> great<00:00:47.399> shame<00:00:47.610> everyone<00:00:48.239> looked<00:00:48.450> at

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
was a great shame everyone looked at

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240

Matai<00:00:49.079> before<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> series<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.980> said<00:00:50.100> he'll

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
Matai before the series and said he'll

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.380 
Matai before the series and said he'll
be<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> difference<00:00:50.789> he<00:00:50.879> took<00:00:51.030> wickets<00:00:51.300> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
be the difference he took wickets in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
be the difference he took wickets in
that<00:00:51.539> first<00:00:51.750> type<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.980> keys

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that first type of see I think the keys

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.619 
that first type of see I think the keys
been<00:00:53.460> night<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> Sri<00:00:54.329> Lankan<00:00:54.420> batsman

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
been night when the Sri Lankan batsman

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
been night when the Sri Lankan batsman
had<00:00:54.960> got<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> they've<00:00:55.890> made<00:00:56.100> hundreds<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> big

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.279 
had got in they've made hundreds of big
hundreds<00:00:57.090> which<00:00:57.480> England<00:00:57.780> haven't<00:00:58.020> done<00:00:58.140> yet

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
hundreds which England haven't done yet

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.680 
hundreds which England haven't done yet
have<00:00:58.500> there<00:00:58.710> yes<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.460> that<00:01:00.090> does<00:01:00.329> stand

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
have there yes I think that does stand

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
have there yes I think that does stand
out<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.199> fact<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.879> once<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.940> Sri<00:01:03.120> Lankans

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
they've looked at that long and that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
they've looked at that long and that
they've<00:01:13.560> built<00:01:13.830> their<00:01:14.100> innings<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:15.030> calm

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
they've built their innings in very calm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
they've built their innings in very calm
way<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.100> good<00:01:17.250> partnerships<00:01:17.820> all<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
way and had good partnerships all the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.350 
way and had good partnerships all the
way<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:19.110> their<00:01:19.320> order<00:01:19.970> England<00:01:20.970> whilst

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
way down down their order England whilst

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.399 
way down down their order England whilst
I<00:01:21.479> think<00:01:21.659> something<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> batsmen<00:01:22.320> have

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I think something the batsmen have

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
I think something the batsmen have
played<00:01:22.560> extremely<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.009> taking<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.580> Bell<00:01:23.729> for

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
played extremely well taking in Bell for

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.490 
played extremely well taking in Bell for

in<00:02:12.310> England<00:02:12.610> candor<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.120> think<00:02:13.420> Kingdom<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:13.930> you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
in England candor I think Kingdom do you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.110 
in England candor I think Kingdom do you
have<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> combative<00:02:14.680> side<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.310> there's<00:02:16.000> lots

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
have a combative side and there's lots

and I think you're going to need eight

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.260 
and I think you're going to need eight
or<00:02:19.930> nine<00:02:20.170> guys<00:02:20.440> playing<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.820> their<00:02:21.940> potential

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
or nine guys playing to their potential

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.750 
or nine guys playing to their potential
to<00:02:22.690> really<00:02:23.590> put<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> pressure<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.610> Sri

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
