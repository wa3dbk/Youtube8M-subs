recorded the leaf drop I amplified the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320 
recorded the leaf drop I amplified the
sound<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.890> loads<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.459> then<00:02:35.000> changed

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the pitch and I actually turned out

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.250 
the pitch and I actually turned out
pretty<00:02:36.890> cool<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.120> yeah<00:02:38.269> just<00:02:38.569> do<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:39.050> stuff

know don't ask me I was used by this

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.759 
know don't ask me I was used by this
logic<00:03:05.150> would<00:03:05.930> determine<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.410> would<00:03:06.500> be<00:03:06.590> just

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
logic would determine that would be just

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.470 
logic would determine that would be just
new<00:03:06.980> sound<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.519> then<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.790> know<00:03:07.880> GDX<00:03:08.269> files

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
new sound and then you know GDX files

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.880 
new sound and then you know GDX files
