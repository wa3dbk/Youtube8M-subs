hey buddy this is my second attempt to
germinate<00:00:03.570> some<00:00:03.840> elements<00:00:04.370> so<00:00:05.370> first<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.000> took

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
germinate some elements so first I took

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.570 
germinate some elements so first I took
some<00:00:06.480> elements<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.680> soaked<00:00:08.010> them<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
some elements and I soaked them for a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.589 
some elements and I soaked them for a
few<00:00:09.090> days<00:00:09.740> within<00:00:10.740> three<00:00:10.980> days<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.509> daily<00:00:12.509> I

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
few days within three days and daily I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.799 
few days within three days and daily I
was<00:00:12.900> changing<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> water<00:00:14.360> two<00:00:15.360> times<00:00:15.599> at

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
was changing the water two times at

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.160 
was changing the water two times at
least

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
least

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.720 
least
and<00:00:17.270> then<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:19.100> buried<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.430> elements<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
and then I buried these elements in a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
and then I buried these elements in a
soil<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.680> moisture

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
soil with a little little bit moisture

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.900 
soil with a little little bit moisture
don't<00:00:27.750> give<00:00:27.960> too<00:00:28.140> much<00:00:28.320> water<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.510> after

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
don't give too much water and after

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.580 
don't give too much water and after
almost<00:00:32.989> three<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.260> half<00:00:34.500> month<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.610> just

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
see some elements here and these roots

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.910 
see some elements here and these roots
are<00:01:03.840> coming<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.129> box<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.760> just

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.160 

leaves<00:02:30.280> are<00:02:30.489> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.790> come<00:02:30.970> from<00:02:31.090> here

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.539 

this<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:36.090> apricot<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.769> these<00:02:39.220> are<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
this is apricot and these are the

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.320 
this is apricot and these are the
Almonte<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.150> didn't<00:02:41.970> grow<00:02:42.970> properly

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
Almonte that didn't grow properly

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.620 
Almonte that didn't grow properly
actually<00:02:43.750> even<00:02:44.230> proof<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.799> have<00:02:44.950> have<00:02:45.280> got

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
actually even proof you have have got

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.759 
actually even proof you have have got
fungus<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.810> actually<00:02:47.140> they<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.319> got<00:02:47.560> rotten

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
fungus and actually they have got rotten

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.339 
fungus and actually they have got rotten
actually<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:48.970> avoiding<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.450> fungus<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.110> have

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
actually for avoiding the fungus I have

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.160 
actually for avoiding the fungus I have
put<00:02:50.620> some<00:02:50.920> neem<00:02:51.250> oil<00:02:51.459> actually<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.900> can

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
put some neem oil actually you can

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.009 
put some neem oil actually you can
figure<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.709> what<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> NEMA<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:58.440> actually<00:02:59.440> so

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
figure out what the NEMA is actually so

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.900 
figure out what the NEMA is actually so
this<00:03:02.019> tree<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.440> found<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:02.890> India<00:03:03.220> actually<00:03:04.350> yes

you can use so yeah so it has given
around<00:03:20.590> fifty<00:03:20.920> percent<00:03:20.950> germination<00:03:21.340> for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
around fifty percent germination for

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.340 
around fifty percent germination for
