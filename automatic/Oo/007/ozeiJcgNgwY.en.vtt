00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.469
 ae 

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:14.599
 was champion and the youtube era were 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.080
 a lot and aims at a video of the channel that 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.390
 is tired of channel 10 897 and the video of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.089
 today a different video tutorial and that 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.189
 I see that many people ask for many 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.359
 people have trouble knocking mistakes 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.990
 in fifa 14 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.390
 and for who played fifa 13 and knew 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.660
 How do you hit the same line 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.850
 same thing same thing has nothing 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 different and clear we are here in 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.160
 arena to do in this tutorial and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.590
 he b in the spectacular sensational mine 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.530
 this player however a gallery or 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.040
 next three things you have to 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.140
 to worry first the player 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.710
 distance in fact primarily to the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.000
 distance between the player and a module is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.570
 It'll be even shorter, let's pick this up. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.030
 distance to standard 24 meters 24 meters 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.580
 To leave the player is him and in the way we are 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.340
 I had already spoken and the O's here 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.890
 specifications - the following power 88 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.370
 and has a good potential for kicks 88 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.980
 default curve 84 then 24 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.900
 meters a strong beating player is 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.680
 illegal on this floor you control the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.390
 kick 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.940
 something else has to worry that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.800
 as I said the barrier a way 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.550
 how you will position it is that your 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.920
 player 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.240
 so the photo here on the left then you 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.130
 You have to worry about the last 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.430
 player of the left barrier that has 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.960
 there closer to the right goalpost 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.000
 So you look at him, look at the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.550
 lock and arrange that your player 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.130
 You leave the next you do not 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.690
 so very close and not far away leaves 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.790
 at this distance more or less 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.350
 near the beam 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.810
 else you have to do the following 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.780
 I'll let the adin control and the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.369
 you have to press is the people I 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.070
 with ball for who kicks 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.700
 square will use the square tightens the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.590
 left analog at the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.989
 will be moving people let 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.900
 retinha can not move 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.700
 press up and press the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.110
 kick in my ball case 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.080
 when you finish 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.120
 then you release the left analog button 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.000
 so let's go there left analog stick 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.990
 up leaves it 's uncle and pushes the button 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 to kick 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.940
 this distance two bars with this 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 player here more or less players who 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.230
 They kick a power 80 92 bars 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.480
 excellent then look there the almost 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.640
 of the barrel that have already passed if exactly 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.340
 almost two belly's great we go 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.860
 fill two bars there 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.580
 the ball went near anything that has 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.470
 to worry that it is exactly with the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.420
 analog tight up to the grip 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.670
 The ball is going to go to hell. Come on. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.270
 almost two bars the ball hit the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.580
 barrier 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.530
 so you get tempted several times that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.930
 one hour you will get it right if you choose 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.670
 player do you play in multimeeting 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.730
 player of his team and is training with 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.250
 it the best way to beat a bernard I 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.570
 two bars is spectacular, let 's go 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.020
 try to make the goal that is a little 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.320
 This hurts here, it was very weak, but it's okay. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.209
 watching the ball always passed by like 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.620
 now put a little closer, right? 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:28.280
 little closer closer with two 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.610
 exact bars aped put up almost 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.260
 two bars the ball exploded on the crossbar 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.630
 so that's right chicken does not have 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.450
 secret no hitting foul at the end 14 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.799
 you have to worry about how you 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.010
 organisms right here 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.260
 oprah kick the player and clear the sinning 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.390
 always logical up and the bar of the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.370
 On the side he has to worry about her 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.280
 ball goes on the beam even with two more 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.470
 bars because he's in the 88th foul 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.360
 so the fault will always be dangerous 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.239
 so that's right it would be this was ours
