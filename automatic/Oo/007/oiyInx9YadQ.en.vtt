00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.970 

here's<00:00:02.060> a<00:00:02.150> great<00:00:02.570> little<00:00:02.870> how-to<00:00:03.170> that<00:00:03.590> I<00:00:03.620> have

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:03.980 
here's a great little how-to that I have

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.100 
here's a great little how-to that I have
going<00:00:04.250> a<00:00:04.640> lot<00:00:05.180> of<00:00:05.300> the<00:00:05.420> parts<00:00:05.750> that<00:00:05.960> they

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.110 
going a lot of the parts that they

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.250 
going a lot of the parts that they
reproduce<00:00:06.350> out<00:00:06.860> there<00:00:07.130> are<00:00:07.430> just<00:00:07.929> kind<00:00:08.929> of<00:00:09.019> bad

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
reproduce out there are just kind of bad

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.790 
reproduce out there are just kind of bad
things

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
things

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.370 
things
I<00:00:09.920> mean<00:00:10.160> cosmetically<00:00:10.940> they<00:00:11.090> look<00:00:11.330> good<00:00:11.599> but

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
I mean cosmetically they look good but

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.740 
I mean cosmetically they look good but
the<00:00:12.889> function<00:00:13.400> of<00:00:13.519> them<00:00:13.639> just<00:00:13.910> isn't<00:00:14.240> there

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
the function of them just isn't there

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.540 
the function of them just isn't there
and<00:00:14.990> one<00:00:15.440> of<00:00:15.470> those<00:00:15.650> parts<00:00:16.039> that<00:00:16.129> they<00:00:16.309> make

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
and one of those parts that they make

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.669 
and one of those parts that they make
out<00:00:16.730> there<00:00:16.970> is<00:00:17.239> a<00:00:17.269> reproduction<00:00:18.019> voltage

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:18.679 
out there is a reproduction voltage

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.759 
out there is a reproduction voltage
regulator<00:00:19.220> for<00:00:19.699> say<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:19.909> 65<00:00:20.659> to<00:00:20.689> 73<00:00:21.589> Mustang

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
regulator for say the 65 to 73 Mustang

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.950 
regulator for say the 65 to 73 Mustang
it<00:00:22.699> looks<00:00:22.999> fantastic

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
it looks fantastic

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.200 
it looks fantastic
I<00:00:23.989> mean<00:00:24.439> it's<00:00:24.859> got<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:25.249> correct<00:00:25.519> colors<00:00:25.939> on<00:00:26.179> it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
I mean it's got the correct colors on it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.429 
I mean it's got the correct colors on it
it<00:00:26.480> looks<00:00:26.720> brand-new

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
it looks brand-new

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.889 
it looks brand-new
but<00:00:27.769> the<00:00:27.919> guts<00:00:28.159> of<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.550> for<00:00:29.119> whatever<00:00:29.329> reason

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:29.899 
but the guts of it for whatever reason

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.419 
but the guts of it for whatever reason
just<00:00:29.929> doesn't<00:00:30.589> do<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:30.829> charger<00:00:31.220> system

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
just doesn't do the charger system

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.300 
just doesn't do the charger system
justice<00:00:32.059> it<00:00:32.509> either<00:00:32.689> over<00:00:33.170> charges<00:00:33.710> or<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.010> or

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
justice it either over charges or the or

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.640 
justice it either over charges or the or
the<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.850> charging<00:00:35.390> flutters<00:00:35.900> or<00:00:36.230> under

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
the the charging flutters or under

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.710 
the the charging flutters or under
charges<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:37.730> I've<00:00:37.880> come<00:00:38.120> up<00:00:38.210> with<00:00:38.240> a<00:00:38.420> great

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
charges so I've come up with a great

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.300 
charges so I've come up with a great
solution<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.350> something<00:00:39.740> like<00:00:39.800> that<00:00:39.860> for<00:00:40.250> a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
solution to something like that for a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.590 
solution to something like that for a
guy<00:00:40.490> that<00:00:40.520> wants<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.060> have<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.330> reliability

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
guy that wants to have the reliability

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.170 
guy that wants to have the reliability
of<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.290> newer<00:00:42.500> voltage<00:00:42.920> regulator<00:00:43.400> but<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
of a newer voltage regulator but the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.880 
of a newer voltage regulator but the
look<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.900> originality<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.710> old

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
look of and the originality of the old

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.150 
look of and the originality of the old
one<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:47.210> do<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:48.710> take<00:00:48.770> your

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
one this is what you do you take your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.100 
one this is what you do you take your
old<00:00:49.340> original<00:00:49.940> voltage<00:00:50.090> regulator<00:00:50.720> which<00:00:50.960> is

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
old original voltage regulator which is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.540 
old original voltage regulator which is
going<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.350> look<00:00:51.530> something<00:00:51.770> like<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:52.340> one

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
going to look something like this one

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.020 
going to look something like this one
here

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
here

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.420 
here
they<00:00:53.329> had<00:00:53.540> a<00:00:53.570> tall<00:00:53.990> cover<00:00:54.500> on<00:00:54.770> them<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.130> the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
they had a tall cover on them and the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.130 
they had a tall cover on them and the
reason<00:00:55.700> why<00:00:55.820> they<00:00:56.000> had<00:00:56.150> this<00:00:56.329> tall<00:00:56.570> cover<00:00:56.900> on

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
reason why they had this tall cover on

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.510 
reason why they had this tall cover on
them<00:00:57.320> was<00:00:57.710> because<00:00:58.040> they're<00:00:58.220> a<00:00:58.250> real

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
them was because they're a real

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.729 
them was because they're a real
mechanical<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> inside<00:00:59.900> to<00:01:00.140> accommodate

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
mechanical on the inside to accommodate

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.180 
mechanical on the inside to accommodate
that

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
that

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.190 
that
well<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.790> replacement<00:01:02.420> ones<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:02.989> get

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
well the replacement ones that you get

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.099 
well the replacement ones that you get
from<00:01:03.560> Napa<00:01:04.009> or<00:01:04.729> Lee<00:01:05.000> auto<00:01:05.179> parts<00:01:05.659> or<00:01:05.840> some<00:01:06.020> of

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:06.109 
from Napa or Lee auto parts or some of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:07.510 
from Napa or Lee auto parts or some of
the<00:01:06.170> places<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.560> are<00:01:06.770> out<00:01:06.859> there<00:01:06.890> near<00:01:07.310> you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
the places that are out there near you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.359 
the places that are out there near you
are<00:01:07.909> these<00:01:08.539> real<00:01:08.810> short<00:01:09.200> things<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.829> they're

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
are these real short things and they're

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.739 
are these real short things and they're
short<00:01:10.579> because<00:01:10.939> they're<00:01:11.119> transistorized

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749 
short because they're transistorized

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:14.109 
short because they're transistorized
they're<00:01:12.109> kind<00:01:12.289> of<00:01:12.380> solid-state<00:01:13.039> they've<00:01:13.850> kind

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
they're kind of solid-state they've kind

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.399 
they're kind of solid-state they've kind
of<00:01:14.210> come<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> long<00:01:14.630> way<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:14.990> far<00:01:15.200> as<00:01:15.289> their

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
of come a long way as far as their

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.879 
of come a long way as far as their
electronics<00:01:16.069> go<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.909> my<00:01:17.359> solution<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.229> to

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
electronics go so my solution is to

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.489 
electronics go so my solution is to
drill<00:01:19.340> out<00:01:19.579> or<00:01:19.939> unscrew<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.689> two<00:01:20.899> rivets<00:01:21.200> that

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
drill out or unscrew the two rivets that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:23.590 
drill out or unscrew the two rivets that
are<00:01:21.560> on<00:01:21.979> top<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:22.700> which<00:01:22.909> we've<00:01:23.119> done<00:01:23.389> with

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
are on top of here which we've done with

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.989 
are on top of here which we've done with
this<00:01:23.749> piece<00:01:23.990> here<00:01:24.439> what<00:01:25.280> you'll<00:01:25.460> do<00:01:25.609> is<00:01:25.789> I've

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
this piece here what you'll do is I've

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.179 
this piece here what you'll do is I've
sandblasted<00:01:26.899> this<00:01:27.079> and<00:01:27.319> I<00:01:27.439> painted<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:27.950> blue

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
sandblasted this and I painted it blue

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.760 
sandblasted this and I painted it blue
and<00:01:28.520> they<00:01:28.909> make<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.119> decal<00:01:29.959> that<00:01:29.990> goes<00:01:30.319> on<00:01:30.560> here

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
and they make a decal that goes on here

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.849 
and they make a decal that goes on here
to<00:01:30.889> give<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.280> originality<00:01:31.780> then<00:01:32.780> take<00:01:33.649> the

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
to give it to originality then take the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.590 
to give it to originality then take the
replacement<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.789> that<00:01:34.969> you've<00:01:35.090> gotten<00:01:35.420> from

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
replacement one that you've gotten from

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.649 
replacement one that you've gotten from
the<00:01:36.289> auto<00:01:36.439> parts<00:01:36.799> or<00:01:36.950> napa<00:01:37.340> drill<00:01:38.119> out<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.450> pop

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
the auto parts or napa drill out the pop

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.590 
the auto parts or napa drill out the pop
rivets<00:01:39.109> you'll<00:01:39.829> pop<00:01:40.100> open<00:01:40.369> its<00:01:40.850> cover<00:01:41.209> and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
rivets you'll pop open its cover and
