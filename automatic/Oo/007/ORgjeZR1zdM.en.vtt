00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
all right now I met

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.330 
all right now I met
really<00:00:15.020> has<00:00:15.170> five<00:00:15.560> items<00:00:15.830> that<00:00:16.130> are<00:00:16.219> worth

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
really has five items that are worth

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.820 
really has five items that are worth
mentioning<00:00:16.850> one<00:00:17.750> is<00:00:17.840> this<00:00:18.020> copy<00:00:18.320> paste

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
mentioning one is this copy paste

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.980 
mentioning one is this copy paste
metadata<00:00:19.369> now<00:00:19.700> we're<00:00:20.360> going<00:00:20.450> to<00:00:20.510> talk<00:00:20.690> about<00:00:20.869> a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
metadata now we're going to talk about a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.320 
metadata now we're going to talk about a
lot<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.320> different<00:00:21.680> ways<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:21.830> actually

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
lot of different ways to actually

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.670 
lot of different ways to actually
synchronize<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:23.360> add<00:00:23.720> metadata<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.410> change

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
synchronize and add metadata and change

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.730 
synchronize and add metadata and change
metadata<00:00:25.100> but<00:00:25.670> another<00:00:25.910> really<00:00:26.150> useful<00:00:26.740> way

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
metadata but another really useful way

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.589 
metadata but another really useful way
to<00:00:27.770> do<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.220> just<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.640> basically<00:00:28.970> copy<00:00:29.390> and

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
to do that is just to basically copy and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.150 
to do that is just to basically copy and
paste<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:29.930> just<00:00:30.080> like<00:00:30.200> you<00:00:30.349> would<00:00:30.500> any<00:00:30.770> file

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
paste it just like you would any file

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.950 
paste it just like you would any file
and<00:00:31.490> there's<00:00:32.000> also<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.239> shortcut<00:00:32.690> which<00:00:32.870> is

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
and there's also a shortcut which is

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.180 
and there's also a shortcut which is
kind<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.170> ridiculously<00:00:33.650> long<00:00:33.830> but<00:00:34.070> it's

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
kind of ridiculously long but it's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.729 
kind of ridiculously long but it's
control<00:00:34.550> shift<00:00:34.970> alt<00:00:35.239> +<00:00:35.720> C<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.290> then<00:00:36.379> ctrl

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
control shift alt + C and then ctrl

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.400 
control shift alt + C and then ctrl
shift<00:00:36.770> alt<00:00:37.309> +<00:00:37.640> V<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:38.989> we<00:00:39.110> can<00:00:39.230> take

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
shift alt + V and so we can take

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.930 
shift alt + V and so we can take
metadata<00:00:39.920> that's<00:00:40.129> applied<00:00:40.430> from<00:00:40.580> one<00:00:40.790> image

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
metadata that's applied from one image

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.210 
metadata that's applied from one image
and<00:00:41.239> just<00:00:41.420> easily<00:00:41.690> copy<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.290> next<00:00:42.470> now

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
and just easily copy it to the next now

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.830 
and just easily copy it to the next now
synchronizing<00:00:43.850> is<00:00:43.940> another<00:00:44.210> way<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.690> then

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
synchronizing is another way and then

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.660 
synchronizing is another way and then
you<00:00:44.960> also<00:00:45.110> have<00:00:45.230> Auto<00:00:45.620> synchronization<00:00:46.400> which

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you also have Auto synchronization which

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.549 
you also have Auto synchronization which
is<00:00:46.880> another<00:00:47.120> way<00:00:47.239> as<00:00:47.420> well<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.260> we'll<00:00:48.380> go<00:00:48.410> over

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
is another way as well and we'll go over

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.889 
is another way as well and we'll go over
all<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:48.890> when<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:49.280> get<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.610> metadata<00:00:50.210> but

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
all that when we get to metadata but

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.260 
all that when we get to metadata but
that<00:00:51.079> is<00:00:51.260> just<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.950> bring<00:00:52.430> that<00:00:52.579> up<00:00:52.700> those<00:00:53.059> are

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
that is just to bring that up those are

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.000 
that is just to bring that up those are
available<00:00:53.660> also<00:00:53.809> from<00:00:54.050> this<00:00:54.200> metadata<00:00:54.440> menu

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
available also from this metadata menu

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.700 
available also from this metadata menu
now<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.030> next<00:00:56.300> item<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.870> edit<00:00:57.260> capture

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
now the next item is this edit capture

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.799 
now the next item is this edit capture
time<00:00:57.890> now<00:00:58.219> if<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.520> ever<00:00:58.670> have<00:00:58.940> time<00:00:59.210> stamp

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
time now if you ever have time stamp

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.180 
time now if you ever have time stamp
issues<00:01:00.170> basically<00:01:00.559> if<00:01:00.620> you're<00:01:00.800> shooting<00:01:00.980> with

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
issues basically if you're shooting with

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.979 
issues basically if you're shooting with
multiple<00:01:01.550> cameras<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.180> they're<00:01:02.840> not

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
multiple cameras and they're not

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.990 
multiple cameras and they're not
correctly<00:01:03.500> synchronized<00:01:04.160> as<00:01:04.580> far<00:01:04.820> as<00:01:04.910> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
correctly synchronized as far as the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.940 
correctly synchronized as far as the
date<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.330> time<00:01:05.570> stamp<00:01:05.600> then<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.649> can<00:01:06.770> edit

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
date and time stamp then you can edit

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.279 
date and time stamp then you can edit
them<00:01:07.190> here<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.789> actually<00:01:07.880> correct<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.570> now

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
them here and actually correct that now

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.710 
them here and actually correct that now
we<00:01:09.350> have<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.680> specific<00:01:10.250> tutorial<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.450> so

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
we have a specific tutorial on that so

looking like em gai and we'll teach you
exactly<00:01:15.470> how<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.130> fix<00:01:16.789> timestamp<00:01:17.360> sync<00:01:17.600> issues

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
exactly how to fix timestamp sync issues

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.590 
exactly how to fix timestamp sync issues
but<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:19.069> found<00:01:19.910> right<00:01:20.030> here<00:01:20.209> in<00:01:20.420> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
but that is found right here in the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.290 
but that is found right here in the
metadata<00:01:20.840> menu<00:01:21.289> as<00:01:21.440> well<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.729> next<00:01:23.000> item<00:01:23.240> is

metadata menu as well the next item is
this<00:01:23.479> save<00:01:23.750> metadata<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.319> file<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.800> read

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
this save metadata to file and read

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.400 
this save metadata to file and read
metadata<00:01:25.490> from<00:01:25.700> file<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:27.020> save<00:01:27.259> is

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
metadata from file the the save is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.380 
metadata from file the the save is
actually<00:01:27.679> going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.860> save<00:01:28.100> those<00:01:28.250> 2<00:01:28.520> X<00:01:28.729> MPs<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
actually going to save those 2 X MPs the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.999 
actually going to save those 2 X MPs the
reed<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:29.840> actually<00:01:30.110> going<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.289> read<00:01:30.440> them<00:01:30.619> from

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
reed is actually going to read them from

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.040 
reed is actually going to read them from
the<00:01:31.130> XMP<00:01:31.610> s<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.179> if<00:01:32.300> there's<00:01:32.479> updates<00:01:32.869> or

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
the XMP s so if there's updates or

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.510 
the XMP s so if there's updates or
changes<00:01:33.080> you<00:01:33.530> can<00:01:33.649> actually<00:01:33.800> save<00:01:34.160> them<00:01:34.340> or

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
changes you can actually save them or

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.719 
changes you can actually save them or
read<00:01:34.759> them<00:01:34.910> from<00:01:35.090> those<00:01:35.300> XMP<00:01:35.840> files<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
read them from those XMP files and the

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.460 
read them from those XMP files and the
next<00:01:37.940> useful<00:01:38.209> item<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.599> this<00:01:38.720> purge<00:01:39.080> unused

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470
