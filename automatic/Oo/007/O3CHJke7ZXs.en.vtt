00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
what when it comes to this match I think

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.080 
what when it comes to this match I think
this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> most<00:00:50.460> unpredictable

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
this is actually the most unpredictable

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
this is actually the most unpredictable
match<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> show<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.770> could<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
match or the show because I could see it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.520 
match or the show because I could see it
going<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.820> many<00:00:53.969> ways<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.510> mean<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.260> see

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going so many ways I mean I can see

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
going so many ways I mean I can see
Layla<00:00:55.890> pick<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> win<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.820> could<00:00:56.969> also<00:00:57.090> see

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Layla pick up the win I could also see

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.889 
Layla pick up the win I could also see
summer<00:00:57.660> Rae<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> win<00:00:58.620> ah<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> most<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
summer Rae get the win ah but most of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.670 
summer Rae get the win ah but most of
all<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> maybe<00:01:01.890> being<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:02.969> contest

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
all I see it maybe being a no contest

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.630 
all I see it maybe being a no contest
because<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.949> far<00:01:05.750> Fandango<00:01:06.750> hasn't<00:01:07.229> really

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
because so far Fandango hasn't really

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.300 
because so far Fandango hasn't really
you<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.760> taken<00:01:09.299> aside<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:10.439> he's<00:01:10.650> told<00:01:11.010> Layla

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you know taken aside I'm he's told Layla

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.300 
you know taken aside I'm he's told Layla
that<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.060> he's<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.080> partner<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.010> her

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that you know he's the partner for her

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
that you know he's the partner for her
for<00:01:14.790> her<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.479> him<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.540> know<00:01:18.540> he<00:01:18.840> hasn't

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
for her for him but you know he hasn't

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
for her for him but you know he hasn't
like<00:01:20.009> bash<00:01:20.460> summer<00:01:20.909> Rae<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.479> anything<00:01:21.810> like

like bash summer Rae or anything like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.109 
like bash summer Rae or anything like

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that and the way Fandango has been

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.749 
that and the way Fandango has been
acting<00:01:24.479> lately<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.200> feel<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.280> been<00:01:26.400> acting

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
acting lately I feel it's been acting

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.350 
acting lately I feel it's been acting
more<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:28.619> face<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.729> somebody<00:01:30.210> who's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
more so as a face or somebody who's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.990 
more so as a face or somebody who's
about<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.960> turning<00:01:31.200> face<00:01:31.590> soon<00:01:32.000> then

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
about to be turning face soon then

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.950 
about to be turning face soon then
somebody<00:01:33.720> who's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> heel<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:36.450> aim<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.840> him

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.749 
for that the reason why I think it's
gonna<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> no<00:01:39.930> contest<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.700> a

label<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.819> going<00:03:30.209> into<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.200> looks<00:03:31.500> like

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
label so going into this it looks like

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.240 
label so going into this it looks like
summer<00:03:31.950> Rae<00:03:32.069> has<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.880> mental<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:34.350> we<00:03:35.069> could

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
summer Rae has the mental so we could

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.520 
summer Rae has the mental so we could
see<00:03:35.459> Layla<00:03:35.880> pick<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.329> win<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.440> she

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
see Layla pick up the win here so she

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.240 
see Layla pick up the win here so she
could<00:03:37.859> finally<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.489> rid<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.790> summer<00:03:39.269> Rae<00:03:39.540> and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
could finally get rid of summer Rae and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.030 
could finally get rid of summer Rae and
you<00:03:41.250> know<00:03:41.450> we<00:03:42.450> could<00:03:42.600> focus<00:03:42.870> or<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.709> focus

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
you know we could focus or the focus

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.890 
you know we could focus or the focus
would<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.340> Fandango<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.180> layla<00:03:45.780> and

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
would be on Fandango and layla and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.309 
would be on Fandango and layla and
they'll<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.440> summer<00:03:46.799> Rae<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.730> there<00:03:48.319> out

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
they'll have summer Rae out of there out

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.190 
they'll have summer Rae out of there out
of<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> way<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:49.859> guess<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.609> also<00:03:51.060> if<00:03:51.480> fan<00:03:51.840> tango

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
of the way I guess and also if fan tango

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.740 
of the way I guess and also if fan tango
doesn't<00:03:52.620> turn<00:03:52.859> face<00:03:53.489> anytime<00:03:54.090> soon<00:03:54.480> and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
doesn't turn face anytime soon and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.099 
doesn't turn face anytime soon and
remains<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.530> heel<00:03:55.859> then<00:03:56.849> I<00:03:57.389> think<00:03:57.900> there's<00:03:58.019> a

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
remains a heel then I think there's a

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.610 
remains a heel then I think there's a
possibility<00:03:58.349> there<00:03:59.099> a<00:03:59.599> Fandango<00:04:00.599> maybe<00:04:00.900> cos

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
possibility there a Fandango maybe cos

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.220 
possibility there a Fandango maybe cos
in<00:04:01.859> summary<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.430> match<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.780> could<00:04:03.989> you
