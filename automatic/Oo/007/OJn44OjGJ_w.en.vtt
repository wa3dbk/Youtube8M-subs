00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.419 

in<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.870> video<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.319> using<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.770> Raspberry<00:00:02.310> Pi

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
in this video I'm using a Raspberry Pi

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.869 
in this video I'm using a Raspberry Pi
B+<00:00:03.270> model<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.200> ordered<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:04.950> Kanaka<00:00:05.609> I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
B+ model so I ordered that Kanaka I

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.970 
B+ model so I ordered that Kanaka I
think<00:00:06.390> it's<00:00:06.480> called<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.810> ultimate<00:00:07.109> starter

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
think it's called the ultimate starter

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.060 
think it's called the ultimate starter
kit<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.550> think<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.179> bought<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.660> 73<00:00:10.530> bucks<00:00:10.830> but

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
kit I think I bought it for 73 bucks but

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.640 
kit I think I bought it for 73 bucks but
now<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.400> 69<00:00:11.849> bucks<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.049> video<00:00:13.440> will

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
now it's 69 bucks so this video will

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.939 
now it's 69 bucks so this video will
show<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.950> how<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> set<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.450> LED<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.350> get

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
show you how to set up the LED and get

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.920 
show you how to set up the LED and get
it<00:00:17.070> working<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.730> stuff<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.720> don't

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it working and stuff like that you don't

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.990 
it working and stuff like that you don't
need<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.650> know<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.070> breadboard<00:00:20.670> works

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
need to know how breadboard works

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.029 
need to know how breadboard works
anything<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:22.350> follow<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:23.010> lead

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
anything like that just follow my lead

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.970 
anything like that just follow my lead
and<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.390> should<00:00:24.600> be<00:00:24.779> able<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> figure<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> out

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and you should be able to figure it out

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.710 
and you should be able to figure it out
so<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> already<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.720> GPIO<00:00:28.650> -<00:00:28.880> I<00:00:29.880> believe

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so I already have the GPIO - I believe

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200 
so I already have the GPIO - I believe
it's<00:00:30.929> called<00:00:31.140> breadboard<00:00:31.800> interface<00:00:32.759> cable

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it's called breadboard interface cable

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.229 
it's called breadboard interface cable
already<00:00:33.450> plugged<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.370> it's<00:00:35.370> not<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
already plugged in it's not really that

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.280 
already plugged in it's not really that
hard<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.940> make<00:00:38.940> sure<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.329> matches<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:40.079> do

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
hard so just make sure it matches up do

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
hard so just make sure it matches up do
you<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.559> where<00:00:40.770> three<00:00:41.399> volt<00:00:41.640> plus<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.390> lines

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you see where three volt plus it lines

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.959 
you see where three volt plus it lines
up<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.200> red<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.129> -<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> lines<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
up with the red and then - it lines up

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
up with the red and then - it lines up
with<00:00:45.180> -<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.899> same<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> other<00:00:46.980> side

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
with - and same thing for the other side

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.080 
with - and same thing for the other side
and<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.140> connected<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> third<00:00:50.700> one

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and I have it connected to the third one

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.869 
and I have it connected to the third one
so<00:00:51.420> let's<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
so let's just you can see it's on the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520 
so let's just you can see it's on the
third<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.420> let's<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.750> another<00:00:55.020> camera<00:00:55.350> angle

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
third one let's get another camera angle

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.979 
third one let's get another camera angle
on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> third<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.449> pause<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
on the third one so you can pause the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.439 
on the third one so you can pause the
video<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.030> set<00:01:00.239> up

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
video and see how it's set up

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.990 
video and see how it's set up
it's<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.289> too<00:01:01.530> complicated<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.399> hope<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.850> guys

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's not too complicated I hope you guys

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
it's not too complicated I hope you guys
will<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.329> able<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> figure<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.320> did<00:01:04.739> not

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
will be able to figure it out I did not

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
will be able to figure it out I did not
want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> open<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.820> internals<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
want to open the internals get a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.170 
want to open the internals get a
resistor<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.619> looks<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
resistor that looks like this so I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.710 
resistor that looks like this so I
that's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.930> brown<00:01:10.610> blob<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that's a brown blob I think that's a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
that's a brown blob I think that's a
brown<00:01:12.960> black<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.920> orange<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
brown black and then orange this is a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.899 
brown black and then orange this is a
1000<00:01:15.390> ohm<00:01:15.509> resistor<00:01:16.250> don't<00:01:17.250> worry<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
1000 ohm resistor don't worry about it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
1000 ohm resistor don't worry about it
so<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> resistor<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> looks<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so just get a resistor that looks like

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.870 
so just get a resistor that looks like
this<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.580> plug<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> GPIO<00:01:22.170> 17<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this and then plug it to the GPIO 17 so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
this and then plug it to the GPIO 17 so
it<00:01:24.030> should<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.740> end

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it should go like this and the other end

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.940 
it should go like this and the other end
would<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:27.090> behind<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.020> okay<00:01:28.170> now

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
would go just right behind it okay now

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.789 
would go just right behind it okay now
it's<00:01:29.130> time<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.880> LED<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.689> picked<00:01:31.259> red<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it's time to get our LED I picked red I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
it's time to get our LED I picked red I
don't<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.340> why<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> picked<00:01:33.150> red<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
don't know why but I picked red so the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
don't know why but I picked red so the
bigger<00:01:34.560> side<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> positive<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> smaller

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
bigger side is positive and the smaller

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.560 
bigger side is positive and the smaller
side<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.810> negative<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.100> plug<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> bigger

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
side is negative so plug in the bigger

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.999 
side is negative so plug in the bigger
side<00:01:40.490> just<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.079> right<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.799> bigger

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
side just on the right there the bigger

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
side just on the right there the bigger
side<00:01:44.280> should<00:01:44.579> match<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> resistor

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
side should match up with the resistor

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
side should match up with the resistor
and<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.470> negative<00:01:46.920> should<00:01:47.220> match<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.700> with

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and the negative should match up with

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.260 
and the negative should match up with
ground<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.549> resistor

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
ground so here I have the resistor

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.859 
ground so here I have the resistor
lining<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.590> 17<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
lining up with 17 and then here is the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
lining up with 17 and then here is the
positive<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.860> here's<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.250> negative

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
positive and then here's the negative

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.480 
positive and then here's the negative
and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.990> plug<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.469> ribbon<00:01:58.950> cable<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and then plug in your ribbon cable and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
and then plug in your ribbon cable and
set<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.509> Raspberry<00:02:01.049> Pi<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.530> hope<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.100> know

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
set up your Raspberry Pi I hope you know

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.030 
set up your Raspberry Pi I hope you know
how<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> set<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.090> Raspberry<00:02:03.570> Pi<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:04.170> yeah

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
how to set up a Raspberry Pi it's yeah

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.039 
how to set up a Raspberry Pi it's yeah
if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.549> don't<00:02:05.790> maybe<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.420> should<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.780> even

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
if you don't maybe you should not even

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.130 
if you don't maybe you should not even
watch<00:02:07.229> tutorials<00:02:08.009> about<00:02:08.160> LEDs<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.360> stuff<00:02:09.629> so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
watch tutorials about LEDs and stuff so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.970 
watch tutorials about LEDs and stuff so
so<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:11.039> take<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> note<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:11.910> this

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
so just take a note on this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.020 
so just take a note on this
Oh<00:02:13.010> 17<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.360> have<00:02:14.540> number<00:02:14.900> 11<00:02:15.379> pin<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
Oh 17 is you have number 11 pin so the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.600 
Oh 17 is you have number 11 pin so the
code<00:02:17.239> will<00:02:17.269> make<00:02:17.690> sense<00:02:17.930> love<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.410> bit<00:02:18.650> more<00:02:18.920> so

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
code will make sense love a bit more so

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:37.020 
code will make sense love a bit more so
let's<00:02:19.819> go<00:02:20.060> ahead<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.420> go<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.780> computer

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.850 

now<00:02:38.030> log<00:02:38.300> into<00:02:38.630> your<00:02:38.810> Raspberry<00:02:39.290> Pi<00:02:39.380> I'm

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
now log into your Raspberry Pi I'm

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.309 
now log into your Raspberry Pi I'm
assuming<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.819> you're<00:02:41.120> running<00:02:41.330> recipient

this<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.920> noobs<00:02:55.400> who<00:02:55.790> don't<00:02:56.030> know<00:02:56.209> how

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
this is for the noobs who don't know how

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.500 
this is for the noobs who don't know how
to<00:02:56.420> use<00:02:56.690> terminal<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.319> stuff<00:02:57.980> like<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.510> now

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
to use terminal and stuff like that now

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.210

click on the file manager and that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.729 
click on the file manager and that
should<00:03:01.640> pop<00:03:01.819> up<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.120> window<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:02.750> then<00:03:03.349> in<00:03:03.470> here

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
should pop up a window and then in here

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.640 
should pop up a window and then in here
I<00:03:03.769> create<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.310> new<00:03:04.400> folder<00:03:05.000> called<00:03:05.049> for<00:03:06.049> video

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I create a new folder called for video

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.059 
I create a new folder called for video
to<00:03:06.860> make<00:03:07.069> things<00:03:07.370> organized<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.860> want<00:03:10.010> to

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
to make things organized if you want to

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.500 
to make things organized if you want to
follow<00:03:10.160> along<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.640> should<00:03:11.000> probably<00:03:11.239> also

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
follow along you should probably also

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.979 
follow along you should probably also
create<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.019> folder<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.680> folder<00:03:13.340> called<00:03:13.750> for<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
create a folder a folder called for a

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.309 
create a folder a folder called for a
video<00:03:15.470> if<00:03:15.709> for<00:03:16.069> our<00:03:16.250> V<00:03:16.549> IDE<00:03:16.940> or<00:03:17.329> without<00:03:18.019> any

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
video if for our V IDE or without any

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.870 
video if for our V IDE or without any
space<00:03:19.359> ok<00:03:20.359> now<00:03:20.569> inside<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.709> video<00:03:22.130> folder

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
space ok now inside the for video folder

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.300 
space ok now inside the for video folder
we're<00:03:23.359> going<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.569> create<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.930> new<00:03:24.319> blank<00:03:24.859> file

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
we're going to create a new blank file

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.879 
we're going to create a new blank file
so<00:03:26.269> when<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.630> click<00:03:26.840> on<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:27.380> will<00:03:27.680> pop

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
so when you click on this this will pop

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.599 
so when you click on this this will pop
up<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.280> call<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.090> let's<00:03:29.690> see<00:03:29.810> what<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.959> call<00:03:30.260> it

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
up and call it let's see what I call it

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.259 
up and call it let's see what I call it
LED<00:03:31.609> dot<00:03:32.150> P<00:03:32.660> Y<00:03:33.139> and<00:03:33.440> then<00:03:34.220> press<00:03:34.340> ok<00:03:34.850> make<00:03:35.120> sure

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
have dot py otherwise it's not going to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.250 
have dot py otherwise it's not going to
work<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:40.069> then<00:03:40.220> right<00:03:40.519> click<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:41.000> LED<00:03:41.930> dot

P Y and our double click it you should

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.000 
P Y and our double click it you should
have<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.239> text<00:03:47.690> document<00:03:48.170> thing<00:03:48.470> open<00:03:48.859> up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
have this text document thing open up

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.160 
have this text document thing open up
okay<00:03:49.639> so<00:03:49.700> here's<00:03:50.030> what<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.450> code<00:03:50.480> looks<00:03:50.780> like

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
okay so here's what the code looks like

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.559 
okay so here's what the code looks like
I<00:03:51.319> will<00:03:51.470> have<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.829> on<00:03:51.920> my<00:03:52.130> website<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.269> last

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
I will have it on my website so the last

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.170 
I will have it on my website so the last
line<00:03:53.930> where<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.260> says<00:03:54.290> GPIO<00:03:55.069> dot<00:03:55.400> output<00:03:55.970> and

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
line where it says GPIO dot output and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.319 
line where it says GPIO dot output and
then<00:03:56.720> parentheses<00:03:56.930> LED<00:03:57.680> comma<00:03:57.920> GPIO<00:03:58.670> dot<00:03:59.030> hi

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
then parentheses LED comma GPIO dot hi

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.039 
then parentheses LED comma GPIO dot hi
that<00:04:00.049> means<00:04:00.349> it's<00:04:00.680> on<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.880> have<00:04:02.030> GPIO<00:04:02.569> dot

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
that means it's on if you have GPIO dot

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.979 
that means it's on if you have GPIO dot
lo<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:04.130> means<00:04:04.370> it's<00:04:04.549> up<00:04:04.819> so<00:04:05.480> pretty<00:04:05.750> simple

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
lo that means it's up so pretty simple

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.199 
lo that means it's up so pretty simple
and<00:04:06.549> yeah<00:04:07.549> let's<00:04:07.819> do<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
and yeah let's do it

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.390 
and yeah let's do it
okay<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.959> run<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.530> application<00:04:10.190> you're<00:04:10.370> going

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
okay to run the application you're going

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.809 
okay to run the application you're going
to<00:04:10.579> need<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.849> open<00:04:11.060> up<00:04:11.389> LX<00:04:12.169> terminal<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.400> inside
