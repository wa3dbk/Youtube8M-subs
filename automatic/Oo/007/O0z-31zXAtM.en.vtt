gonna do you take your two pieces and
put<00:01:15.979> in<00:01:18.160> an<00:01:19.160> X<00:01:19.900> you're<00:01:20.900> gonna<00:01:21.050> fold<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.680> half

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
put in an X you're gonna fold it in half

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.140 
put in an X you're gonna fold it in half
like<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.310> triangle<00:01:22.820> put<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.870> on<00:01:24.020> top<00:01:25.150> your

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
like the triangle put it on top your

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.840 
like the triangle put it on top your
that<00:01:26.300> with<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.540> other<00:01:26.660> side<00:01:26.930> too<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.850> we'll

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
that with the other side too so we'll

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.440 
that with the other side too so we'll
make<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.150> second<00:01:29.510> trial

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.240 

and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> book<00:01:34.619> near<00:01:34.950> tape

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.980 

so<00:01:40.730> it's<00:01:40.880> going<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.090> look<00:01:41.180> like<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:41.780> far

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
so it's going to look like that so far

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.310 
so it's going to look like that so far
and<00:01:42.830> then<00:01:42.950> you're<00:01:43.100> gonna<00:01:43.220> flip<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.580> over<00:01:44.260> we<00:01:45.260> do

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
and then you're gonna flip it over we do

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.180 
and then you're gonna flip it over we do
the<00:01:45.440> same<00:01:45.620> thing<00:01:45.830> on<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.070> other<00:01:46.130> side<00:01:48.190> gonna

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
the same thing on the other side gonna

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:59.149 
the same thing on the other side gonna
do<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.580> triangles<00:01:50.330> like<00:01:50.480> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.190 

and<00:01:59.700> then<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.060> your<00:02:00.090> participate
