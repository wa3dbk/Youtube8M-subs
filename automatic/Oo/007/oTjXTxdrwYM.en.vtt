00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.099
 i make shu cells well let's talk like that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:17.240
 in a carpenter's way, usually shu cells 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.050
 I do try to use trim 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.740
 here are some 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.359
 remain in any carpentry shop 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.730
 In my case, these scraps should not be 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 less than 35 centimeters because between 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 shafts clamp on the lug mechanism on 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 surface gauge is just 35 centimeters so 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.730
 they are quite suitable for making 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.219
 small tuhlyak what is shu cell 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 laying this drawer in the open spaces 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.789
 the Internet where you saw the correspondence 2 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.809
 joiners who wrote one to another 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.940
 tukhlyak some moronic name 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.360
 the second put him yes indeed 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800
 moronic name well the words shu cell 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 came to us in the time of Peter 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.890
 first of german in german 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
 cheaper just means retractable 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 box and if someone doesn't like it 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.750
 title 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.680
 will call it drawers 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.659
 for making shuhlyady 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 you must first pick the material i 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.530
 already said to decide on the size 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.570
 shuhlyady 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.470
 and gain the amount of material 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.490
 necessary for the manufacture of nth 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.369
 the number of shuhlyada 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.409
 your review is cropped with torez then 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.079
 cut to size daddy hare 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.670
 the width is then aligned base 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.270
 Norris mass is skipped to the desired 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.740
 thickness 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.900
 in this case, here it is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.009
 the fixture we held 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 practically yourself 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.590
 it is designed tuned rather to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 17 millimeters thick 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.340
 although you can do anywhere from 15 to 25 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.009
 millimeters thick from the bed after 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 how did you prepare all the slats on that cell 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.790
 boards boards must be milled on 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.790
 frese 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.600
 bottom groove 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.280
 In this case for the bottoms I use 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.160
 plywood is 8 millimeters thick therefore 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.250
 the eight mill in a milling cutter of lanpas 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.360
 the cages are made for antiqued buffet 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.100
 so they will move not on 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.070
 tree trains for wood dosage 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.980
 dovetail groove is used such 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.270
 bevel cutter and special 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.950
 made attachment to it with 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.110
 guide ring and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.100
 textolite is glued here for better 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.570
 slip now look how is done 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.820
 first after turning the cutter on 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.070
 mural straight line in order to 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.630
 further you milling was not 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.630
 chipped and so watched 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.400
 but 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.790
 movements should be smooth and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.790
 uniform for that of course 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.910
 some practice is needed but I 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.150
 I think that if a person is constantly 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.110
 engaged in this business that for many 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.110
 operations are obtained 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.510
 after you milled all 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:10.609
 blanks need back 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.930
 which goes back for example cut here 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:21.320
 so on the circular saw 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:32.229
 and then you just put glue into the grooves 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:32.229
 you milled and glued parts 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.699
 it turns out so smooth 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:44.930
 cool exactly and so connection 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:47.060
 the way you glue and fully drawers and with 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.750
 styling you will have here 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.970
 approximately here is such a view 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.120
 notice the back is trimmed 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.280
 goes exactly in the groove 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.630
 thereafter measuring the bottom and cuts 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:08.690
 you grind and paste 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:11.630
 shu cage from behind you spin here 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.570
 screws or cloves and such 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:20.090
 way shu cell you get 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 finished in this case as i already 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.830
 talked shocked lapses are made for 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.060
 special buffet or showcase 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.970
 they say here in Transcarpathia 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.970
 kridens a and they 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.380
 to move the tree 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.340
 In this case, court lyashko 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.139
 match up perfectly with that hole 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.699
 which 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.699
 designed specifically for this shuhlyady 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:07.680
 so we are doing everything Schuch Lyapkov 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.499
 for furniture that we produce 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.069
 small carpentry shop 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.069
 Thanks for attention
