00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.789
 welcome friends who android pointit 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:21.810
 we are from a company of nexus 7 the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.029
 2013 updated via ote to android 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.460
 4.4 tic we are going to see which are the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 novelty what has changed with this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.810
 update to see first 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.059
 this arrow pointing upwards 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:41.460
 that which indicates the start of of 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.780
 google google now for accuracy 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.390
 from the lock screen enough 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.059
 carry out this swipe upwards and 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.460
 the google opens immediately 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.020
 but back to the lock screen 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.649
 because I want to show you too 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.890
 another thing 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.260
 as you can see the clock no longer has 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.410
 let's say the first two numbers those 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.070
 of the hour x to understand us as if they were in 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.539
 bold therefore more doubts and marked but 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.610
 they are all the same 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.310
 the lock screen remained the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.869
 same we don't have with the swipe 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.580
 from left to right as we have 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.479
 seen in the launch of kit kat which is typical 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.520
 del nexus 5 starting google now 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.819
 but we have the usual usual screen 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.429
 we don't even have stretcher status 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:31.119
 transparent nabar but are with remain 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:35.229
 still dark as well as the 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.619
 folder formation remained of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.950
 all the same as you see we still have 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.200
 the screen the black background we can 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.239
 note however the variation of de 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.759
 chromatic second with white color 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.789
 which predominates even if we then draw 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.360
 in the app drawer how we see blue gold is 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.160
 remained typical of the nexus as well as also 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.020
 widgets the widget page 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.700
 I have to say however what I noticed i 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.800
 clearly improvements definitely 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.489
 in the already excellent fluidity fluidity 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.110
 of nexus 7 though also if you go to 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.870
 see and review the review I have 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.200
 done right 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.780
 very little time ago I noticed that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.900
 there was some lag a certain delay 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.090
 in the typical widget page a 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.680
 po of the android operating system on 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.500
 all devices this thing that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.890
 instead it has improved a lot 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 I noticed an improvement also in the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.959
 pietro battery life before it was 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.900
 on it was about eight hours like 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.700
 what also stated by google 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.760
 same as you see now I am a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.950
 46 percent in charge of it and 10 hours e 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.640
 half of use with real racing come 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.650
 dite has in short used almost for 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.659
 an hour then improvement in the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.970
 battery even in the icons apart from the 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.560
 settings there is not a big one 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.310
 difference is that of the camera 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.239
 recurring the camera and the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.730
 settings there is not a big one 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.950
 difference compared to the icons of 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.409
 android 4.3.3 we have in the settings 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.739
 the possibility of going to print with 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.239
 cloud print directly with a 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.069
 wifi printer 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.209
 we have the home page section where 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.980
 we can choose the one with which 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.959
 application start ie which will launch 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.959
 use if we have more than one 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.959
 I'm using that stock of android 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.959
 4.4 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.290
 we have multi customization 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.209
 user as we also had in 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.650
 android 4.3 and now in accounts not 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.079
 we have more the display of the and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.900
 mail but as you see we have the type of 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.209
 email in this case pop3 or 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.680
 if there was one in diamo in the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.799
 tablet information as you see 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.400
 we have the android 4.4 version the hood 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:08.189
 which will then lead us to the opening of the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.079
 seregno android 4.4 what else we have 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:14.720
 still the opening of google not through 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.709
 the menu button as you see the fluency 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.750
 despite all open applications 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.280
 so really great you see 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.169
 very very good 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.610
 as you see in the application of a 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.880
 widget page we still have the clock 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.979
 the widget with the format I pd 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.990
 even if for reality like that vi 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.430
 I show this clock widget not 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.990
 we have more this time in 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.340
 previous format as in the format 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.490
 previous one 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.930
 what else to say I noticed and it happened 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.199
 only this morning when I turned it back on 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.599
 that there was a problem with the signal 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.479
 wifi gen this is just wifi version 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.620
 32 gigabytes only wifi and failed 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.110
 to hook up the signal 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.039
 I had to either restart then shut down e 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.840
 turn the device back on what it is 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.300
 happened only this morning then the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.580
 navigation is back in the link is 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.270
 returned to normal and therefore also the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.190
 navigation we open a new tab 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.510
 let's go to the site with the android 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.900
 point it 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.490
 as you can see it has practically opened 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:26.349
 instantly we have widgets 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:31.550
 new in the page short as you see 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.940
 fluidity is more than good 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.800
 to say 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.830
 for the rest there have been no since 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.479
 big changes is practically 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:44.720
 remained all the same only when you go 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:46.430
 for example to create a folder is the 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.530
 folder circle as you can 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.970
 see if you can see the one between 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.660
 folders that is now white instead 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.300
 first and blue ramiro I don't remember 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.800
 however that this minimum is 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.370
 minimal differences more than anything else that is 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.819
 was definitely an improvement since 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.720
 point of view of speed software 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.370
 and battery life 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.349
 I'll see in the next few days why 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.770
 mostly arrived just last night 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:18.740
 so I got to test it a lot 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.680
 little if the wifi problem exists or 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.639
 more or less already in the review of the nex 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.550
 7 2013 thousand euros talked about the problem 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:31.130
 of the hand on the device when 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:35.000
 above all we moved away from the dal 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.460
 wifi results in a heavy loss 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.630
 of the signal also this for example is 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.380
 something I haven't noticed since last night 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.270
 to date 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.000
 indeed I noticed that the signal improved 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.770
 for the problem of the coupling it may be 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.130
 that was no problem today 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.960
 however, if there is a detection 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.130
 in short, that there is this problem 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.759
 definitely good 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:05.330
 I'll talk another thing I did a 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:07.849
 test with hunt utoe gave me how 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:12.330
 go 4.3 now I don't remember if this 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:16.229
 was 20,370 6 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:21.659
 let's see if so much where it is 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:25.319
 here it is, we are waiting for it to start a little 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:29.069
 slower since the update here is 20.449 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:31.590
 then this and that with a test 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.659
 benchmark made with the new one 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:38.060
 android version 4.4 kit kat 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:40.949
 while 20,300 and broken was carried out with 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.270
 andrea of ​​4.3 then a light one 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:45.719
 there has actually been improvement 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:49.080
 also from the white ones from the benchmark test 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:50.599
 but I repeat I realized the text 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.530
 because I realized that 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:55.560
 indeed there had been a 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.840
 improvement in speed altogether 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.310
 the system with this is all if you have 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.599
 curiosity as usual I invite you to 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.349
 ask the questions on our page 

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:07.830
 answer la on forum and in all our 

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:11.360
 social on youtube too was a greeting a 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.360
 all the readers of the android point it
