00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
wasn't quite as bad and it's not like

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.659 
wasn't quite as bad and it's not like

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
radioactive or anything like that so you

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.060

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
can visit it and walk around very freely

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.980 
can visit it and walk around very freely
it's<00:05:08.669> actually<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.030> very<00:05:09.240> popular<00:05:09.450> tourist

it's actually a very popular tourist
spot<00:05:10.229> that's<00:05:10.410> why<00:05:10.560> it's<00:05:10.680> not<00:05:10.800> completely

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
spot that's why it's not completely

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.460 
spot that's why it's not completely
overgrown<00:05:11.700> if<00:05:12.389> you<00:05:12.479> remember<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:13.229> road

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470

but the fact is that roads probably
still<00:05:18.510> used<00:05:19.970> but<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.930> town<00:05:22.139> itself<00:05:22.639> really

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639
