separate video for some very specific
tests<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.489> did<00:00:35.610> define<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.090> using<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
tests and we did define this using the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.850 
tests and we did define this using the
macro<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> also<00:00:37.140> talk<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.350> potential

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
is a set amount of time this is the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.539 
is a set amount of time this is the
reason<00:02:50.410> why<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.590> maneuver<00:02:51.010> cannot<00:02:51.340> be<00:02:51.430> done

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
reason why this maneuver cannot be done

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.819 
reason why this maneuver cannot be done
effectively<00:02:51.730> or<00:02:52.150> easily<00:02:52.569> over<00:02:52.930> 50%<00:02:53.200> equipment

effectively or easily over 50% equipment
the<00:02:54.489> shortened<00:02:54.819> roll<00:02:55.000> length<00:02:55.180> means<00:02:55.450> that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the shortened roll length means that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.390 
the shortened roll length means that
even<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:56.109> frame<00:02:56.319> perfect'<00:02:56.680> inputs<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
even with frame perfect' inputs the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.039 
even with frame perfect' inputs the
player<00:02:57.640> cannot<00:02:57.879> have<00:02:58.120> roll<00:02:58.450> depressed<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:58.989> a

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
player cannot have roll depressed for a

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.330 
player cannot have roll depressed for a
great<00:02:59.230> enough<00:02:59.409> distance<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> roll<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.280> be

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
great enough distance of the roll to be

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.770 
great enough distance of the roll to be
considered<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.849> running<00:03:01.030> by<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.569> rolls

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
considered as running by the rolls

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.440 
considered as running by the rolls
completion<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.579> also<00:03:03.760> why<00:03:04.000> dinner<00:03:04.239> rolls
