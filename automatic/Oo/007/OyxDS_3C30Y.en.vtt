00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
any way and i'm probably infringing some

sort<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> copyright<00:01:48.869> agreement<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.640> let's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
sort of copyright agreement but let's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.609 
sort of copyright agreement but let's
just<00:01:51.450> keep<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> down<00:01:52.020> low<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just keep it on the down low for now I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.140 
just keep it on the down low for now I
am<00:01:52.950> help<00:01:53.310> selling<00:01:53.640> their<00:01:53.790> game<00:01:53.970> so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
am help selling their game so

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.110 
am help selling their game so
yeah<00:01:55.300> anyway<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.440> yet<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> sort<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.730> shotgun

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
yeah anyway and yet the sort of shotgun

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.300 
yeah anyway and yet the sort of shotgun
seems<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.630> be<00:01:58.750> pretty<00:01:59.350> much<00:01:59.590> identical<00:01:59.740> to<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
seems to be pretty much identical to the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.510 
seems to be pretty much identical to the
data<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:02.290> obviously<00:02:02.650> one<00:02:02.860> shot<00:02:03.070> kill<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
data it's obviously one shot kill of

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.820 
data it's obviously one shot kill of
cloves<00:02:04.110> especially<00:02:05.110> got<00:02:05.320> like<00:02:05.620> that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
cloves especially got like that

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.470 
cloves especially got like that
especially<00:02:06.460> if<00:02:06.760> you've<00:02:06.880> got<00:02:07.060> your<00:02:07.210> active

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
especially if you've got your active

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.160 
especially if you've got your active
reload<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.009> probably<00:02:09.340> one<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> hardest

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
reload it is probably one of the hardest

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.120 
reload it is probably one of the hardest
weapons<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.350> get<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> actual<00:02:11.710> real<00:02:11.980> it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
weapons to get the actual real it

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.800 
weapons to get the actual real it
because<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.520> length<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.300> time<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.570> takes

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
because of the length of time it takes

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.430 
because of the length of time it takes
to<00:02:13.960> reach<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.880> white<00:02:15.880> bit<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:17.200> tiny

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
to reach the white bit the little tiny

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.740 
to reach the white bit the little tiny
bit<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.910> you've<00:02:19.030> got<00:02:19.060> concentrate<00:02:19.690> on

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
bit and so you've got concentrate on

what<00:02:19.870> you're<00:02:19.960> doing<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.380> on<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.040> reload

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
what you're doing and on that to reload

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.310 
what you're doing and on that to reload

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.380 
although after a period of time you get
sort<00:02:23.530> used<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.400> saw<00:02:24.580> do<00:02:25.300> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
sort used to it and you just saw do it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.630 
sort used to it and you just saw do it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
guy is pretty nifty and he's probably

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.910 
guy is pretty nifty and he's probably
just<00:02:54.790> dodged<00:02:55.030> easier<00:02:55.360> somehow<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.930> then<00:02:56.650> um
