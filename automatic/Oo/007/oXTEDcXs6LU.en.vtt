00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.510 
moosa in the 87th minute and oddly
enough<00:05:21.599> my<00:05:21.630> opponent<00:05:22.259> decides<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.919> rage<00:05:23.190> quit

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
enough my opponent decides to rage quit

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.550 
enough my opponent decides to rage quit
in<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:23.759> 90th<00:05:24.120> minute<00:05:24.270> what<00:05:24.690> why<00:05:24.930> do<00:05:24.990> people<00:05:25.410> do

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
in the 90th minute what why do people do

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.680 
in the 90th minute what why do people do
that<00:05:25.590> but<00:05:26.250> in<00:05:26.370> order<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:26.699> give<00:05:26.880> Musa<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.330> chance

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
that but in order to give Musa a chance

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.050 
that but in order to give Musa a chance
I<00:05:27.810> decided<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.320> give<00:05:28.500> them<00:05:28.620> four<00:05:29.039> goals<00:05:29.340> for

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
I decided to give them four goals for

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.580 
I decided to give them four goals for
that<00:05:30.270> game<00:05:30.449> just<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.960> he'd<00:05:31.110> have<00:05:31.139> a<00:05:31.289> chance

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
that game just that he'd have a chance

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.770 
that game just that he'd have a chance
to<00:05:31.770> win<00:05:31.889> so<00:05:32.070> we<00:05:32.159> go<00:05:32.280> against<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.699> BPL<00:05:33.300> squad<00:05:33.599> that

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
to win so we go against a BPL squad that

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.170 
to win so we go against a BPL squad that
she's<00:05:33.900> very<00:05:34.139> solid<00:05:34.500> 4<00:05:34.680> 12<00:05:34.949> 12<00:05:35.250> team<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.729> in<00:05:36.090> the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
she's very solid 4 12 12 team and in the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.909 
she's very solid 4 12 12 team and in the
20th<00:05:36.539> minute<00:05:36.630> he<00:05:37.080> scores<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.560> basically

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
20th minute he scores and basically

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.070 
20th minute he scores and basically
nothing<00:05:38.550> happens<00:05:38.940> until<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.570> 90th<00:05:39.990> minute

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
nothing happens until the 90th minute

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.649 
nothing happens until the 90th minute
when<00:05:40.710> we<00:05:40.860> finally<00:05:41.310> get<00:05:41.669> through<00:05:42.000> with<00:05:42.180> moosa

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
when we finally get through with moosa

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.560 
when we finally get through with moosa
you<00:05:43.080> know<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:43.470> he'll<00:05:44.460> be<00:05:44.520> able<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.970> score<00:05:45.360> but

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
you know and he'll be able to score but

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.140 
you know and he'll be able to score but
obviously<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.590> is<00:05:46.710> not<00:05:46.740> enough<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.520> beat<00:05:47.760> eda

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
obviously that is not enough to beat eda

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.820 
obviously that is not enough to beat eda
and<00:05:48.449> Ed<00:05:48.630> it<00:05:48.780> ends<00:05:49.020> up<00:05:49.080> being<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.620> winner

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
and Ed it ends up being the winner

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.339 
and Ed it ends up being the winner
because<00:05:50.550> I<00:05:50.729> don't<00:05:51.240> know<00:05:51.300> 11<00:05:51.840> goals<00:05:52.020> in<00:05:52.169> three

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
because I don't know 11 goals in three

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.839 
because I don't know 11 goals in three
games<00:05:52.380> you're<00:05:52.860> not<00:05:53.070> gonna<00:05:53.220> be<00:05:53.370> able<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.669> beat

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
games you're not gonna be able to beat

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.060 
games you're not gonna be able to beat
that<00:05:54.060> like<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.539> is<00:05:54.659> just<00:05:54.690> insane<00:05:55.259> so<00:05:55.680> anyways

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
that like that is just insane so anyways

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.550
