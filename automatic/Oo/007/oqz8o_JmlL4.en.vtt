00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.600
 What people youtube or flickr came 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.220
 we even come in a new video this time 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.440
 we come to comment no combat little mont 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.130
 in this case it is an angel fight 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.110
 versus dyna that is a little more than a 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.079
 character a person who just climbed 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.880
 as of schubert as always very other 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.140
 Rat child this time in a girl 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.029
 rat ok 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.880
 we come to re-enter this fight 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.859
 that nobody can play simply if not 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.089
 know the verse that although we're going to 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.220
 comment on this combat in this case not 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:35.290
 it's me but it's my friend angel ok 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.900
 he takes out his leader and angel takes his to the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.530
 home 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.050
 ok he started the fight and pulled out sugar 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 primary that exists every time you see 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.490
 super great to me I really like this 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
 pokemon and much more in the show in 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.630
 primary 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 because this tree camera that is your 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.210
 skill that has 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.190
 you use citi as part of the house that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 is carried low angel which 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 enough life but yes that holds another 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.050
 site more than critical hits if not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.880
 they can not stand it ok to which they are street 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.800
 only one vote because they have very few 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.780
 defenses the house bencomo many of ya 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.330
 they know but it has a super attack 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.850
 special take out your ex lane with breaks 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 molds so you take away skill in 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.810
 this case skill is useless 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.440
 with we break from earthquake the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.289
 which weaken it weakens each ex 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.290
 Lane weakens neighbors' call and 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.350
 I remember that he called his name 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.970
 although it draws out kwassa kwassa without 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.580
 common youtube that looks brutally 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 beautiful this little mont is my little more 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.750
 favorite of my favorite pokemons 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 legendary and although many say that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.650
 more may be why that's my favorite 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.990
 but not from the beginning has always 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.540
 been pretty beautiful for me 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.370
 ok is this new king angry with 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.160
 which will resist enough 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.020
 well this ex fall and resist it with all 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.020
 five fish but he resists it so he gives 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.040
 per head iron which lowers 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.350
 a lot of life but it does not weaken 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.660
 definitely this rail house and another 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.190
 once for anger rayco ace so it kills 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.520
 definitely to xcaret 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.290
 dig and weakened and angel face glass to 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.290
 his next why would it be 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:25.120
 garzon is the next angel pokemon the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.939
 which is not faster and 100 mega 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.639
 evolved surrey thing with I do not know very 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.099
 little life they decide to evolve god 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:37.030
 I think it is for it to be faster 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:41.260
 I do not know if they are and not 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.739
 is confused so it hits is hit 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.489
 and you kill yourself and so root costs fall 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.489
 weakened 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.270
 Take out your next pokemon this wine and 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.000
 gaxiola for a dance for which it is 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.640
 pretty good in this case because it 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.960
 increases greatly the attack takes out its 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.580
 come on ok 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.070
 well grace fast enough and 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.960
 enough or not 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.760
 GarzÃ³n is faster than good and this is not 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.130
 I definitely expected it to be spent 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.710
 it was faster to come so we can 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.930
 see how this garzon ends with two little 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.640
 more than opposite team so good 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.440
 formula is pretty short but here 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.880
 remember well if you want me to comment 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.320
