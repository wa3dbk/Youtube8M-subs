00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.349
 san andrés azumiatla is located in the 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.530
 mexican state of puebla in the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.500
 municipality of puebla san andrés azumiatla 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.600
 provides a home to 8 thousand 509 inhabitants 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.330
 economic structure allows five 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.720
 homes have a computer seat 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.320
 15 a washing machine and 1,340 have a 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.990
 TV 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.270
 the peasants have land in 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.120
 those who sow beans bean than elite 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.220
 tomato zucchini however the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.800
 concern about the lack of rainfall is 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.680
 latent in assuming that the climate is very 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.129
 dry and according to its inhabitants every time 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.049
 it rains less 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.369
 and we peasants here when it rains 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:19.220
 we win and when we lose crap 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.220
 where are you going to return that money 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.410
 we all wait for the next one 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.800
 Year came the good year and I saw well 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.570
 when we get up and win we raise more 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.570
 close pumpkins 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.670
 coupled with this the forecasts of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.310
 Rainfall is not good 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.020
 for this year however there is a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.530
 technique to plant on their own 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.140
 houses 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.690
 hydroponics the cultivation without soil 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.180
 Hydroponics or hydroponic agriculture 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.450
 It is a method used to cultivate 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.700
 plants using mineral solutions in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.829
 instead of just agricultural 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960
 the roots receive a solution 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.850
 balanced nutrient dissolved in water 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.470
 with all the chemical nutrients 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.869
 essential for the development of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.180
 plants that can grow in a 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.120
 mineral solution only or in a 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.720
 half as inert as gravel washed sand 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.280
 pearlite among many others hydroponics 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.280
 helps to reduce the costs of 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.400
 production is not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.930
 depends on meteorological phenomena 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.480
 allows to produce crops outside the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.420
 station much smaller space is required 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.299
 and capital for more production 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.180
 incredible water savings as it is recycled 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.459
 saving fertilizers and insecticides 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.560
 no culture is used farm machinery 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.900
 free of parasites bacteria fungi and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 pollution allows to offer better 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.680
 prices in the market and you can 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.569
 cultivate in those places where the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.870
 normal agriculture is difficult or almost 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.870
 impossible 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.110
 and would take care of your projects for your 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.460
 consumption for the consumption of their families 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.410
 it's not like eating vegetables and that 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:12.430
 I would plant 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.430
 we are going to plant this tomato and tomato 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.550
 ponder this project will help the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.800
 construction of 5 homemade greenhouses 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.080
 hydroponics that will provide a 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.840
 more complete feeding and in turn 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.180
 encourage community work in 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.520
 base to the study that was carried out in san 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.560
 andrés azumiatla we realized that the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.110
 lack of economic resources 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.420
 inadequate knowledge and practices of 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.820
 storage of food oblige the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.440
 inhabitants to a diet based on 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.820
 simple carbohydrates sweet bread snacks 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.220
 characterized by its low cost and easy 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.950
 access resulting in problems of 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.350
 malnutrition and overweight problem that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.450
 grows rapidly in our country is for 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.670
 this that Paul's greenhouses and 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.580
 crops will provide the proportion 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.810
 needed vegetable vegetables to the 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.810
 families with hydroponics
