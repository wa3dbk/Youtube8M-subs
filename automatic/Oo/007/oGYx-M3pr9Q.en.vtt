today
it's<00:00:24.410> then<00:00:25.910> kind<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> stretch<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.269> fingers<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.070 
it's then kind of stretch your fingers a
little<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:28.980> bit<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.810> it's<00:00:30.810> pretty

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
little bit for first bit but it's pretty

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040 
little bit for first bit but it's pretty
simple<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.590> guess<00:00:32.030> first<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:33.840> top

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
simple I guess first you use your top

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.340 
simple I guess first you use your top
three<00:00:34.290> strings

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
three strings

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.840 
three strings
the<00:00:36.680> top<00:00:36.890> three<00:00:37.100> strings<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:42.920> bar<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
the top three strings and you bar the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.560 
the top three strings and you bar the
fourth<00:00:44.120> fret<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.600> all<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:45.050> them<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:47.210> then<00:00:47.420> what

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
fourth fret on all of them and then what

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.750 
fourth fret on all of them and then what
you<00:00:47.690> do<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:47.870> go<00:00:48.730> one<00:00:49.730> two<00:00:49.940> three<00:00:50.630> two

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
you do you go one two three two

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.910 
you do you go one two three two
and<00:00:53.210> then<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.450> take<00:00:55.000> your<00:00:56.000> middle<00:00:56.510> finger<00:00:56.920> put
