00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.070 

today<00:00:08.340> I'm<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.910> make<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.090> cake<00:00:09.480> but

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
today I'm about to make a cake but

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.020 
today I'm about to make a cake but
before<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:11.129> thought<00:00:11.490> I'd<00:00:11.610> stop<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
before I do I thought I'd stop and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.449 
before I do I thought I'd stop and
quickly<00:00:12.660> show<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.930> how<00:00:13.619> to<00:00:13.680> cream<00:00:14.100> butter<00:00:14.129> and

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
quickly show you how to cream butter and

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.640 
quickly show you how to cream butter and
sugar<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.000> there's<00:00:15.449> just<00:00:15.629> a<00:00:15.719> few<00:00:15.750> little<00:00:16.379> tips

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
sugar and there's just a few little tips

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010 
sugar and there's just a few little tips
that<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> need<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.460> know<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.600> able<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.900> do

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that you need to know to be able to do

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.710 
that you need to know to be able to do
that<00:00:19.199> really<00:00:19.529> well<00:00:19.700> so<00:00:20.700> the<00:00:20.850> first<00:00:21.120> thing<00:00:21.360> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
that really well so the first thing I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
that really well so the first thing I
think<00:00:21.780> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> most<00:00:22.380> important<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.280> get

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
think is the most important is to get

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.400 
think is the most important is to get
the<00:00:23.789> temperature<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> butter<00:00:24.900> correct

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the temperature of the butter correct

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.680 
the temperature of the butter correct
now<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> butter<00:00:26.850> is<00:00:27.030> a<00:00:27.060> little<00:00:27.360> bit<00:00:27.480> too

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
now if the butter is a little bit too

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.680 
now if the butter is a little bit too
soft<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.530> this<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.860> over<00:00:29.070> here<00:00:29.480> it'll<00:00:30.480> just

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
soft like this one over here it'll just

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.770 
soft like this one over here it'll just
collapse<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.099> bowl<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.940> won't<00:00:33.629> be

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
collapse in the bowl and you won't be

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
collapse in the bowl and you won't be
able<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> incorporate<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.920> air<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
able to incorporate much air into the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.750 
able to incorporate much air into the
mixture<00:00:35.789> if<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:37.350> too<00:00:37.620> hard<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.579> one

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
mixture if it's too hard like this one

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
mixture if it's too hard like this one
here<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.539> you<00:00:39.629> can't<00:00:39.929> spread<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.829> all

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here where you can't spread it at all

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
here where you can't spread it at all
it's<00:00:41.819> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.999> break<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.539> in<00:00:42.690> little<00:00:42.929> balls

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it's going to break up in little balls

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
it's going to break up in little balls
and<00:00:43.499> fly<00:00:43.859> all<00:00:44.190> over<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.519> kitchen<00:00:44.670> walls<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and fly all over your kitchen walls and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.599 
and fly all over your kitchen walls and
believe<00:00:45.749> me<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.170> experience<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.280> don't

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
believe me from experience you don't

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.689 
believe me from experience you don't
want<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.909> to<00:00:48.089> happen<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
want that to happen so this one here is

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.819 
want that to happen so this one here is
about<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.269> right<00:00:51.389> temperature<00:00:51.960> 20<00:00:52.469> degrees

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
about the right temperature 20 degrees

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.430 
about the right temperature 20 degrees
around<00:00:53.129> room<00:00:53.489> temperature<00:00:53.519> and<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> see

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
around room temperature and you can see

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.979 
around room temperature and you can see
that<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.799> quite<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.999> plasticine<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that it's quite like plasticine in

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.759 
that it's quite like plasticine in
texture<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.739> spreadable<00:00:59.420> but<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.319> too

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
texture it's spreadable but it's not too

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.369 
texture it's spreadable but it's not too
soft<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.909> since<00:01:03.209> this<00:01:03.359> one's<00:01:03.600> perfect<00:01:04.170> I'm

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
soft so since this one's perfect I'm

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
soft so since this one's perfect I'm
going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.620> quickly<00:01:04.830> give<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> cut<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.090> we'll

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
going to quickly give it a cut and we'll

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.120 
going to quickly give it a cut and we'll
pop<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:07.470> mix<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:09.350> small<00:01:10.350> cubes<00:01:10.770> are

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
pop it into our mix some small cubes are

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
pop it into our mix some small cubes are
the<00:01:11.729> best<00:01:11.969> for<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:16.759> i'm<00:01:17.759> using<00:01:17.850> 250<00:01:18.780> grams

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the best for this i'm using 250 grams

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.849 
the best for this i'm using 250 grams
today<00:01:21.079> and<00:01:22.079> we're<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.289> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> mix<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
today and we're just going to mix that

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:26.359 
today and we're just going to mix that
on<00:01:23.159> medium<00:01:23.579> speed<00:01:24.170> into<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> nice<00:01:25.439> pace<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.219> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
on medium speed into a nice pace so that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.279 
on medium speed into a nice pace so that
we<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.609> start<00:01:26.850> incorporating<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.659> sugar

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.959 

now<00:01:34.289> that<00:01:34.500> only<00:01:34.649> took<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.579> 30

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
now that only took really about 30

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.630 
now that only took really about 30
seconds<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.649> here<00:01:38.070> we'll<00:01:38.460> take

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
seconds and you can see here we'll take

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.660 
seconds and you can see here we'll take
it<00:01:38.789> all<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.920> worked<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it all out that that's worked really

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.969 
it all out that that's worked really
nicely<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.020> start<00:01:43.229> adding<00:01:43.439> our<00:01:43.679> sugar

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
nicely and we can start adding our sugar

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.850 
nicely and we can start adding our sugar
now<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.479> reason<00:01:45.719> you<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.259> add<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> butter

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
now the reason you don't add the butter

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
now the reason you don't add the butter
and<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.069> sugar<00:01:47.159> together<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:49.079> as

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and the sugar together is because as

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
and the sugar together is because as
soon<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.039> start<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.429> mixer<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:50.939> sugar

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
soon as you start that mixer the sugar

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
soon as you start that mixer the sugar
is<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> spray<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.780> over<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> room<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
is going to spray all over the room and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.719 
is going to spray all over the room and
you<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.039> don't<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you really don't want it to do that

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.149 
you really don't want it to do that
either<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.210> I've<00:01:55.170> got<00:01:55.439> some<00:01:55.619> castor<00:01:56.130> sugar

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
either so I've got some castor sugar

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.309 
either so I've got some castor sugar
that<00:01:56.520> i'm<00:01:56.610> using<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:56.969> today<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.170> use

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
that i'm using here today and we use

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.260 
that i'm using here today and we use
castor<00:01:58.770> sugar<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.549> finer<00:01:59.880> grain

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
castor sugar because it's a finer grain

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
castor sugar because it's a finer grain
and<00:02:00.569> we'll<00:02:00.719> incorporate<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.740> almost

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and we'll incorporate and almost

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
and we'll incorporate and almost
dissolve<00:02:02.610> into<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> mixture<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.990> bit

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
dissolve into the mixture a little bit

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.830 
dissolve into the mixture a little bit
quicker<00:02:04.289> so<00:02:04.979> there's<00:02:05.189> about<00:02:05.340> 250<00:02:06.030> grams<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
quicker so there's about 250 grams and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
quicker so there's about 250 grams and
then<00:02:07.799> again<00:02:08.099> we're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> beat<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.700> on

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
then again we're going to beat that on

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.759 
then again we're going to beat that on
medium<00:02:09.390> speed<00:02:09.599> until<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.880> see<00:02:12.329> it<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> nice<00:02:12.930> fine

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
medium speed until we see it a nice fine

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:26.020 
medium speed until we see it a nice fine
fluffy<00:02:14.640> white<00:02:14.849> mixture

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.970 

you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.209> see<00:02:27.569> now<00:02:27.840> I've<00:02:28.109> stopped<00:02:28.469> the<00:02:28.590> mixture

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
you can see now I've stopped the mixture

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.490 
you can see now I've stopped the mixture
but<00:02:29.159> it's<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:29.760> quite<00:02:29.969> right<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:31.170> still

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
but it's not quite right it's still

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.009 
but it's not quite right it's still
quite<00:02:31.799> yellow<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.640> bit<00:02:32.849> grainy<00:02:33.239> if<00:02:33.689> you

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
quite yellow and a bit grainy if you

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.569 
quite yellow and a bit grainy if you
take<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.409> little<00:02:34.620> bit<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.040> butter<00:02:35.250> mixture

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
take a little bit of that butter mixture

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.259 
take a little bit of that butter mixture
between<00:02:35.760> your<00:02:36.090> fingers<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.799> just<00:02:37.799> rub<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
between your fingers and just rub it you

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.479 
between your fingers and just rub it you
can<00:02:39.420> still<00:02:39.750> feel<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.170> lot<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.709> sugar<00:02:40.889> grains<00:02:41.250> in

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
can still feel a lot of sugar grains in

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.339 
can still feel a lot of sugar grains in
there<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.849> that's<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.329> quite<00:02:42.629> what<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:43.019> want

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
there and that's not quite what we want

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.229 
there and that's not quite what we want
we're<00:02:43.590> walking<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> texture<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.819> double

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
we're walking for the texture of double

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.420 
we're walking for the texture of double
cream<00:02:45.379> so<00:02:46.379> I'm<00:02:46.469> going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.709> give<00:02:46.889> that<00:02:46.920> probably

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
cream so I'm going to give that probably

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.550 
cream so I'm going to give that probably
another<00:02:47.730> five<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.329> seven<00:02:48.719> minutes<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.290> does

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
another five to seven minutes it does

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.530 
another five to seven minutes it does
take<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:49.950> long<00:02:50.189> and<00:02:50.549> do<00:02:50.879> spend<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.329> time

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
take that long and do spend the time

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:04.100 
take that long and do spend the time
because<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.409> definitely<00:02:52.620> worth<00:02:53.189> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.580

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
to be so tender you could just about

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.650 
to be so tender you could just about
enter<00:03:29.470> into<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.830> show<00:03:30.130> that's<00:03:30.880> taken<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.450> little

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
enter into a show that's taken a little

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.750 
enter into a show that's taken a little

bit longer than I expected it took about
10<00:03:34.180> minutes<00:03:34.390> but<00:03:35.080> that's<00:03:35.260> really<00:03:35.770> going<00:03:35.950> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
10 minutes but that's really going to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.310 
10 minutes but that's really going to
depend<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.180> environment<00:03:37.510> you're<00:03:37.930> working

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.070 
depend on the environment you're working
in<00:03:38.500> maybe<00:03:39.460> don't<00:03:39.700> go<00:03:39.880> on<00:03:40.000> time<00:03:40.300> think<00:03:40.870> about

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
in maybe don't go on time think about

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.770 
in maybe don't go on time think about
the<00:03:41.260> texture<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.430> sugar<00:03:42.910> should<00:03:43.210> be<00:03:43.300> nearly

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
the texture the sugar should be nearly

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.480 
the texture the sugar should be nearly
dissolved<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:44.740> rub<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.070> again<00:03:45.370> in

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
dissolved you can rub that again in

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.700 
dissolved you can rub that again in
between<00:03:45.790> your<00:03:45.910> fingers<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.350> feel<00:03:47.680> a

between your fingers and I can feel a

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.530 
between your fingers and I can feel a
little<00:03:48.040> bit<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.460> fine<00:03:48.730> grain<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.330> it

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
little bit of a fine grain there it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.450 
little bit of a fine grain there it
won't<00:03:49.840> completely<00:03:50.380> dissolve<00:03:50.890> but<00:03:51.280> it's

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
won't completely dissolve but it's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.840 
won't completely dissolve but it's
nearly<00:03:51.670> there<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:53.230> remember<00:03:53.740> my<00:03:54.100> few<00:03:54.550> couple
