I'm<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.420> sure<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.530> though<00:01:44.009> Clements

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I'm not sure and then though Clements

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
I'm not sure and then though Clements
wallet<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.360> three<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.899> half<00:01:46.110> inches<00:01:46.590> tall

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
wallet is three and a half inches tall

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
wallet is three and a half inches tall
and<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> 4/10<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.189> inch<00:01:50.540> taller

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and this one is 4/10 of an inch taller

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.770 
and this one is 4/10 of an inch taller
so<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.229> taller<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.799> way<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.369> thicker

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
so it's taller this way and it's thicker

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.209 
so it's taller this way and it's thicker
but<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.259> by<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.770> when<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.100> at

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
but it's not by a lot when you look at

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
but it's not by a lot when you look at
the<00:01:56.310> measurements<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> feels<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.270> lot

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the measurements but it feels like a lot

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
the measurements but it feels like a lot
when<00:01:57.719> you're<00:01:57.840> holding<00:01:58.049> them

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
when you're holding them

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.710 
when you're holding them
feels<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> bulky<00:01:59.670> wallet<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.420> feels

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
feels like a bulky wallet this feels

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.860 
feels like a bulky wallet this feels
just<00:02:00.990> more<00:02:01.890> compact<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.729> chic<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.300> my<00:02:03.450> opinion

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
just more compact and chic in my opinion

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.960 
just more compact and chic in my opinion
and<00:02:04.320> maybe<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.490> new<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970

and maybe it's because it's new and I
just<00:02:06.150> love<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.600> don't<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.170> I've

think it's a wonderful wallet also I

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.980 
think it's a wonderful wallet also I
just<00:05:46.650> like<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.490> little<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.330> feel<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:48.900> the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
just like the little the feel of the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.610 
just like the little the feel of the
compactness<00:05:49.590> of<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:50.400> Clements<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.440> love<00:05:52.440> the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
compactness of this Clements I love the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.529 
compactness of this Clements I love the
color<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:53.880> pops<00:05:54.840> with<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:56.510> monogram<00:05:57.510> and

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
color that pops with the monogram and

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.040 
color that pops with the monogram and
this<00:05:57.930> color<00:05:58.289> actually<00:05:58.830> pops<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.490> least

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
this color actually pops the least

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.779 
this color actually pops the least
because<00:06:01.050> it's<00:06:01.200> darker<00:06:01.710> but<00:06:02.039> I<00:06:02.070> still<00:06:02.370> love<00:06:02.610> it

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
because it's darker but I still love it

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.390 
because it's darker but I still love it
I<00:06:03.030> love<00:06:03.900> that<00:06:04.229> they<00:06:04.500> call<00:06:04.740> it<00:06:04.890> fuchsia

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
I love that they call it fuchsia

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.920 
I love that they call it fuchsia
supposed<00:06:05.880> to<00:06:05.940> be<00:06:06.000> a<00:06:06.030> dark<00:06:06.330> pink<00:06:06.630> but<00:06:06.840> it

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
supposed to be a dark pink but it

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.409 
supposed to be a dark pink but it
reminds<00:06:07.260> me<00:06:07.320> of<00:06:07.410> almost<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.830> light<00:06:08.039> burgundy<00:06:08.640> it

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
reminds me of almost a light burgundy it

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.390 
reminds me of almost a light burgundy it
just<00:06:09.780> seems<00:06:10.110> like<00:06:10.200> a<00:06:10.410> neutral<00:06:10.860> I<00:06:10.979> love<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.310> on

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
just seems like a neutral I love it on

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.050 
just seems like a neutral I love it on
the<00:06:11.430> sides<00:06:11.820> as<00:06:12.090> well<00:06:12.300> when<00:06:12.539> you<00:06:12.599> open<00:06:12.900> it

the mimosa it's a beautiful beautiful

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.300 
the mimosa it's a beautiful beautiful
yellow<00:07:04.150> and<00:07:04.450> I<00:07:05.110> think<00:07:05.350> that<00:07:05.500> has<00:07:05.680> a<00:07:05.710> nice<00:07:06.010> pop

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
yellow and I think that has a nice pop

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.280 
yellow and I think that has a nice pop
and<00:07:06.610> that<00:07:06.790> would<00:07:07.000> also<00:07:07.150> look<00:07:07.450> nice<00:07:07.990> in<00:07:08.260> my

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
and that would also look nice in my

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.920 
and that would also look nice in my
opinion<00:07:08.380> with<00:07:08.919> a<00:07:08.950> dummy<00:07:09.220> being<00:07:09.639> with<00:07:09.970> the<00:07:10.240> red

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
opinion with a dummy being with the red

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.159 
opinion with a dummy being with the red
interior<00:07:11.910> so<00:07:12.910> see<00:07:13.120> you<00:07:13.240> have<00:07:13.419> this<00:07:13.660> and<00:07:13.960> I<00:07:14.020> was

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
concerned when I got this wallet with

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.600 
concerned when I got this wallet with
this<00:07:16.120> fuchsia<00:07:16.419> kind<00:07:16.870> of<00:07:16.960> clash<00:07:17.289> but<00:07:18.250> it
