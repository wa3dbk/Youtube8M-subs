00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.600 

all<00:02:28.600> right<00:02:28.750> step<00:02:29.020> number<00:02:29.170> three<00:02:29.500> jumps<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
all right step number three jumps the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.190 
all right step number three jumps the
reason<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.970> table<00:02:31.270> talks<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.630> small<00:02:31.930> is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
reason the table talks so small is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.540 
reason the table talks so small is
through<00:02:32.380> here<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.560> made<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:32.830> bigger<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
through here I made it bigger and the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.640 
through here I made it bigger and the
reason<00:02:33.790> we're<00:02:33.910> using<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.300> tabletop<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:35.440> guy

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
reason we're using a tabletop this guy

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.130 
reason we're using a tabletop this guy
is<00:02:36.310> too<00:02:36.580> afraid<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.970> go<00:02:37.090> over<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.300> double<00:02:37.960> on<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
is too afraid to go over the double on a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
is too afraid to go over the double on a
125<00:02:39.240> it's<00:02:40.240> kind<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.540> hard<00:02:40.930> land<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.380> 125<00:02:41.950> was

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
125 it's kind of hard land for 125 was

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.310 
125 it's kind of hard land for 125 was
there<00:02:43.830> perfect<00:02:44.830> for<00:02:44.950> 250<00:02:45.430> okay<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:47.230> right
