you're<00:00:28.009> going<00:00:28.099> to<00:00:28.160> do<00:00:28.369> is<00:00:30.099> you're<00:00:31.099> going<00:00:31.189> to

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.330 
you're going to do is you're going to
make<00:00:31.310> like<00:00:31.580> an<00:00:31.700> arch<00:00:31.970> -<00:00:32.689> so<00:00:33.560> kind<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.010> it

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
make like an arch - so kind of like it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.670 
make like an arch - so kind of like it
so<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.850> looks<00:00:35.030> like<00:00:35.090> you're<00:00:35.329> looking<00:00:35.630> at<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
so it looks like you're looking at the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.900 
so it looks like you're looking at the
helmet<00:00:37.670> from<00:00:37.790> an<00:00:37.970> angle<00:00:39.250> sort<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.489> like<00:00:40.730> that

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
helmet from an angle sort of like that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.250 
helmet from an angle sort of like that
but<00:00:41.239> you're<00:00:41.360> going<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.540> make<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.780> thicker<00:00:42.050> so

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
but you're going to make it thicker so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.440 
but you're going to make it thicker so
you're<00:00:42.380> going<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.530> have<00:00:42.650> to<00:00:42.770> go<00:00:42.920> through<00:00:46.450> again

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
you're going to have to go through again

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.980 
you're going to have to go through again
and<00:00:48.820> maybe<00:00:49.820> again<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:50.330> depends<00:00:50.840> on<00:00:50.930> how

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
and maybe again it just depends on how

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.450 
and maybe again it just depends on how
how<00:00:51.470> thick<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.860> want<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:54.130> I'll<00:00:55.130> probably

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
how thick you want it but I'll probably

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.820 
how thick you want it but I'll probably
stay<00:00:57.220> probably<00:00:58.220> built<00:00:58.400> like<00:00:58.610> this<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.830> then

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
stay probably built like this and then

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.350 
stay probably built like this and then
I'm<00:01:01.040> going<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.190> take<00:01:01.310> my<00:01:02.270> white<00:01:03.159> move<00:01:04.159> my<00:01:05.059> green
