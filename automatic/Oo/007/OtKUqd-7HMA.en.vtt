hack<00:01:26.580> states<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.630> how<00:01:28.259> does<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
hack states that just because how does a

Ledge<00:01:28.710> campaign<00:01:29.189> yeah<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> think

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Ledge campaign yeah and then I think

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
Ledge campaign yeah and then I think
Johnny<00:01:32.040> said<00:01:32.340> he<00:01:32.430> thinks<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.030> easy

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
Johnny said he thinks it's really easy

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.870 
Johnny said he thinks it's really easy
yeah<00:01:33.990> Johnny<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.100> remember<00:01:35.430> Johnny<00:01:35.670> made<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
yeah Johnny I remember Johnny made a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.850 
yeah Johnny I remember Johnny made a
post<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> long<00:01:37.079> time<00:01:37.290> ago<00:01:37.439> actually<00:01:37.619> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
post or a long time ago actually was

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.480 
post or a long time ago actually was
just<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.909> throw<00:01:39.210> puff<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.950> air<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
just up throw puff and just up air the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.440 
just up throw puff and just up air the
heck<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> her<00:01:42.210> while<00:01:42.390> she's<00:01:42.689> above<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.399> um

heck out of her while she's above you um
and<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.170> honestly<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.710> solid

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and I think that it's honestly a solid

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.730 
and I think that it's honestly a solid
plan<00:01:47.340> yeah<00:01:48.270> pretty<00:01:48.960> solid<00:01:49.229> against<00:01:49.409> floaties

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
plan yeah pretty solid against floaties

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.609 
plan yeah pretty solid against floaties

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
in general well the grabbing puff can be

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.499 
in general well the grabbing puff can be
really<00:01:52.829> awkward<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.460> cannot<00:01:53.970> share<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.390> in

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
kind of weird in areas where I'll just

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.569 
kind of weird in areas where I'll just
tell<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.810> fool<00:02:01.290> jump<00:02:01.619> new<00:02:02.130> trailer<00:02:02.430> than

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
tell this fool jump new trailer than

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.679 
tell this fool jump new trailer than
just<00:02:02.729> sort<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> drift<00:02:03.149> around<00:02:03.270> kind<00:02:03.630> of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
just sort of drift around kind of

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
just sort of drift around kind of
randomly<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.130> awkward<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
randomly and it can be awkward to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.210 
randomly and it can be awkward to
predict<00:02:05.850> how<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> punish<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> end<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
predict how to punish that at the end I

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.290 
predict how to punish that at the end I
think<00:02:08.220> it'd<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.729> there<00:02:09.090> he

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
think it'd be just up here there he

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110 
think it'd be just up here there he
would<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.450> killed<00:02:09.539> or<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.229> least<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.649> kid

doing it that well honestly just feels

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.340 
doing it that well honestly just feels
like<00:03:08.420> why<00:03:08.600> she<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.810> wants<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.080> run<00:03:09.200> around

and do stuff like nothing in particular

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.720 
and do stuff like nothing in particular
just<00:03:14.180> okay<00:03:14.720> uh<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.560> he<00:03:15.680> keeps<00:03:15.860> he<00:03:16.460> keeps

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
just okay uh and he keeps he keeps

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.550

getting<00:03:16.970> down<00:03:17.120> throat<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.330> week<00:03:17.570> me<00:03:17.840> yeah<00:03:18.260> I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
getting down throat a week me yeah I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.710 
getting down throat a week me yeah I
think<00:03:18.890> if<00:03:18.980> he<00:03:19.040> stomped<00:03:19.460> there<00:03:19.670> well<00:03:20.630> he

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
think if he stomped there well he

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.060 
think if he stomped there well he
probably<00:03:20.960> would<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.290> need<00:03:21.590> your<00:03:21.710> cancelled

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
probably would have need your cancelled

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.860 
probably would have need your cancelled
it<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:22.370> he<00:03:23.000> would<00:03:23.120> have<00:03:23.240> gotten<00:03:23.360> back<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.690> Sage

generally do not like giving Falcon this
much<00:04:52.990> space<00:04:53.230> if<00:04:53.470> I'm<00:04:53.590> playing<00:04:53.740> a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
much space if I'm playing a

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.040 
much space if I'm playing a
significantly<00:04:54.490> slow<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.850> character<00:04:55.270> yeah<00:04:55.660> you

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
significantly slow in character yeah you

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
here like Falco but how if I don't think

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.710 
here like Falco but how if I don't think
is<00:05:00.940> one<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.120> them<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.610> feel<00:05:03.970> like<00:05:04.000> tough

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
is one of them and I feel like tough

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.980 
is one of them and I feel like tough
solid<00:05:05.200> punishments<00:05:05.770> on<00:05:05.890> filk<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.340> I<00:05:06.990> would

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
solid punishments on filk and I would

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.260 
solid punishments on filk and I would
wager<00:05:08.200> that<00:05:08.520> not<00:05:09.520> very<00:05:09.550> much<00:05:09.910> but<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.090> would

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
wager that not very much but I would

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.820 
wager that not very much but I would
wager<00:05:10.510> that<00:05:10.690> they<00:05:11.020> don't<00:05:11.200> depend<00:05:11.380> too<00:05:11.560> much<00:05:11.590> on

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
wager that they don't depend too much on

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.020 
wager that they don't depend too much on
platforms<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:13.020> can<00:05:14.020> feel<00:05:14.110> like<00:05:14.290> possibility<00:05:14.830> to

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
platforms I can feel like possibility to

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.890 
platforms I can feel like possibility to
punish<00:05:16.030> Falcon<00:05:16.330> here<00:05:16.480> would<00:05:16.600> be<00:05:16.630> fairly

punish Falcon here would be fairly

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.230 
punish Falcon here would be fairly
similar<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.500> on<00:05:17.650> say<00:05:17.860> battlefield<00:05:18.550> yeah

coming down and down airburst Falcon

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.060 
coming down and down airburst Falcon
doesn't<00:05:38.240> seem<00:05:38.360> like<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.600> best<00:05:38.720> of<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.070> just

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
it feels like I'll bear would definitely

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.510 
it feels like I'll bear would definitely
like<00:05:41.720> a<00:05:41.870> priority<00:05:42.230> no<00:05:42.950> matter<00:05:43.130> what<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.430> angle

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
like a priority no matter what the angle

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.980 
like a priority no matter what the angle
sometimes<00:05:44.180> it<00:05:44.360> just<00:05:44.480> isn't<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.780> much<00:05:44.870> you

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
sometimes it just isn't that much you

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.620 
sometimes it just isn't that much you
can<00:05:45.140> do<00:05:45.290> like<00:05:45.710> if<00:05:45.830> you're<00:05:45.950> a<00:05:45.980> super<00:05:46.310> floaty<00:05:46.630> you

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
can do like if you're a super floaty you

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.960 
can do like if you're a super floaty you
don't<00:05:47.810> fall<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.200> fast<00:05:48.410> you're<00:05:49.190> anuja<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:49.730> it

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
don't fall that fast you're anuja is it

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.520 
don't fall that fast you're anuja is it
safe<00:05:50.180> to<00:05:50.300> go<00:05:50.390> back<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.690> just<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.020> ledge<00:05:51.290> right

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
safe to go back to just the ledge right

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.650 
safe to go back to just the ledge right
like<00:05:51.830> right<00:05:52.040> now<00:05:52.070> instead<00:05:52.490> of<00:05:52.550> that's<00:05:53.450> really

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
like right now instead of that's really

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.480 
like right now instead of that's really
the<00:05:53.750> safest<00:05:53.960> thing<00:05:54.320> but<00:05:54.890> I<00:05:54.920> safe<00:05:55.130> getting<00:05:55.370> off

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
the safest thing but I safe getting off

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.010 
the safest thing but I safe getting off
the<00:05:55.610> light<00:05:55.760> yeah<00:05:55.970> I<00:05:56.000> guess<00:05:56.180> is<00:05:56.300> hard<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:56.840> also

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
the light yeah I guess is hard and also

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.510 
the light yeah I guess is hard and also
Falcon<00:05:57.470> can<00:05:57.620> still<00:05:57.830> afford<00:05:58.070> to<00:05:58.220> jump<00:05:58.400> out

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
Falcon can still afford to jump out

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.340 
Falcon can still afford to jump out
pretty<00:05:58.760> far<00:05:59.000> relatively<00:05:59.510> safely<00:05:59.840> so<00:06:00.110> like<00:06:00.230> if

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
pretty far relatively safely so like if

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.660 
pretty far relatively safely so like if
he<00:06:00.440> sees<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.740> drifting<00:06:01.130> there<00:06:01.280> or<00:06:01.430> thinks

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
he sees you drifting there or thinks
