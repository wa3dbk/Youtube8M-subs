00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.179 
told me about the cultural significance
of<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.240> project<00:02:02.859> well<00:02:03.859> Mase<00:02:04.609> is<00:02:05.090> probably<00:02:06.189> the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
of the project well Mase is probably the

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.740 
of the project well Mase is probably the
most<00:02:07.429> important<00:02:08.330> crop<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.929> Mexico<00:02:09.530> if<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.940> go

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
most important crop in Mexico if you go

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.040 
most important crop in Mexico if you go
back<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> Indian<00:02:12.800> culture<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
back to the Indian culture the the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.360 
back to the Indian culture the the
Madge's<00:02:15.560> build

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
Madge's build

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.039 
Madge's build
that<00:02:16.670> men<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.930> made<00:02:18.230> out<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.500> mace<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:20.049> since

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
that men was made out of mace and since

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.729 
that men was made out of mace and since
then<00:02:21.290> mace<00:02:22.220> has<00:02:22.549> taken<00:02:23.510> an<00:02:23.659> integral<00:02:24.260> part<00:02:24.560> of

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
then mace has taken an integral part of

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.479 
then mace has taken an integral part of
the<00:02:24.860> development<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.610> Mexico<00:02:26.260> culturally<00:02:27.489> in

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
the development of Mexico culturally in

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.710 
the development of Mexico culturally in
terms<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.970> religion<00:02:29.920> economically<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.310> also

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
terms of religion economically and also

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.069 
terms of religion economically and also
is<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:33.019> major<00:02:33.319> component<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.159> Mexican<00:02:34.730> diet

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
is a major component of the Mexican diet

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.119 
is a major component of the Mexican diet
so<00:02:36.079> we<00:02:36.110> considered<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.459> was<00:02:37.930> an<00:02:39.129> absolute

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
so we considered that it was an absolute

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.880 
so we considered that it was an absolute
requirement<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:41.209> Mexico<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.870> participate<00:02:42.620> in

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
requirement of Mexico to participate in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.789 
requirement of Mexico to participate in
the<00:02:43.310> sequences<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.420> Moschino<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.200> that

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
the sequences of the Moschino and that

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.819 
the sequences of the Moschino and that
we<00:02:45.950> could<00:02:46.190> select<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:47.060> maize<00:02:47.659> genotype<00:02:48.260> that

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
we could select a maize genotype that

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.330 
we could select a maize genotype that
was<00:02:49.209> ancient<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.290> could<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.650> used<00:02:51.920> also<00:02:52.129> to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340

there<00:03:14.000> were<00:03:14.180> offerings<00:03:14.659> burial<00:03:15.170> offerings

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
there were offerings burial offerings

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.409 
there were offerings burial offerings
where<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.879> could<00:03:17.120> find<00:03:18.340> cups<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.640> palomero

that had their seeds still attached and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.370 
that had their seeds still attached and
popped<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.280> it's<00:03:25.459> very<00:03:25.819> interesting<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.380> it's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
popped so it's very interesting and it's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.159 
popped so it's very interesting and it's
only<00:03:27.709> one<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.609> four<00:03:28.940> land<00:03:29.329> races<00:03:29.599> that<00:03:29.930> have

been found in archaeological remainings

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.500

so<00:03:33.709> therefore<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:34.549> believed<00:03:34.879> to<00:03:35.030> be<00:03:35.150> one<00:03:35.359> of

so therefore it's believed to be one of

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.110 
so therefore it's believed to be one of
