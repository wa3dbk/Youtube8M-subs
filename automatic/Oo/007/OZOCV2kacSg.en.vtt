00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello with you Elena and good 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.649
 recipes 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.490
 today I want to show you my recipe 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.110
 favorite dumplings with potatoes and spruce 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.110
 Marinochka very simple and very tasty 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 pan bring the water to a boil and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.199
 throw there peeled 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
 potatoes 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.160
 Boil the potatoes until tender me 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.020
 small potatoes so cooked quickly 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.470
 I think fifteen minutes will be 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 ready if you have big potatoes she 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.320
 will be boiled longer salt not water 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.710
 need the readiness of potatoes check 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.690
 fork on my potatoes ready now 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.270
 we pour water from the potatoes into another 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.239
 the pot does not need to pour water on us 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.489
 still need to test and give 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.110
 finely chop the potatoes a little 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.110
 Dill and parsley 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:19.320
 mash potatoes now add to 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.020
 mashed potatoes salt and pepper to taste 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 as well as our chopped greens 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.369
 mix it all and all stuffing 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.310
 ready to flour add salt here at 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.470
 I am 700 grams of flour and this amount 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.329
 flour I take a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.090
 now we add water from under 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.909
 potatoes water should not be cooled 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.210
 should be warm better hot right away 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.350
 all the water does not fly better because the flour 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 happens different 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.240
 she needs a different amount of water to us 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 you need to make a cool dough 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.909
 add water here i will add first 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.740
 somewhere around 250 grams and mix as a result 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.549
 dough for dumplings should work 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 tight and cool it should not stick to 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:16.350
 hands but it should 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.800
 well enough to roll that is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.090
 do not fill the dough with flour 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.040
 in the test need to be adjusted because 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.650
 the flour is different and it absorbs 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.690
 different amount of water because of this 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.530
 the amount of water will be a little each time 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.350
 be different after kneading give dough 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.580
 lie down a little and continue again 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:51.470
 knead like this 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.150
 roll it on the table 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.990
 explain what is the meaning of giving 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.020
 dough to lie down at the time when the dough 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:08.250
 resting in it gluten or gluten like 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.170
 once swell well and after that dough 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 easier to knead it becomes more 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.380
 uniform and elastic thanks here 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.840
 this swollen gluten 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:28.230
 powder the table with flour and roll out 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:31.170
 our dough is very thin layer can be here 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.220
 so stretch the dough given enough 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.340
 will stretch 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.030
 will again roll out the dough well, that I 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.540
 rolled thin enough now you can 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.220
 cut circles for dumplings 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.380
 for cutting circles i'm using here 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.190
 such a metal form but will fit 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.190
 ordinary glass 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.150
 excess dough then remove them 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.980
 roll yet 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.640
 layer and cut more circles now on 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.590
 put the stuffing in the middle of the dough circles 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.190
 I spent another hour stretching this one 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.310
 circle 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:23.320
 because he has already managed to cope 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:29.380
 put in the middle of the circle stuffing from 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.169
 Potatoes with greens and stifle the edges 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.620
 So 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:40.419
 closing up and now you can form 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.180
 here the pattern can be using forks 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.630
 I'll show you how it is so simple 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.370
 fork 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:58.570
 small can and large and small 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:05:00.370
 more convenient 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.139
 It seems this is the most convenient way and the most 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.960
 quick like this dumpling turned out 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:12.490
 if the dough has dried around the edges 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.979
 often happens when you see dumplings 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.930
 you just need to wet the edges of this test 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:23.200
 same water from under the potatoes to 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.479
 jam well mated already molded and 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.280
 dumplings need to put on the board and 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.220
 cover with a dumpling so that the dumplings do not 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.620
 dried up while you like other dumplings 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.910
 dumplings can do a lot in store and 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.479
 freeze right so cover up on the board 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.950
 wrap and put in the freezer for 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:49.330
 cooking dumplings bring water to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:52.570
 Boiling add some salt and one omit 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.720
 dumplings in boiling water so they carried 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.500
 palettes 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.650
 dumplings need to boil in a large 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.009
 the amount of water again so they don't 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.009
 stuck together 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:09.090
 stir in the dumplings are not stuck to 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:11.819
 the bottom of the pan and cook the dumplings 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.699
 without a cover until they float on 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.629
 the surface well vamps all of you 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.319
 now they can be removed and laid out 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.840
 on a plate 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.970
 ready dumplings served with some 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.250
 good olive oil in my 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:31.110
 case is great and extra virgin that is 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.419
 unrefined olive oil is very 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.509
 tasty good 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:40.849
 or can be served with sour cream well, who 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.849

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.030
