first person and then we started to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
first person and then we started to
think<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.920> guitar<00:01:02.280> hero<00:01:02.520> is

a<00:01:02.640> game<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> guitar

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a game and if you think about it guitar

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.620 
a game and if you think about it guitar
here<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> game<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> note<00:01:05.939> highway<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
here as a game it's the note highway and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.080 
here as a game it's the note highway and
that's<00:01:07.350> almost<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.610> everything<00:01:08.939> behind

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that's almost it so everything behind

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
that's almost it so everything behind
the<00:01:09.390> note<00:01:09.570> highway<00:01:09.960> its<00:01:10.140> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the note highway its kind of this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
the note highway its kind of this
secondary<00:01:11.100> thing<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
secondary thing you know it's not like a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
secondary thing you know it's not like a
call<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.689> duty<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:13.080> skylanders<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
call of duty or skylanders where you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
call of duty or skylanders where you
need<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> run<00:01:14.369> around<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> level<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.299> fun

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
need to run around the level to have fun

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
need to run around the level to have fun
it's<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.140> actually<00:01:16.409> slightly<00:01:16.560> detached<00:01:16.920> so

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's it's actually slightly detached so

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
it's it's actually slightly detached so
we<00:01:17.850> were<00:01:18.000> able<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.869> tell<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> story

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
we were able to use it to tell a story

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.530 
we were able to use it to tell a story
which<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.400> great<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:21.210> once<00:01:21.390> you've

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
which was really great now once you've

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.670 
which was really great now once you've
got<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.020> head<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.619> well

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
got that in your head and you think well

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.109 
got that in your head and you think well

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
slightly we made the leap to say well it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940 
slightly we made the leap to say well it
doesn't<00:01:26.850> need<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.150> 3d<00:01:27.659> people<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.829> just

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
doesn't need to be 3d people we can just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.830 
doesn't need to be 3d people we can just
film<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.759> tell<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
well there's going to be several bands

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
well there's going to be several bands
in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.420> game<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.350> they're<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.619> different

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
in the game so they're all different

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
in the game so they're all different
names<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.460> ones<00:01:41.610> we've<00:01:41.790> seen<00:01:41.820> today<00:01:42.150> are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
names the ones we've seen today are

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.660 
names the ones we've seen today are
called<00:01:42.600> our<00:01:42.780> paths<00:01:43.020> collide<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.610> were

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
called our paths collide and they were

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.750 
called our paths collide and they were
playing<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:46.140> fall<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.710> boy<00:01:46.860> track

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
playing the the fall out boy track

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.270 
playing the the fall out boy track
and<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.170> way<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.890> built<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and you know the way we kind of built it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.390 
and you know the way we kind of built it
is<00:01:50.550> we<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:52.110> wanted<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> build<00:01:52.620> bands<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.190> look

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
is we we wanted to build bands that look

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.480 
is we we wanted to build bands that look
like<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.790> would<00:01:53.910> play<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.360> genre<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.990> music

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
like they would play that genre of music

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.920 
like they would play that genre of music
so<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.760> rehearse<00:01:56.940> different<00:01:57.570> people

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so we would rehearse different people

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.240 
so we would rehearse different people
and<00:01:58.170> we'd<00:01:58.290> bring<00:01:58.530> different<00:01:58.680> people<00:01:59.130> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and we'd bring different people in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
and we'd bring different people in
individually<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.150> then<00:02:00.570> once<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.930> saw<00:02:01.110> some

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
individually and then once we saw some

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
individually and then once we saw some
people<00:02:01.410> we<00:02:01.620> really<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.070> would<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.400> bring

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
people we really like would then bring

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
people we really like would then bring
them<00:02:02.730> back<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> band<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.930> put<00:02:04.170> them

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
them back as a band and put them

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.530 
them back as a band and put them
together<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.430> them<00:02:05.580> rehearse<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
together and then have them rehearse the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.480 
together and then have them rehearse the
kind<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> tracks<00:02:07.260> as<00:02:07.440> well<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.369> when

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
kind of the tracks as well so then when

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.620 
kind of the tracks as well so then when
we<00:02:08.580> did<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.760> we<00:02:09.119> started<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.540> about

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
we did that we started to think about

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.180 
we did that we started to think about
what<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.080> stage<00:02:10.380> will<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.740> put<00:02:10.890> them<00:02:11.070> on

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
what kind of stage will we put them on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.340 
what kind of stage will we put them on
and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.390> start<00:02:12.660> designing<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.080> stage

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and then we start designing the stage

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.410 
and then we start designing the stage
out<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:13.980> we'd<00:02:14.370> build<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.330> we

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
out and we'd build that out and then we

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
out and we'd build that out and then we
designed<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> crowd<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> crowd<00:02:16.920> look

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
designed the crowd out so the crowd look

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
designed the crowd out so the crowd look
like<00:02:17.400> they're<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.120> gig<00:02:18.360> as

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
like they're be going to that gig as

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.050 
like they're be going to that gig as
well<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.960> each<00:02:19.350> genre<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:20.040> music<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.670> kind

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
well so each genre of music is it kind

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.540 
well so each genre of music is it kind
of<00:02:21.120> fits<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.600> band<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.860> then<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.280> fits

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
of fits the band and then and it fits

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.250 
of fits the band and then and it fits
the<00:02:23.670> crowd<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.240> think<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.720> hardest<00:02:24.810> part<00:02:25.050> was

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
the crowd I think the hardest part was

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.950 
the crowd I think the hardest part was
coming<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.680> band<00:02:25.860> names<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:27.420> speaking

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
coming up with band names and speaking

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.480 
coming up with band names and speaking
of<00:02:28.050> crowds<00:02:28.260> talking<00:02:28.560> about<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.830> variety<00:02:29.190> of

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
of crowds talking about the variety of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.370 
of crowds talking about the variety of
crowds<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.000> people<00:02:30.300> will<00:02:30.420> evolve<00:02:30.960> through

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
crowds that people will evolve through

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.430 
crowds that people will evolve through
yeah<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.550> each<00:02:32.760> each<00:02:33.300> song<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.900> filmed<00:02:34.380> in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
yeah so like each each song is filmed in

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.780 
yeah so like each each song is filmed in
a<00:02:34.530> unique<00:02:34.830> saying<00:02:35.190> all<00:02:35.430> right<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:35.760> you're

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
a unique saying all right so you're

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610 
a unique saying all right so you're
going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.330> unique<00:02:36.690> set<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.260> crowd

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
going to have a unique set of crowd

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.800 
going to have a unique set of crowd
you're<00:02:38.280> going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.460> have<00:02:38.550> unique<00:02:39.360> reactions

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
you're going to have unique reactions

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.840 
you're going to have unique reactions
throughout<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.290> song<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.790> we're<00:02:41.790> actually

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
throughout the song and we're actually

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.640 
throughout the song and we're actually
kind<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:43.050> think<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.320> each<00:02:43.440> song

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
kind of if you think about each song

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.410 
kind of if you think about each song
being<00:02:43.890> kind<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.730> neat<00:02:44.880> when<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.120> announce<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
being kind of neat when we announce the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.910 
being kind of neat when we announce the
songs<00:02:45.750> you'll<00:02:45.959> get<00:02:46.080> an<00:02:46.170> idea<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.709> how

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
songs you'll get an idea of just how

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.230 
songs you'll get an idea of just how
many<00:02:48.020> crowds<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.350> did<00:02:49.590> film<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.730> think

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
many crowds we did film but I'm I think

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.420 
many crowds we did film but I'm I think
over<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> course<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.020> project<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:53.010> know

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
over the course of the project you know

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.550 
over the course of the project you know
in<00:02:53.489> each<00:02:53.610> set<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.090> between<00:02:54.300> 200<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.020> 400

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
in each set we have between 200 and 400

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.500 
in each set we have between 200 and 400
people<00:02:55.860> which<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:56.760> green<00:02:57.000> screened<00:02:57.360> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
people which we then green screened and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.330 
people which we then green screened and
use<00:02:57.660> some<00:02:57.810> tech<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.500> turn<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.890> into<00:02:58.950> about

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
use some tech and turn them into about

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.120 
use some tech and turn them into about
5,000<00:03:00.120> people<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:01.320> gets<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.650> lot<00:03:01.770> bigger<00:03:01.980> than

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
5,000 people it gets a lot bigger than

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.890 
5,000 people it gets a lot bigger than
that<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:02.790> that's<00:03:02.910> real<00:03:03.180> people<00:03:03.540> before<00:03:03.810> you

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
mean we were trying to think of a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.150 
mean we were trying to think of a
setting<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:19.140> could<00:03:19.350> put<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.650> game<00:03:19.890> in

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
setting that we could put this game in

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.390 
setting that we could put this game in
that<00:03:20.370> felt<00:03:20.670> real<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.510> felt<00:03:21.810> current

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
that felt real but felt current

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.650 
that felt real but felt current
especially<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.030> we've<00:03:24.510> gone

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
especially with the kind of we've gone

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.150 
especially with the kind of we've gone
with<00:03:24.780> quite<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.959> broad<00:03:25.170> range<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.650> music<00:03:26.010> in

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
with quite a broad range of music in

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.130 
with quite a broad range of music in

festivals where the such diversity of
music<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.050> allows<00:03:37.350> us<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.370> put<00:03:38.580> different

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
music it allows us to to put different

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.140 
music it allows us to to put different
types<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.390> music<00:03:39.600> together<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.320> one<00:03:40.980> place<00:03:41.220> but

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
types of music together in one place but

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.850 
types of music together in one place but
look<00:03:42.420> differently<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.410> different

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
look differently and have a different

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.470 
look differently and have a different
reaction<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.340> each<00:03:44.459> thing<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.330> just

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
reaction to each thing so it just

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.809 
reaction to each thing so it just
provided<00:03:45.959> something<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.410> felt<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.920> cool

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
provided something that felt so cool

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.179 
provided something that felt so cool
and<00:03:48.209> one<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.689> key<00:03:49.200> parts<00:03:49.499> of<00:03:49.709> all<00:03:49.859> this<00:03:50.010> is

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
and one of the key parts of all this is

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.470 
and one of the key parts of all this is
the<00:03:50.219> new<00:03:50.430> guitar<00:03:50.849> can<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.150> talk<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.359> little

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
the new guitar can you talk a little

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.190 
the new guitar can you talk a little
about<00:03:51.629> how<00:03:52.409> you<00:03:52.469> guys<00:03:52.739> designed<00:03:53.249> that<00:03:53.959> yeah<00:03:54.959> so

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
about how you guys designed that yeah so

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.110 
about how you guys designed that yeah so
I<00:03:55.230> mean<00:03:55.319> at<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.859> early<00:03:56.099> stages<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.639> design<00:03:56.909> we

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
I mean at the early stages of design we

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.429 
I mean at the early stages of design we
were<00:03:57.239> trying<00:03:57.510> lots<00:03:57.689> of<00:03:57.870> different<00:03:57.930> prototypes

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
were trying lots of different prototypes

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.140 
were trying lots of different prototypes
of<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.950> guitar<00:03:59.249> and<00:03:59.489> lots<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.790> different

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
of the guitar and lots of different

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.449 
of the guitar and lots of different
configurations<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.530> we<00:04:01.859> really<00:04:02.159> kind<00:04:02.280> of

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
configurations and and we really kind of

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.729 
configurations and and we really kind of
thought<00:04:02.639> about<00:04:02.909> how<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.420> broad<00:04:04.379> range<00:04:04.560> of

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
thought about how a broad range of

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.199 
thought about how a broad range of
people<00:04:04.920> played<00:04:05.250> on<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.579> which<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:05.939> kind<00:04:06.150> of

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
people played on this which was kind of

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.490 
people played on this which was kind of
the<00:04:06.299> medium<00:04:06.599> place<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.049> know<00:04:07.109> I<00:04:07.139> was<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> big

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
the medium place you know I was a big

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.160 
the medium place you know I was a big
portion<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.980> people<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:09.810> know<00:04:09.930> just

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
portion of people and you know just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.360 
portion of people and you know just
playing<00:04:10.409> with<00:04:10.530> three<00:04:10.680> fingers<00:04:10.950> was<00:04:11.340> something

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
playing with three fingers was something

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.759 
playing with three fingers was something
that<00:04:11.819> people<00:04:12.180> got<00:04:12.269> very<00:04:12.329> comfortable<00:04:13.049> with<00:04:13.109> we

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
that people got very comfortable with we

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.679 
that people got very comfortable with we
started<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.129> think<00:04:14.310> about<00:04:14.519> how<00:04:14.700> can<00:04:14.760> we<00:04:14.969> build

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
started to think about how can we build

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.810 
started to think about how can we build
on<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:15.959> comfort<00:04:16.560> zone<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:17.250> actually<00:04:17.669> add

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
on that comfort zone but actually add

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.729 
on that comfort zone but actually add
some<00:04:18.090> depth<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.509> it<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.930> then<00:04:19.500> at<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.650> same

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
some depth to it and then at the same

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.140 
some depth to it and then at the same
time<00:04:20.070> how<00:04:20.280> can<00:04:20.489> we<00:04:20.579> kind<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.849> give<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
time how can we kind of give the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.060 
time how can we kind of give the
veterans<00:04:21.570> something<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.199> you<00:04:22.860> know<00:04:22.949> they

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
veterans something that you know they

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.320 
veterans something that you know they
can<00:04:23.220> come<00:04:23.400> back<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.669> learn<00:04:23.849> because<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.180> think

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
can come back and learn because I think

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.060 
can come back and learn because I think
if<00:04:24.419> we<00:04:24.509> just<00:04:24.539> put<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> same<00:04:25.020> game<00:04:25.259> out<00:04:25.470> all<00:04:25.860> our

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
if we just put the same game out all our

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.100 
if we just put the same game out all our
expert<00:04:26.400> players<00:04:26.699> would<00:04:27.419> know<00:04:27.539> how<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.720> play<00:04:28.020> it

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
expert players would know how to play it

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.839 
expert players would know how to play it
straight<00:04:28.349> away<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:29.280> wanted<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.550> give<00:04:29.759> them

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
straight away we wanted to give them

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.040 
straight away we wanted to give them
something<00:04:29.910> where<00:04:30.419> they<00:04:30.539> had<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.870> go<00:04:30.960> and

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
something where they had to go and

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.540 
something where they had to go and
relearn<00:04:31.470> something<00:04:31.889> a<00:04:31.979> little<00:04:32.160> bit<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.490> then

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
relearn something a little bit and then

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.550 
relearn something a little bit and then
master<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.270> again<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.990> have<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.320> new

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
master it again and and have a new

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.499 
master it again and and have a new
challenge<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.729> ended<00:04:36.000> up<00:04:36.090> becoming<00:04:36.240> a

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
challenge so that ended up becoming a

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.169 
challenge so that ended up becoming a
big<00:04:36.630> part<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.020> as<00:04:37.110> well
