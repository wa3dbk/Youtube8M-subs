00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.700
 we want to show here today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.630
 like a Hanoverian chef sausages 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.830
 make it go then it starts 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.840
 what do I need everything for mine 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.440
 Hanoverian chef mettwurst after 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.020
 Grabowski has that relatively easy again 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.760
 the lesson is already here from me 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.109
 I have pork belly and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000
 pig shoulder is we have already 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.300
 carted 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.130
 since there is usually only 12% to 13 14 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.790
 percent cook loss you have to do that then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 I calculate with my onions 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.640
 I mean that before sport 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.460
 spices do not appear on the defense 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 or are always under my video then 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.300
 I do the rest of the natural glasses 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.250
 usually i come in the art club 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.530
 do now an art-on for you so 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 he sees what she looks like then 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.300
 okay how the whole now runs the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280
 I show you now so meaty and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 belly I have stated here too 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.710
 already then I do that so the onion 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.140
 yes come with make pure already 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.490
 right up the spices with it and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.619
 then I leave all this through the wolf 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 and then of course I always have 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.290
 is through my Clearly this is first time 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.290
 something like that 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.869
 only the whole thing goes relatively fast 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.060
 nice delicious sausage so that I am now 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.630
 Here customers through how to do that quietly 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.799
 lets show that structurally 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.939
 you usually take three 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.319
 millimeter slices for you can use 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.130
 two millimeters slices and 1 4 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.530
 millimeter slices 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.630
 that's the head cracked actually 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 it is only partly with the green something 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.849
 to do 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.759
 ok how the whole thing runs after that 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.989
 I'll show you right away so I have that 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.239
 all well passed 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.709
 if you want something finer 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.530
 then a bit boiler could be too 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.299
 but if I go back 100 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.429
 to give milliliters of water so to eat 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.190
 boil water then of course I have to 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.119
 also that we calculate with salt 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.069
 pepper and so on 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.209
 I do not need it now 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.400
 Me too, not because it's a lived thing 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.400
 whole lot 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 have the whole now mixed well 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:43.980
 Now try that very important yes 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.959
 probably very simple 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.510
 I would take that and the rest 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.110
 because ever be how that now runs show 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.500
 I have you here now so I have here 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.200
 my art days again a piece of 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.069
 of course, put on top of it here so 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.739
 Alright, and then I do the whole thing 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.739
 Just fill in here again 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.120
 it will take a little bit 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.590
 I 'm making a sausage here for you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.140
 Normally I would do it all now 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:29.350
 into the glass make the whole thing short now 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:31.709
 press down a bit nicely 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.709
 firmly 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.500
 I think that's enough now even 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.650
 of course I have my ribbon again 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.650
 clearly 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.680
 Please spread the air 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.680
 bit goes out turning once 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:20.690
 the bit that now checks at 80 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:24.650
 grad about 50 55 minutes so 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:40.730
 small caliber okay the rest will 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:43.520
 course again clear I do that 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.670
 with the others too, like me here 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.230
 earlier the board is not too big now 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.210
 show that could also be with club channel 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:56.270
 everywhere see here just like the post in 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.250
 glass but if the where it is done then 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.380
 I'll show you again then until then 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.850
 equal 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.210
 my Hanoverian chef mettwurst after 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.070
 crossgate has cooled down 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.520
 and here I also cooked in 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.130
 Of course, I would like to do that now 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.940
 also incisive for you extra times 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.940
 look like she looks 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.259
 there is how delicious yes I can only say 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.039
 if i had my little docomo 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.210
