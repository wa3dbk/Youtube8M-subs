explain<00:01:56.319> it<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.069> kind<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.310> complex<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.030> it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
explain it it is kind of complex and it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.499 
explain it it is kind of complex and it
is<00:01:59.259> code<00:01:59.619> crafting<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.310> counter<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:01.420> I'm

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
is code crafting this counter so I'm

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.489 
is code crafting this counter so I'm
going<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.689> go<00:02:01.810> ahead<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:01.959> give<00:02:02.139> him<00:02:02.319> credit

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:02.499 
going to go ahead and give him credit

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.219 
going to go ahead and give him credit
for<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.920> yeah<00:02:03.670> he's<00:02:03.999> awesome<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:04.899> good<00:02:05.049> check

configure<00:02:11.319> how<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.500> build<00:02:11.680> encounter<00:02:12.130> for

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
configure how to build encounter for

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.670 
configure how to build encounter for
yourself<00:02:12.670> yeah<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.060> kinda<00:02:13.420> he<00:02:13.959> has<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.290> tutorial

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
yourself yeah be kinda he has a tutorial

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.840 
yourself yeah be kinda he has a tutorial
on<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:16.000> yeah<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.780> counter<00:02:17.140> oh<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
on it so yeah this is the counter oh the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.699 
on it so yeah this is the counter oh the
input<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.569> over<00:02:19.840> here<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.260> there's<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> button

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
input is over here and there's a button

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.780 
input is over here and there's a button
on<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> other<00:02:21.099> side<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.670> actually

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
on the other side but this is actually

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.880 
on the other side but this is actually
linked<00:02:22.300> up<00:02:22.390> pressure<00:02:22.840> plate<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.590> how<00:02:23.740> this

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
linked up pressure plate and how this

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.220 
linked up pressure plate and how this
works<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.580> every<00:02:24.730> time<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.420> redstone<00:02:25.780> pulses

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
works is every time the redstone pulses

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.520 
works is every time the redstone pulses
it<00:02:27.220> pops<00:02:27.819> up<00:02:28.030> all<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.450> Sam<00:02:28.630> but<00:02:29.050> only<00:02:29.290> one

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
it pops up all the Sam but only one

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.949 
it pops up all the Sam but only one
stays<00:02:29.830> because<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.940> redstone<00:02:31.480> output

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
stays because the redstone output

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.110 
stays because the redstone output
actually<00:02:32.410> causes<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.250> stink<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:33.910> every

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
actually causes it to stink so every

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.030 
actually causes it to stink so every
time<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.360> press<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.600> it'll<00:02:35.290> pop<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.680> next<00:02:35.890> one

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
time you press it it'll pop the next one

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.860 
time you press it it'll pop the next one
cause<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.550> say<00:02:36.760> pop<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.270> next<00:02:37.510> one<00:02:37.660> comes

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
cause it to say pop the next one comes

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870 
cause it to say pop the next one comes
to<00:02:38.050> stay<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.560> until<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.460> get<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.790> last

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
to stay and until you get to the last

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.510 
to stay and until you get to the last
one<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.570> then<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> outputs<00:02:41.290> are<00:02:41.770> all<00:02:42.010> along

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
one and then the outputs are all along

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.430 
one and then the outputs are all along
this<00:02:43.120> one<00:02:43.330> right<00:02:43.480> here<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.900> if<00:02:43.990> i<00:02:44.080> were<00:02:44.230> to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
this one right here so if i were to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.320 
this one right here so if i were to
toggle<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.220> by<00:02:45.400> pressing<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.940> button<00:02:46.000> here

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
toggle it by pressing this button here

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.020 
toggle it by pressing this button here
or<00:02:46.690> hitting<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.350> pressure<00:02:47.560> plate<00:02:47.760> see<00:02:48.760> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
or hitting the pressure plate see it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.290 
or hitting the pressure plate see it
i'll<00:02:49.150> pop<00:02:49.330> up<00:02:49.510> another<00:02:50.350> one<00:02:50.500> stays<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:51.760> another

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
i'll pop up another one stays up another

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.080 
i'll pop up another one stays up another
one<00:02:52.480> stays<00:02:52.720> they<00:02:53.380> all<00:02:53.530> pop<00:02:53.740> up<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.670> all<00:02:54.850> say

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
one stays they all pop up and it all say

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.220 
one stays they all pop up and it all say
so<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.450> would<00:02:55.570> be<00:02:55.600> at<00:02:55.750> four<00:02:55.990> casualties

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
so this would be at four casualties

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.870 
so this would be at four casualties
right<00:02:56.710> now<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.370> someone<00:02:57.550> else<00:02:57.760> would

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
right now but if someone else would

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.160 
right now but if someone else would
repress<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.120> again<00:02:58.390> nothing<00:02:58.720> what<00:02:58.840> happens

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
repress it again nothing what happens

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.750 
repress it again nothing what happens
that's<00:02:59.380> why<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> maximum<00:03:00.280> would<00:03:00.430> only<00:03:00.550> be

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that's why the maximum would only be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.940 
that's why the maximum would only be
four<00:03:01.060> or<00:03:01.090> greater<00:03:01.840> if<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.530> wanted<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.830> put

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
four or greater if you wanted to put

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.340 
four or greater if you wanted to put
that<00:03:03.100> on<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> side<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.090> reset<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.750> press

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
that on the side so to reset it to press

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.290 
that on the side so to reset it to press
this<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.740> now<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.370> should<00:03:06.520> be<00:03:06.610> back<00:03:06.820> at<00:03:07.000> zero

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
this and now it should be back at zero

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.190 
this and now it should be back at zero
casualties<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.400> all<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.390> it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
casualties so this all this is is it

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.590 
casualties so this all this is is it
basically<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:12.100> one<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.790> wiring<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.330> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
basically this one this wiring is the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.900 
basically this one this wiring is the
reset<00:03:13.930> button<00:03:13.960> from<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.830> outside<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.490> all

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
reset button from the outside and all

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.910 
reset button from the outside and all
these<00:03:16.180> outputs<00:03:16.690> just<00:03:17.020> link<00:03:17.320> up<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.800> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
these outputs just link up to the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.980 
these outputs just link up to the
redstone<00:03:18.310> torches<00:03:18.640> which<00:03:19.300> is<00:03:19.450> kind<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.780> pain

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
redstone torches which is kind of a pain

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.390 
redstone torches which is kind of a pain
trying<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.260> get<00:03:20.410> them<00:03:20.530> all<00:03:20.620> together<00:03:20.800> but<00:03:21.250> as

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
trying to get them all together but as

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.160 
trying to get them all together but as
you<00:03:21.520> can<00:03:21.610> see<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.330> redstone<00:03:22.690> torch<00:03:22.870> would<00:03:23.080> be

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
you can see the redstone torch would be

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.280 
you can see the redstone torch would be
all<00:03:23.290> right<00:03:23.440> here<00:03:23.770> 1<00:03:24.010> 2<00:03:24.310> 3<00:03:24.340> 4<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.180> 5

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
all right here 1 2 3 4 and 5

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.770 
all right here 1 2 3 4 and 5
respectively<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.950> yeah<00:03:27.330> that's<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.450> counter

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
respectively so yeah that's the counter

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.670 
respectively so yeah that's the counter
if<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.930> guys<00:03:29.050> want<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.320> figure<00:03:29.410> out<00:03:29.560> how<00:03:29.620> to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
if you guys want to figure out how to
