00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
prototypes for new troops this is the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.020 
prototypes for new troops this is the
first<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.469> ghost<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.370> tweaked<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
first one the ghost and I tweaked it a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
first one the ghost and I tweaked it a
little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
little bit so this is not this is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
little bit so this is not this is
actually<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.700> offline<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.480> could<00:00:42.660> say

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
actually kind of offline you could say

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.740 
actually kind of offline you could say
all<00:00:43.559> night<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.700> archers<00:00:45.149> goblins

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
all night and so are my archers goblins

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.889 
all night and so are my archers goblins
and<00:00:45.960> barbarians<00:00:46.730> but<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and barbarians but here with the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.910 
and barbarians but here with the
graphics<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:51.050> adharma<00:00:52.079> these<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.739> my

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
graphics it is my adharma these are my

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
graphics it is my adharma these are my
ghosts<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> ghosts<00:00:54.780> flying

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
ghosts so now we see the ghosts flying

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.549 
ghosts so now we see the ghosts flying
over<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> base<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.100> its<00:00:56.219> movement<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> just

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
over the base so its movement is just

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
over the base so its movement is just
yeah<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.039> special<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.120> looks

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
yeah it's not special but it looks

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.590 
yeah it's not special but it looks
awesome<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.289> actually<00:01:02.300> which<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
awesome and we see actually which is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
awesome and we see actually which is
because<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> prototype<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.519> kind<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
because with the prototype the kind of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.810 
because with the prototype the kind of
avatar<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.840> change<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> too<00:01:07.500> which<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
avatar they change it too which is and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
avatar they change it too which is and
maybe<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.380> mean<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.520> witches<00:01:12.330> will

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
maybe this will mean that witches will

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.880 
maybe this will mean that witches will
get<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:14.119> new<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.630> special<00:01:16.140> update<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.770> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
dies and sorry that it restarts guys but

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.610 
dies and sorry that it restarts guys but
it's<00:02:11.910> because<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> new<00:02:12.599> update<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.349> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it's because of the new update but it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's because of the new update but it
dies<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.129> doesn't<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.519> anything<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.030> fades

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
dies it doesn't do anything it fades

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.059 
dies it doesn't do anything it fades
ways<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.450> animation<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.409> when<00:02:19.830> a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
ways just like the animation of when a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.729 
ways just like the animation of when a
Pekka<00:02:20.430> dies<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:21.989> see<00:02:22.200> yeah<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.680> just

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
Pekka dies so we can see yeah it just

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.680 
Pekka dies so we can see yeah it just
does<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.190> same<00:02:23.280> as<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.060> does<00:02:24.269> right<00:02:24.510> now

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
does the same as like it does right now

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530 
does the same as like it does right now
so<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.260> troupe<00:02:25.500> dies<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:26.159> skeleton<00:02:27.120> come

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
so if a troupe dies a skeleton come

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.380 
so if a troupe dies a skeleton come
ghost<00:02:28.379> comes<00:02:28.709> out<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> right<00:02:29.610> arises

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
ghost comes out of it and right arises

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.559 
ghost comes out of it and right arises
up<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.200> very<00:02:31.680> big<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.329> so<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.510> is

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
up but this is a very big one so this is

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.869 
up but this is a very big one so this is
the<00:02:33.840> first<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.069> three<00:02:37.069> prototypes<00:02:38.069> let's

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
the first of the three prototypes let's

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.289 
the first of the three prototypes let's
head<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.629> next<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.700> next<00:02:42.000> one

the giant Lowell a mole but in the

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.039 
the giant Lowell a mole but in the
prototype<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:56.190> says<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.670> mole<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.390> actually

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
prototype it says a mole but actually

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.190 
prototype it says a mole but actually
this<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> first<00:02:58.950> time<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> see<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.930> our

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
this is the first time I see it it our

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
this is the first time I see it it our
hog<00:03:01.470> riders<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:03.000> does<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.390> same<00:03:03.659> as

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
hog riders and it just does the same as

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.849 
hog riders and it just does the same as
a<00:03:03.900> hog<00:03:04.170> rider<00:03:05.239> at<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.599> very<00:03:06.959> moment<00:03:07.200> does<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
a hog rider at this very moment does the

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.130 
a hog rider at this very moment does the
same<00:03:08.069> as<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> hog<00:03:08.519> rider<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:09.510> nothing<00:03:09.959> special

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
same as a hog rider so nothing special

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.970 
same as a hog rider so nothing special
actually<00:03:10.890> if<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:11.790> train<00:03:12.450> one<00:03:12.750> yeah<00:03:13.260> let's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
actually if we just train one yeah let's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.640 
actually if we just train one yeah let's
see<00:03:14.159> what<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.489> going<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> happen<00:03:18.139> it<00:03:19.139> probably

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
see what was going to happen it probably

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.440 
see what was going to happen it probably
does<00:03:19.859> exactly<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.579> same<00:03:20.609> as<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> hog<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:21.389> at

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
does exactly the same as a hog right at

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.420 
does exactly the same as a hog right at
the<00:03:21.540> moment<00:03:21.690> maybe<00:03:22.079> if<00:03:22.319> we<00:03:22.500> attack<00:03:22.919> it's<00:03:23.160> going

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
the moment maybe if we attack it's going

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.759 
the moment maybe if we attack it's going
to<00:03:23.549> go<00:03:23.700> beneath<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.419> ground<00:03:24.660> let's<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.739> a

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
to go beneath the ground let's have a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.789 
to go beneath the ground let's have a
quick<00:03:26.099> look<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.639> we<00:03:26.940> attack<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.410> here<00:03:28.650> in

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
quick look if we attack so here in

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:38.150 
quick look if we attack so here in
natural<00:03:29.250> defense<00:03:30.379> let's<00:03:31.489> see<00:03:32.489> oh<00:03:35.629> oh<00:03:36.629> in<00:03:37.440> a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
natural defense let's see oh oh in a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.030 
natural defense let's see oh oh in a
later<00:03:38.370> video<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.569> depth<00:03:40.200> explain<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
later video I will in depth explain the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.580 
later video I will in depth explain the
gameplay<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.730> what<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.090> does<00:03:42.359> but<00:03:43.230> did<00:03:43.440> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
gameplay and what it does but did you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.199 
gameplay and what it does but did you
see<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:43.859> guys<00:03:44.129> it<00:03:44.430> was<00:03:44.579> like<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> ghost

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
see that guys it was like the ghost

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.789 
see that guys it was like the ghost
version<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.919> hog<00:03:47.519> rider<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:48.180> was<00:03:48.449> slow<00:03:48.900> but

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
version of a hog rider it was slow but

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.439 
version of a hog rider it was slow but
it<00:03:49.889> was<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> ghost<00:03:50.340> version<00:03:50.849> probably<00:03:51.269> goes

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
it was a ghost version probably goes

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.559 
it was a ghost version probably goes
under<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.169> ground<00:03:52.410> but<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:53.459> can<00:03:54.060> really<00:03:54.329> see

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
under the ground but we can really see

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.470 
under the ground but we can really see
that<00:03:54.599> well<00:03:55.199> when<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:56.120> actually<00:03:57.120> do

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
that well when I can actually do

funny<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:49.030> see<00:04:50.520> also<00:04:51.520> dies<00:04:52.419> pretty<00:04:52.900> fast<00:04:53.199> has

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
funny to see also dies pretty fast has

but maybe this would say that like the
minion<00:05:00.460> can<00:05:00.760> give<00:05:01.000> birth<00:05:01.300> or<00:05:01.780> when<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.560> minion
