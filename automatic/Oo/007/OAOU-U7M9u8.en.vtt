00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.649 

let<00:01:43.850> me<00:01:43.939> open<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.329> same<00:01:44.630> block

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.249 

okay<00:01:48.499> i'm<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:49.659> approximately<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.780> same<00:01:50.990> page

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
okay i'm on approximately the same page

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.779 
okay i'm on approximately the same page
here<00:01:51.469> this<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:51.770> not<00:01:51.890> really<00:01:52.039> scientific

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
here this is not really scientific

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.730 
here this is not really scientific
because<00:01:52.969> they're<00:01:53.149> not<00:01:53.359> exactly<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.530> same

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
because they're not exactly the same

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.779 
because they're not exactly the same
page<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:57.219> font<00:01:58.219> size<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.520> everything

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
page and and font size and everything

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.399 
page and and font size and everything
but<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.299> pretty<00:01:59.450> close<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.049> i'll<00:02:00.140> give<00:02:00.319> you

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
but it's pretty close so i'll give you

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.510 
but it's pretty close so i'll give you
an<00:02:00.560> idea<00:02:00.709> of<00:02:00.920> how<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.219> speed<00:02:02.030> varies

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.000 

it<00:02:10.120> is<00:02:10.270> faster<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.350> not<00:02:11.560> only<00:02:11.680> faster

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it is faster and it's not only faster

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.840 
it is faster and it's not only faster
turning<00:02:15.010> pages<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.760> faster<00:02:17.850> navigating

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
turning pages it's faster navigating

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.780 
turning pages it's faster navigating
around

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.750 

I'll<00:02:28.510> show<00:02:28.780> another<00:02:29.219> picture<00:02:30.219> here<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.549> cover

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
I'll show another picture here the cover

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.490 
I'll show another picture here the cover
of<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:31.090> book<00:02:31.150> which<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.810> contained<00:02:32.200> by

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
Christian cantera can't drop it's pretty

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:48.540 
Christian cantera can't drop it's pretty
intricate<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.489> kind<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.180> an<00:02:37.329> interesting

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.190 

I'm<00:02:49.090> not<00:02:49.300> sure<00:02:49.480> how<00:02:49.600> well<00:02:49.780> that's<00:02:49.990> going<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
I'm not sure how well that's going to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.920 
I'm not sure how well that's going to
show<00:02:50.380> up<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> video<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:51.600> pictures<00:02:52.600> are

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
show up on the video but pictures are

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.900 
show up on the video but pictures are
just<00:02:53.260> much<00:02:53.470> better<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:55.540> text<00:02:56.400> also<00:02:57.400> which

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
just much better and the text also which

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.520 
just much better and the text also which
is<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.210> most<00:02:58.360> important<00:02:58.870> thing<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.380> text<00:02:59.770> is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
is the most important thing the text is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.190 
is the most important thing the text is

is<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.870> it's<00:03:46.870> quite<00:03:47.290> good<00:03:48.750> it's<00:03:49.750> definitely

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
is so it's quite good it's definitely

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.740 
is so it's quite good it's definitely
worth<00:03:50.860> having<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.820> smaller<00:03:52.090> size<00:03:52.390> kindle
