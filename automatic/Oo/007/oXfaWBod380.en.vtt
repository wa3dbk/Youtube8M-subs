if<00:01:10.609> we<00:01:10.789> look<00:01:10.999> back<00:01:11.210> at<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.569> screen<00:01:12.490> right<00:01:13.490> here

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
if we look back at the screen right here

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.779 
if we look back at the screen right here
this<00:01:14.689> was<00:01:15.289> blocked<00:01:15.679> out<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.130> would<00:01:16.280> not<00:01:16.459> solve

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
this was blocked out it would not solve

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.960 
this was blocked out it would not solve
it<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:18.350> we're<00:01:18.530> not<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:18.950> over<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.369> aim

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
it so we're not so over that aim

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.670 
it so we're not so over that aim
or<00:01:20.030> an<00:01:20.330> applique<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:23.300> everywhere<00:01:24.050> you<00:01:24.530> would

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
or an applique so everywhere you would

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.830 
or an applique so everywhere you would
want<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.070> stop<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.910> would<00:01:26.060> take<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
want to stop it you would take this and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.550 
want to stop it you would take this and
then<00:01:27.050> do<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.470> little<00:01:27.800> blocking<00:01:28.700> out<00:01:29.560> okay

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
then do that little blocking out okay

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.060 
then do that little blocking out okay
and<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.730> demonstrate<00:01:31.970> another<00:01:32.570> one<00:01:33.200> I'll<00:01:33.530> just

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
and to demonstrate another one I'll just

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.740 
and to demonstrate another one I'll just
randomly<00:01:34.430> picture<00:01:37.390> right<00:01:38.390> here

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
