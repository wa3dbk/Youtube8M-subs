00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 Good girl, I left eight points already. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.330
 hazelnuts for 4 people each is good 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.490
 stayed 12345678 now i did all three 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.630
 dots , and will close with a point 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 download here or at the beginning of this page 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.830
 I will introduce the needle that make a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.519
 low point 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.519
 I'm going to give three high points in here 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:43.760
 and I make three as I had and one stitch 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 answering a little here to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:01.949
 nodding had three more points 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:05.850
 within the same school 2003 gives 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:10.310
 one more little trick here 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.760
 same school I'm going to make a low 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 right 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.049
 So the first stone of mine was gone. 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.920
 following all around the sheet one 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.430
 Hight point 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.909
 three highlights and three co inpe 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.770
 high points and a low all 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.250
 within the same 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.250
 Right now, let's continue. 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.070
 So the boy had made eight 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.950
 points the villain pull the three chains and 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 there we made a low three 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.830
 3 high points to stay 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.540
 three high points and one low 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.580
 within the same school 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.690
 Let's go to school next to a point. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.870
 low three points high 3 chains 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.000
 three high points a low hour 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.960
 Let's do this all the way around. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.360
 of the flower that we are going to make let's close 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.610
 a low point in the first point 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.420
 down here we did the first 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.790
 stone 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:26.160
 now we're going to pull the line here open 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.160
 here it is between the sting and the needles 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.450
 needle is inserted here and here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:42.820
 and we'll make a point so we'll do 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.340
 here five chains 3 4 and 5 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.070
 the same thing here is going to have to stay 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.560
 opening to be right in the middle 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.730
 then we will introduce the needle that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:01.380
 between the three high points introduce 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:07.140
 here and make a low but five 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:10.930
 chains three three four five 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.830
 opens again to catch that prissy 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 in the middle and produce needle behind and here 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 O 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.310
 between 22 points hazelnuts and we will make a 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:30.040
 next low to continue 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.800
 others the girls were very well and 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.700
 girls then look how it turned inside out 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.770
 of our forest were one two three 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.650
 four five six seven eight rings 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.230
 here we are going to close here with a 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.530
 extremely low point 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.030
 so I finished the ball at 8:00 a.m. 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.450
 from behind 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:03.070
 I'm going to work the same way the one 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.070
 low three points high 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:25.389
 23 high points but 3.3 chains to 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:36.580
 to do the sting inside the same school I will 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:39.430
 make three high points 23 and close 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.889
 within the same angola the low 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.990
 so you notice that here is the 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.720
 our first stone she will stay 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.970
 located between the two stones of the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.240
 first career รณ and so I go 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.840
 to continue around her all over 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:03.210
 under this flower is very difficult to do 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.210
 There you will make three high points 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.810
 at that point used 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:21.569
 in two three chains I do it stayed 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.569
 plus three high points 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:34.560
 23 But that the highs and lows me and 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.190
 I'm going to do this around her every 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.460
 girls 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.040
 Then I finished the same way of the 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.340
 first part a low three 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.710
 high points three customers explained three 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.560
 high points a low and will follow 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.840
 so all the way back here it has 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.780
 that low first low 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.880
 people produce needle here and closes with 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.250
 very low point and the 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.370
 new flower 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.370
 now for example who wants because she 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.270
 you can make it an application in 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.460
 work or be secured 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.700
 Do you want to continue with the work? 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.150
 do same process with s neck or go 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:27.070
 open here to be able to insert the needle 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:30.910
 behind and enter the woman here there 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:39.580
 will make a very low point and 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:42.400
 makes but seven chains 4567 making the 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.420
 rings and come with a 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.420
 green part 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.530
 the first school is already made here O 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.660
 I come with the green part, I hope. 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.440
 that I have helped you to have 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:02.050
 I like Denise Caetano, I hope 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.020
 understand that I actually made this video 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.670
 I asked okay and a kiss to all 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.670
