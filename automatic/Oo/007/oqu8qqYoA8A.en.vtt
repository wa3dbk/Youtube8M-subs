holographic now before we start let me
explain<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> setup<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.680> little<00:00:22.710> bit

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
explain the setup a little bit

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240 
explain the setup a little bit
Darrin<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.060> wearing<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.810> hololens<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.590> he

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
Darrin is wearing at hololens and he

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
Darrin is wearing at hololens and he
sees<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.670> globe<00:00:27.119> oh<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:28.140> showed<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.529> in

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
sees this globe oh we showed you in

sees this globe oh we showed you in
January<00:00:29.029> ride<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> his<00:00:30.359> world<00:00:30.740> now<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.800> also

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
January ride in his world now we also

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
January ride in his world now we also
have<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> custom<00:00:32.850> camera<00:00:33.180> rig<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:34.050> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
have this custom camera rig over here so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
have this custom camera rig over here so
that<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> Holograms<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.660> on

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that you can see the Holograms up on

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
that you can see the Holograms up on
these<00:00:37.110> screens<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> camera<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
these screens as if the camera is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
these screens as if the camera is
wearing<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> hololens<00:00:40.500> now<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.550> we

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
wearing a hololens now when we

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
wearing a hololens now when we
introduced<00:00:42.210> Windows<00:00:42.690> holographic<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:44.100> globe

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

was<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> slide<00:00:46.010> today<00:00:47.270> Darren<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
was just a slide today Darren is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
was just a slide today Darren is
experiencing<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.969> universal<00:00:50.969> Windows

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
experiencing it as a universal Windows

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
experiencing it as a universal Windows
app<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> guess<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:53.129> running<00:00:53.670> on

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
app and guess what it's running on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.170 
app and guess what it's running on
Windows<00:00:54.539> 10<00:00:55.309> welcome<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.820> Windows

Windows 10 welcome to Windows
holographic<00:00:57.949> this<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.280> life<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.940> Holograms

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
holographic this is life with Holograms

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.650 
holographic this is life with Holograms
and<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.760> Darren<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:03.090> customized

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and as you can see Darren has customized

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
and as you can see Darren has customized
his<00:01:03.809> space<00:01:04.080> instead<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> digging<00:01:05.309> through

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
his space instead of digging through

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.230 
his space instead of digging through
menus<00:01:06.150> everything<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:08.880> wants

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
menus everything is right where he wants

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
menus everything is right where he wants
it<00:01:09.330> yeah<00:01:09.900> whether<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.350> Microsoft<00:01:10.950> edge

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it yeah whether it's Microsoft edge

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.300 
it yeah whether it's Microsoft edge
photos<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.450> video<00:01:12.720> apps<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.920> simply

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
photos or video apps these are simply

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340 
photos or video apps these are simply
Universal<00:01:15.060> windows<00:01:15.360> apps<00:01:15.390> though<00:01:16.200> we've

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Universal windows apps though we've

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
Universal windows apps though we've
placed<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.799> Holograms<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.970> whether<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
placed as Holograms so whether it's a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080 
placed as Holograms so whether it's a
slate<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> wall<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.490> something<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> little

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
slate on the wall or something a little

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
slate on the wall or something a little
bit<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.450> dimensional<00:01:22.310> like<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.490> loyal

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
bit more dimensional like my loyal

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
bit more dimensional like my loyal
companion<00:01:24.090> Fang<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.049> hey<00:01:25.409> buddy<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.460> can

now<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> add<00:01:30.150> something<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.840> space

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
now I want to add something to my space

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
now I want to add something to my space
so<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.369> pull<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.670> holographic

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so I'm going to pull up my holographic

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.800 
so I'm going to pull up my holographic
Start<00:01:33.659> menu<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.200> I'm<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> open<00:01:37.650> up

this<00:02:03.659> stage<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.290> an<00:02:04.469> example<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.189> modeled

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this stage as an example is modeled

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.150 
this stage as an example is modeled
after<00:02:06.149> Darren's<00:02:06.780> apartment<00:02:06.920> yeah<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
after Darren's apartment yeah and this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
after Darren's apartment yeah and this
is<00:02:08.369> where<00:02:08.550> I'd<00:02:08.700> hang<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.209> my<00:02:09.300> apartment

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
is where I'd hang out in my apartment

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.999 
is where I'd hang out in my apartment
and<00:02:10.050> surround<00:02:10.349> myself<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.800> the
