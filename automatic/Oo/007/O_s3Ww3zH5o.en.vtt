00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
little stock the chemical hand this part

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.080 
little stock the chemical hand this part
will<00:01:38.759> connect<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> hand<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> should

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
will connect to the hand and it should

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
will connect to the hand and it should
be<00:01:42.630> connecting<00:01:43.290> easily<00:01:46.250> like<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:50.310> you
