00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.980
 hello and welcome matthias 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 here i have the recipe four tray in 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.210
 the hand sony xperia z4 tablet is so called 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.279
 the very same way as has now 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.510
 in the framework of the mwc we presented 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.460
 could have been a few days earlier 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.079
 look and show up today 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.279
 just in time for the expiration of the ndr and that is 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.810
 I think really completely 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.130
 become pretty tablet if you want 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.829
 that's what we're after 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.599
 to look at the nearness 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.630
 absolute highlight is in my eyes 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:40.910
 the display is really bright 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.560
 and super christian 2560 x 1600 pixel that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.610
 in over four million pixels on his 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.130
 small display 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.010
 so that the tablet comes on pixeldichte 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.550
 from 300 dpi so really crazy 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.550
 not yet said that's right 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 10.1 a 10.1 inch display beautiful 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.240
 I think the display is really fast 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.430
 Here you can see the colors are too 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.699
 really great 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.340
 absolute highlight of this tablet s 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.170
 Another highlight in my eyes that 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.590
 the first tablet i know in the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.840
 the new snapdragon 810 for use 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.780
 So comes the absolute top model 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.579
 the current mobile processors 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.880
 built in here is supported by 3 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.210
 gb ram and of course comes then 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.359
 accordingly also with category 6 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.369
 and yet it is extremely light so that 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.259
 is less than 400 grams I know completely 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.009
 exactly what feels super easier is 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.649
 very thin 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.619
 really very very thin with 6 1 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.530
 Millimeters for the price sony has us 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.740
 meant the whole is so 650 euro 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.689
 costs in the Lte variant so then 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.779
 probably in the wlan variant the 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.909
 not very clear yet so is the price 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.189
 probably around 80 to 100 euros 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.779
 less probably already now the 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.149
 cards are below we have classic ones 

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:01.159
 micro usb port that is below 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.020
 actually the right side then here 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.349
 on the upper side we have here 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.929
 again a flap for micro sd cards 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.099
 probably up to 128 gigabytes and again 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.830
 Here underneath I do that even 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.420
 not up 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.860
 also hides the small sled 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.030
 for the sim cards 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.370
 Here we have a microphone hole 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.200
 on the right side a small entrance 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.940
 for a jack plug so his name is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 can one be headset respectively 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.740
 his microphone connect then come 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.810
 we have here on the left side 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.200
 Here you can reach a tasty one 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.450
 which also sony typically very well fulfilled 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.480
 is and feels great and here is one 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.060
 loud soft seesaw the edge shines here 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.180
 Incidentally, to be made of plastic and the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.850
 Edges are made of metal reinforced that 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.050
 should of course crashes and so on 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.600
 help further 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.860
 and whoever stays ahead here enough 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.470
 you can see on the right and on the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.700
 left side a small slit here 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.350
 inside hide the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.970
 stereo speakers I always think great 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.310
 especially with the leaves like tablets 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.310
 if stereo speakers were installed 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.470
 because well monogamous just when do you 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.380
 often with the hands behind 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.930
 loudspeaker cover else is coming 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.100
 up here a front camera for use 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.959
 a 5 megapixel front camera with one 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.450
 Fish eyes lenses eye lens on it 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.000
 and on the back the camera here 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.510
 on the right has eight 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.800
 Sorry but 8 megapixels and one 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.560
 Trying a little bit does it all 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.420
 Ordinary images so that it only insofar 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.269
 times correctly to the internal blocked 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.610
 memory 32 gb in the lte variant 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.730
 finally who will remember it 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.850
 can the predecessor, although there were 32 gb in 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.610
 the wlan variant but only 16 gb in the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.080
 lte variant the battery is in here 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.810
 Incidentally, the same remained with 6000 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.940
 milliard hours but this time 17 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.510
 instead of 13 hours the part in life 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.090
 receive 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.800
 on demand told and sony that 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.840
 this is mainly due to the new one 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.269
 processor the era reached the cores 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 more efficient and thus completely 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.340
 Neat energy obviously saves 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.070
 So I think it's really good then only 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.890
 Show us and sony has us 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.830
 here also an accessory brought 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.090
 and that is a docking station the 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.090
 how I think is really succeeded is supposed 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.510
 179 euros cost vp and 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.419
 just like the z4 tablet at the end of june 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.270
 come and we are here we have the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.610
 a real mouse pad with it 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.930
 I think that's very chic the buttons 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.370
 Feeling really good when you are 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.880
 drÃ¼ber drives made right 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.889
 Send impressive what you then also 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.650
 I really liked that, too 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.330
 easy is not so well known and of 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.169
 design technically well solved you know 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.949
 not if you can see it if you do that now 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.290
 works backwards then goes 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.820
 keyboard in angle upwards and thereby 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.520
 then it can be a bit 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.919
 write more pleasant and overall 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.900
 not only protects this keyboard but also 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:08.590
 It makes Sony Xperia Z4 tablet too 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.020
 actually such a nearly full-fledged one 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.539
 computer so that 's it for now 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.850
 far from me and our first impression 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.229
 by sony xperia z4 kadlec if it's you 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.750
 I would be pleased if we liked it 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.460
 gives us the thumbs up and if 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.930
 her more nbc news and all 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.610
 possible other stuff then wants to see 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.950
 you look over our channel and 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.950
 pay off or thanks that was matthias
