00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
works out exactly how you would expect

works out exactly how you would expect
it<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.040> work<00:03:14.280> out<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.640> officials<00:03:15.030> don't<00:03:15.209> know

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
it to work out the officials don't know

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.110 
it to work out the officials don't know
what<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.660> do<00:03:15.810> yeah<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:17.190> little<00:03:17.820> bit<00:03:17.970> more

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
what to do yeah so a little bit more

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120 
what to do yeah so a little bit more
nuance<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:19.079> as<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.739> look<00:03:19.769> at<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
nuance on this because as I look at that

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.940 
nuance on this because as I look at that
water<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:21.120> he<00:03:21.930> explains<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.380> as<00:03:22.530> sludgy

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
water it's he explains that as sludgy

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890 
water it's he explains that as sludgy
water<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.340> could<00:03:23.700> result<00:03:24.090> from<00:03:24.269> spills<00:03:24.660> or

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
water that could result from spills or

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.229 
water that could result from spills or
from<00:03:25.440> seeping<00:03:25.799> into<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.130> water<00:03:26.340> table

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
from seeping into the water table

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.599 
from seeping into the water table
so<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:28.049> course<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.829> answer<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> other

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
so of course the answer from the other

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.340 
so of course the answer from the other
side<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.000> gonna<00:03:30.090> be<00:03:30.209> oh<00:03:30.420> don't<00:03:30.720> worry<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.109> not

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
side is gonna be oh don't worry it's not

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.349 
side is gonna be oh don't worry it's not
gonna<00:03:31.530> seep<00:03:31.829> in<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.640> won't<00:03:32.880> be<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.329> that

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
gonna seep in so it won't be like that

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.819 
gonna seep in so it won't be like that
water<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:33.989> that's<00:03:34.049> why<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> don't<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.650> to

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
water so that's why I don't have to

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.430 
water so that's why I don't have to
drink<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.100> water<00:03:35.250> right<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.959> how<00:03:37.139> do<00:03:37.200> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
drink that water right but how do you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.050 
drink that water right but how do you
know<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:38.220> gonna<00:03:38.370> seep<00:03:38.639> in<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.819> that's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
know it's not gonna seep in and that's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.569 
know it's not gonna seep in and that's
the<00:03:39.239> whole<00:03:39.389> point<00:03:39.660> here<00:03:40.319> in<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.040> chainsaws

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the whole point here in the chainsaws

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.699 
the whole point here in the chainsaws
was<00:03:41.819> making<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.180> point<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.569> like<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:43.530> don't

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
was making the point that like you don't

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.720 
was making the point that like you don't
know<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:43.920> not<00:03:43.980> gonna<00:03:44.100> seep<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.609> you're

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
know it's not gonna seep in and you're

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.210 
know it's not gonna seep in and you're
putting<00:03:45.060> into<00:03:45.299> our<00:03:45.420> reservoir<00:03:46.080> right<00:03:46.409> and<00:03:46.680> and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
putting into our reservoir right and and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.699 
putting into our reservoir right and and
it's<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.599> point<00:03:48.840> out<00:03:48.930> ten<00:03:49.230> thousand

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
it's like you point out ten thousand

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.650 
it's like you point out ten thousand
barrels<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:50.040> day<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.340> chemical<00:03:50.940> Laden<00:03:51.120> frack

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
barrels a day of chemical Laden frack

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.810 
barrels a day of chemical Laden frack
in<00:03:51.750> wastewater<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.830> don't<00:03:53.310> want<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.490> anywhere

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
in wastewater I don't want that anywhere

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.240 
in wastewater I don't want that anywhere
near<00:03:54.060> my<00:03:54.240> drinking<00:03:54.660> water<00:03:54.870> right<00:03:55.620> could<00:03:56.130> it

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
near my drinking water right could it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.210 
near my drinking water right could it
seep<00:03:56.490> into<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.850> drinking<00:03:57.330> water<00:03:57.770> could<00:03:58.770> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
seep into the drinking water could and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.280 
seep into the drinking water could and
then<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.030> got<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.240> drink<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.600> or<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.990> got<00:04:01.260> a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
then you got to drink this or I got a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.450 
then you got to drink this or I got a
drink<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.860> don't<00:04:01.920> want<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.250> drink

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
drink this and I don't want to drink

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.580 
drink this and I don't want to drink
this<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:03.180> not<00:04:03.360> as<00:04:03.570> if<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.350> hasn't

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
this and it's not as if that hasn't

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.520 
this and it's not as if that hasn't
happened<00:04:05.100> already<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:06.120> other<00:04:06.510> communities<00:04:07.170> so

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
happened already in other communities so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.400 
happened already in other communities so
it's<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:08.040> legitimate<00:04:08.520> concern<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.240> I<00:04:10.170> think

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
it's a legitimate concern and I think

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.870 
it's a legitimate concern and I think
that<00:04:10.920> when<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.100> comes<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.520> something<00:04:11.760> like

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
that when it comes to something like

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.720 
that when it comes to something like
Frank<00:04:12.300> fracking<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.170> mean<00:04:13.650> we<00:04:13.860> put<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.610> know

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
Frank fracking I mean we put you know

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.270 
Frank fracking I mean we put you know
the<00:04:15.300> cart<00:04:15.600> ahead<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.290> horse<00:04:16.950> is<00:04:17.190> that

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the cart ahead of the the horse is that

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.020 
the cart ahead of the the horse is that
what<00:04:17.430> they<00:04:17.519> say<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:17.880> think<00:04:18.360> so<00:04:19.670> you<00:04:20.670> guys<00:04:20.850> get

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
what they say I think so you guys get

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.009 
what they say I think so you guys get
the<00:04:21.090> point

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
the point

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.200 
the point
there<00:04:22.350> needs<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.860> more<00:04:23.370> research<00:04:23.670> done

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
there needs to be more research done

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.660 
there needs to be more research done
before<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.020> start<00:04:25.470> doing<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.370> completely

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
before you start doing a completely

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.670 
before you start doing a completely
different<00:04:27.000> process<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.570> extracting<00:04:27.960> natural

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
different process of extracting natural

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.920 
different process of extracting natural
gas<00:04:29.160> right<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.030> we<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.510> kind<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.780> like

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
gas right and and we just kind of like

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.930 
gas right and and we just kind of like
take<00:04:31.260> what<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.950> corporation's<00:04:32.520> say<00:04:32.700> at<00:04:32.820> face

value when in reality you could have

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500 
value when in reality you could have
