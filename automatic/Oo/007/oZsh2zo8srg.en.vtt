today<00:04:40.270> are<00:04:40.509> Valencia<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.229> your<00:04:41.379> Ventus<00:04:41.710> and

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
today are Valencia and your Ventus and

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.050 
today are Valencia and your Ventus and
this<00:04:42.190> one<00:04:42.340> actually<00:04:42.400> came<00:04:42.699> to<00:04:42.819> be<00:04:42.940> ever

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
this one actually came to be ever

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.339 
this one actually came to be ever
surprised<00:04:43.419> me<00:04:43.599> so<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.780> thought<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:44.050> lens<00:04:44.229> who

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
surprised me so I thought of lens who

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.869 
surprised me so I thought of lens who
actually<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.800> very<00:04:44.889> bad<00:04:45.129> financial<00:04:45.580> situation

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
actually a very bad financial situation

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.790 
actually a very bad financial situation
but<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:46.930> think<00:04:47.289> they<00:04:47.379> have<00:04:47.409> actually<00:04:47.620> been

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
but I think they have actually been

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.050 
but I think they have actually been
taking<00:04:48.129> over<00:04:48.280> now<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.520> they<00:04:48.610> got<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:48.789> bit<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.030> a

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
taking over now so they got a bit of a

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.450 
taking over now so they got a bit of a
bit<00:04:49.509> of<00:04:49.599> one<00:04:49.810> go<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.110> splash<00:04:50.349> around<00:04:50.379> and<00:04:50.860> with

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
bit of one go to splash around and with

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.460 
bit of one go to splash around and with
Falcao<00:04:51.879> mean<00:04:52.120> Falco<00:04:52.479> would<00:04:52.720> cost<00:04:53.050> an<00:04:53.289> absolute

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
Falcao mean Falco would cost an absolute

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.649 
Falcao mean Falco would cost an absolute
 on<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> 40<00:04:54.639> million<00:04:54.789> pounds<00:04:55.180> around<00:04:55.300> that

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
 on a 40 million pounds around that

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.119 
 on a 40 million pounds around that
