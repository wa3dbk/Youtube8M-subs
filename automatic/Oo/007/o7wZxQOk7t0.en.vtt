to 210 millimeter lens with aperture 1.4
5.6<00:00:49.370> pretty<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:50.640> lens<00:00:50.879> once<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.050> working

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
5.6 pretty good lens once it's working

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
5.6 pretty good lens once it's working
but<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.059> working<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
but when it's not working it's just a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.500 
but when it's not working it's just a
piece<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> junk<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:57.000> work<00:00:57.270> once

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
piece of junk actually it does work once

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
piece of junk actually it does work once
it's<00:00:57.660> connected<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:59.539> camera<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:01.399> guess

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's connected to this camera I guess

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.270 
it's connected to this camera I guess
because<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.409> cropped<00:01:04.409> frame<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.920> whatever

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.539 

it<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.490> goes<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:10.500> aperture<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.130> 4

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it only goes down to an aperture of 4

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
it only goes down to an aperture of 4
and<00:01:12.150> it'll<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.869> aperture<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and it'll go up to an aperture of I

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
and it'll go up to an aperture of I
don't<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> problem

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that I'm having right now is that it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
that I'm having right now is that it

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
let's basically broke see how high this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.339 
let's basically broke see how high this
about<00:03:30.950> takes<00:03:31.639> it<00:03:31.790> sure<00:03:32.500> yeah

now<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.469> tried<00:03:55.469> to<00:03:55.560> figure<00:03:55.829> out<00:03:55.950> what's<00:03:56.249> been

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
now I tried to figure out what's been

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.940 
now I tried to figure out what's been
going<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:57.349> with<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.620> and<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:02.749> see<00:04:03.950> whisper

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the cat here what would be in the

but<00:04:10.049> anyway<00:04:10.409> I'm<00:04:11.010> trying<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> figure<00:04:11.489> out

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
but anyway I'm trying to figure out

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.509 
but anyway I'm trying to figure out
what's<00:04:11.730> been<00:04:11.849> going<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.569> search<00:04:12.900> Google<00:04:13.519> and

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
what's been going on search Google and

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.189 
what's been going on search Google and
found<00:04:14.819> out<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.859> some<00:04:16.859> cheaper<00:04:17.579> lenses<00:04:18.199> won't

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
found out that some cheaper lenses won't

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.999 
found out that some cheaper lenses won't
allow<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:21.259> take<00:04:22.259> pictures<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.680> some<00:04:22.949> of

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
allow you to take pictures with some of

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.600 
allow you to take pictures with some of
the<00:04:23.099> newer<00:04:23.570> cameras<00:04:24.570> like<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.050> 600d<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.340> think

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the newer cameras like the 600d I think

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.520 
the newer cameras like the 600d I think
it's<00:04:26.729> happening<00:04:26.880> with<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> 60d<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.550> 550d

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
it's happening with the 60d and the 550d

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.480 
it's happening with the 60d and the 550d
I<00:04:32.419> was<00:04:33.419> hoping<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.870> there'd<00:04:34.050> be<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.199> better

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
I was hoping that there'd be a better

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.330 
I was hoping that there'd be a better
solution<00:04:35.870> actually<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.229> may<00:04:37.530> still<00:04:37.860> take<00:04:37.889> some

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
solution actually I may still take some

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.189 
solution actually I may still take some
pictures<00:04:38.759> with<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.060> camera<00:04:39.120> because<00:04:39.539> who

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
pictures with this camera because who

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.290 
pictures with this camera because who
cares<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.650> could<00:04:40.800> take<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:40.979> on<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:42.060> I

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
cares I could take it on that that I

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.170 
cares I could take it on that that I
have<00:04:42.990> for<00:04:44.599> aperture<00:04:45.599> for<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.620> got<00:04:46.830> here

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
have for aperture for that I got here

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.850 
have for aperture for that I got here
but<00:04:48.180> I'm<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:49.139> sure<00:04:51.800> that's<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:53.130> for<00:04:53.669> now

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
but I'm not sure that's it for now

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.010 
but I'm not sure that's it for now
I've<00:04:55.860> also<00:04:56.039> got<00:04:56.340> these<00:04:56.520> lenses<00:04:57.090> it's<00:04:57.900> an

or not but I'm pretty sure it's pretty
expensive<00:05:59.729> to<00:05:59.940> fix<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:01.199> not<00:06:01.590> working<00:06:01.949> so<00:06:03.110> take

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
expensive to fix and not working so take

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.139 
expensive to fix and not working so take
care
