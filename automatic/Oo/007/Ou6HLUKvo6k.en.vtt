contains<00:00:14.849> 12<00:00:15.500> immortal<00:00:16.500> items<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
contains 12 immortal items so this is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.460 
contains 12 immortal items so this is
the<00:00:18.170> brewmaster

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the brewmaster

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.060 
the brewmaster
and<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.580> item<00:00:21.050> immortal<00:00:22.050> item<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.410> called<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and the item immortal item is called the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.740 
and the item immortal item is called the
elixir<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.480> dragon's<00:00:24.869> breath<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:26.750> so

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
elixir of the dragon's breath so so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.470 
elixir of the dragon's breath so so
let's<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:28.890> take<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> look<00:00:29.640> about<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.179> atom

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
let's first take a look about this atom

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.900 
let's first take a look about this atom
so<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> front<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.920> looks<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.730> dragon

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
so in the front it looks like a dragon

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.860 
so in the front it looks like a dragon
breathing<00:00:33.840> fire<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> back<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:36.660> tail

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
breathing fire and at the back the tail

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.389 
breathing fire and at the back the tail
itself<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:40.309> scales<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:43.399> in

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
itself we have here this scales so in

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.060 
itself we have here this scales so in
the<00:00:44.730> first<00:00:44.969> scale<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:46.200> changes<00:00:46.770> its

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the first scale it changes its

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.799 
the first scale it changes its
appearance<00:00:49.129> do<00:00:50.390> something<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.800> fiery<00:00:52.800> thing

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
appearance do something like fiery thing

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
appearance do something like fiery thing
and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.140> second<00:00:55.590> skill<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.430> doesn't<00:00:56.699> change

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and the second skill it doesn't change

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.959 
and the second skill it doesn't change
it<00:00:57.530> I'm<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.710> sure<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.760> changes

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it I'm not sure but I think it changes

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.350 
it I'm not sure but I think it changes
color<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> I'm<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.379> sure<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:03.890> ultimate

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
color and I'm not sure in this ultimate

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
color and I'm not sure in this ultimate
ultimate<00:01:06.360> changes<00:01:06.950> there's<00:01:07.950> no<00:01:08.100> change<00:01:08.369> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
ultimate changes there's no change in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
ultimate changes there's no change in
the<00:01:08.549> ultimate<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.240> repeat<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:09.869> no<00:01:10.020> church

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the ultimate I repeat there's no church

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.700 
the ultimate I repeat there's no church
infinitely<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.430> once<00:01:11.640> you've<00:01:11.790> used<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.710> we're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
infinitely so once you've used it we're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
infinitely so once you've used it we're
gonna<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.890> using<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.880> we're<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:15.509> this

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.740 

so<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:24.079> you<00:01:25.079> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:26.689> look<00:01:27.689> at

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
so you can see you can see this look at

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
so you can see you can see this look at
this<00:01:28.670> maybe<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:31.200> primal<00:01:31.560> spit<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this maybe the primal spit so this is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.889 
this maybe the primal spit so this is
how<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.540> changes<00:01:35.090> from<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> first<00:01:36.509> time<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
how it changes from the first time you

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.870 
how it changes from the first time you
use<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.250> brewmaster

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
use it the the brewmaster

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350 
use it the the brewmaster
thunderclap<00:01:39.920> will<00:01:40.920> show<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> fire<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.090> in

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
thunderclap will show you fire but in

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.340 
thunderclap will show you fire but in
this<00:01:42.539> ultimate<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.320> doesn't<00:01:43.590> change<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> only

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
this ultimate it doesn't change it only

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.630 
this ultimate it doesn't change it only
uses<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> default<00:01:46.830> atom

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
uses the default atom

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.779 
uses the default atom
so<00:01:47.850> once<00:01:48.720> you've<00:01:48.869> used<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.549> ultimate<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
so once you've used your ultimate or the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.949 
so once you've used your ultimate or the
primal<00:01:51.179> split<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.679> not<00:01:52.860> change

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
primal split it was it will not change

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.870 
primal split it was it will not change
like<00:01:54.959> this<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.190> think<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.700> for

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
like this so I think that's all for

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.399 
like this so I think that's all for
