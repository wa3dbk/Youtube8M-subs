 for the European Championship 2008 eminence offender hockey advertised thereby the EM in 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.339
 Austria had to be held in southern Burgenland 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.660
 be improved 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.300
 the change convinced and the Burgenland was awarded the contract for the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.660
 in Landscape the OKI European Championships and the facility 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.840
 became one of the most modern in Europe 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.060
 fundamentally changed the tre

 Council with a bar and bow itself parts has been roofed 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.810
 It was installed a camera suitable sports lighting 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.870
 Bohmte what was prescribed by the international federation 1 4 ZPO 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 Rate of the Famous the market 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.870
 put in 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.360
 thus the view that injury-free play is possible 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 and not only the organizer is excited about a facility in Stegersbach 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.450
 also the players from the participating nations feel part of the clip 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.910
 Bolivar 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.430
 Example 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.650
 Roos new regulation 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.740
 as tripled 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.020
 helicopter 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.940
 was so much fun that was so expensive 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.620
 We would like to come back 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.490
 Lion of the young Austrian national team leases 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.490
 although championship x is like a rollercoaster ride 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.939
 after a 6-1 opening victory against Poland and a 6 2 3 1 victory against the 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.169
 Netherlands are the Austrians the strong opponents from Great Britain 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.299
 Switzerland and the brand colleagues 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.700
 but success in qualifying is particularly valuable to Team Austria 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.819
 and he - become 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.049
 against the neighboring Germany 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.359
 We are the only team set Germany are beaten Â»higher 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.279
 Favorite is 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.559
 I say the game alone was advertising for the whole sport and 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.539
 Pure drama 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.149
 The Austrian team just missed the team final 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.979
 In the placement games, the team presents itself at its best 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:52.679
 page 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:56.359
 and finally reaches the country at the European Championships 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.679
 fifth place 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.959
 but not that she is the Team Austria has made 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.439
 For the bankruptcy team, there is a laughing and a crying eye 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.460
 him, of course, the disappointment of that 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.970
 missed semifinal so close to losing the Danes but of course heavy 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.840
 Herzens makes but I say such a great facility is such a great 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.210
 Event a young team it has already fought currencies 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.669
 Communicator affectionate 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.339
 you have to pressure 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:25.709
 and the roles, it is the fifth place of corporate performance of his 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.919
 Teams satisfied 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.989
 Only a lot can be achieved at the European Championships 1994 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.509
 Manageable field with a lot of quality 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:38.489
 but it would be desirable to run more nations of this sport 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.219
 the more action and eStore the more professional the spin on that 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.859
 whole 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.539
 But ethics in action are in the starting blocks 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:50.109
 have a partner school because there is also a federation 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.249
 gives the Czech Association 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.269
 the Russian Federation is in talks of the final nations the next 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.969
 It will be a very young sport but it is happening 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.999
 very much as you can also see the example in Stegersbach 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.299
 and Issac and the next few years surprises are sure to be one 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.299
 European Championship with 16 teams as in football 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.719
 Finally, the teams are on course 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.650
 a Germany Freimark and Switzerland the Confederates come as 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:17.579
 Favorites for the European Championship 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.250
 the defending champions Canada did not tie up to the top performance of the previous year 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.580
 In the end, even a little bit of luck will get you lucky 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.760
 Switzerland loses the semi-final against Great Britain 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.759
 Shootout Spitfire 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.699
 ran in the match for third place against the Swiss against Denmark and also 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.999
 they can not convince in this game 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.099
 the playful quality is enough for a victory against the Danes 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.020
 The Swiss finally win with 5 to 4 GB burst as a consolation 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.089
 finally celebrates as the European champion title 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.800
 regretted and to this day whether on the Loeb 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.449
 the Norwegian 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.680
 Klostermann Platz remains our biggest 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.650
 more third place enough 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.430
 Borst world economy 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.419
 if the oldest picture AFP Berlin and six should be 4 percent 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.189
 Klostermann for the third time the world record 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.449
 Germany kept up in the final 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.710
 Great Britain 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.839
 the Germans seem almost invincible at this European championship 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.589
 in qualifying, they have to take a single defeat and 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.699
 Gas giving Austria and equally strong presented in the final against 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.080
 Finns 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.490
 the Germans dominate the first two-thirds after some mistakes 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.490
 by the way 6 2 0 in front 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.520
 So the German drink remained in the eighth game 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.520
 and the customers can meet three times 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.509
 Finally, but consider it for the Germans they win the final with 6 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.149
 to 3 and are newer in Lenzkirch the OKI European champion 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.469
 Of course very, very difficult 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.709
 in order to say that we now want him really broke and under 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.060
 total shock were explained NASA 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.619
 this is the one for the current year is clear 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.210
 the title win is still no surprise for the Germans if they 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:05.580
 know that they have done for this success 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.099
 Werne eerie community with more than 80 new players 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.199
 4 1 percent 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.229
 Plagiarism too pointedly secret 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.830
 in the connection should 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.430
 Britain, Liz Hurley is her champion behind Germany's Switzerland 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.869
 well
