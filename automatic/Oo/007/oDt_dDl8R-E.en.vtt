00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
of creating a natural looking pair of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.380 
of creating a natural looking pair of
distressed<00:02:17.170> jeans<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.799> they<00:02:18.760> actually<00:02:18.910> look

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
like jeans which have been worn for

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.610 
like jeans which have been worn for
years<00:02:21.700> rather<00:02:22.120> than<00:02:22.330> genes<00:02:22.900> which<00:02:23.140> are<00:02:23.349> brand

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620

fit<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.620> bit<00:03:20.829> looser<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.579> could<00:03:21.819> probably

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
fit a bit looser so you could probably

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420
