one<00:01:52.740> thing<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> cannot<00:01:53.460> fake<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
one thing that you cannot fake is the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.359 
one thing that you cannot fake is the
kernel<00:01:54.720> version<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> did<00:01:55.530> ask<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.250> they

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
kernel version I did ask to see if they

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.740 
kernel version I did ask to see if they
could<00:01:56.399> send<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.969> me<00:01:57.090> where<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> kernels

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
could send that to me where that kernels

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.880 
could send that to me where that kernels
in<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.439> that's<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
in there I don't know if that's going to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.240 
in there I don't know if that's going to
expose<00:01:59.369> them<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.170> source<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.530> no<00:02:02.130> idea

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
expose them as a source I have no idea

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.830 
expose them as a source I have no idea
but<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> that's<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
but I know that's the one thing that you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.630 
but I know that's the one thing that you
can't<00:02:04.140> fake<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.520> if

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
can't fake in here now I don't know if

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.789 
can't fake in here now I don't know if
you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.820> fake<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.060> DPI<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:07.020> faked<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
you can fake the DPI or faked this the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.150 
you can fake the DPI or faked this the
screen<00:02:08.099> resolution<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:10.160> but

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
screen resolution I don't think so but

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.720 
screen resolution I don't think so but
here's<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> other<00:02:11.580> thing<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.050> kind<00:02:13.050> of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
here's the other thing that kind of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.830 
here's the other thing that kind of
brought<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.879> into<00:02:16.030> doubt<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.569> that's<00:02:16.690> why<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
brought it into doubt and that's why I

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.449 
brought it into doubt and that's why I
push<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.230> out<00:02:17.379> with<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> disclaimer<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.310> says

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
push this out with a disclaimer it says

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.750 
push this out with a disclaimer it says

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
little bit longer than the one that I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.300 
little bit longer than the one that I
would<00:02:39.580> find<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> 2014<00:02:40.840> Moto<00:02:41.110> X<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:42.099> could

would find on the 2014 Moto X so could

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.390 
would find on the 2014 Moto X so could
this<00:02:42.400> be<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> development<00:02:43.209> device<00:02:43.680> yes<00:02:44.680> could

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
this be a development device yes could

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
this be a development device yes could
it<00:02:45.489> have<00:02:45.640> been<00:02:45.670> something<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.239> they<00:02:46.330> were

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
it have been something that they were

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.960 
it have been something that they were
developing<00:02:46.660> from<00:02:47.110> last<00:02:47.319> year<00:02:47.620> yes<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.489> don't

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
developing from last year yes I don't

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.430 
developing from last year yes I don't
know<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.209> only<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.630> go<00:02:49.750> by<00:02:49.930> what<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> source

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
know I only can go by what the source

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.319 
know I only can go by what the source
has<00:02:50.680> provided<00:02:51.010> us<00:02:51.280> now<00:02:51.910> there's<00:02:52.090> some<00:02:52.209> other

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
stuff here that they probably didn't

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.229

know was on here some markings and
numbers<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.630> won't<00:02:55.810> put<00:02:55.959> them<00:02:56.079> on<00:02:56.200> blast<00:02:56.440> like

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
numbers I won't put them on blast like

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.110

that but you can see there's some other

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720 
that but you can see there's some other
sensors<00:02:58.569> here<00:02:58.870> if<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.980> guys<00:03:00.010> want<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.400> compare

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
sensors here if you guys want to compare

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.089 
sensors here if you guys want to compare
this<00:03:00.880> with<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.150> Moto<00:03:01.420> X<00:03:01.690> 2014<00:03:02.380> from<00:03:02.590> last<00:03:02.799> year

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
this with the Moto X 2014 from last year

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.910 
this with the Moto X 2014 from last year
and<00:03:03.280> tell<00:03:03.910> me<00:03:04.000> if<00:03:04.090> those<00:03:04.299> sensors<00:03:04.690> lineup<00:03:05.230> then

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
and tell me if those sensors lineup then

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.949 
and tell me if those sensors lineup then
that<00:03:06.099> would<00:03:06.190> be<00:03:06.340> great<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> Moto

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that would be great you can see the Moto

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
but there's the Moto development mark up

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.580 
but there's the Moto development mark up
at<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.549> top<00:03:15.730> but<00:03:16.540> there<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.019> guys<00:03:17.170> I

at the top but there you have it guys I

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.069 
at the top but there you have it guys I
don't<00:03:18.100> know<00:03:18.160> what<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.340> make<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.579> it<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.780> source

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
don't know what to make of it the source

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.400 
don't know what to make of it the source
that<00:03:20.440> has<00:03:20.500> provided<00:03:20.859> this<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.340> me<00:03:21.489> has<00:03:21.670> been

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that has provided this to me has been

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.530 
that has provided this to me has been
exceptionally<00:03:23.410> reliable<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.819> past<00:03:24.910> as

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
exceptionally reliable in the past as

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.690 
exceptionally reliable in the past as
far<00:03:26.319> as<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.739> stuff<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.069> last<00:03:27.370> year<00:03:27.609> at

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
far as you know stuff like last year at

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.509 
far as you know stuff like last year at
the<00:03:27.790> moto<00:03:28.000> luge<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.690> Moto<00:03:28.900> X<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.530> could<00:03:30.489> it

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
the moto luge and the Moto X so could it

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.330 
the moto luge and the Moto X so could it
be<00:03:30.700> legit<00:03:31.060> yes<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.989> personally<00:03:32.920> think<00:03:33.069> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
be legit yes I personally think that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.180 
be legit yes I personally think that
what<00:03:33.639> they've<00:03:33.790> provided<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.389> me<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:35.190> solid

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
what they've provided to me is solid

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.210 
what they've provided to me is solid
could<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.060> be<00:03:37.600> it's<00:03:38.440> possible<00:03:38.980> and

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
could it be it's possible and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.370 
could it be it's possible and
only<00:03:40.150> reason<00:03:40.359> why<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.480> say<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.930> because<00:03:41.049> of

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
only reason why I say that is because of

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.319 
only reason why I say that is because of
the<00:03:41.590> model<00:03:41.920> number<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.280> pulled<00:03:42.489> up<00:03:42.639> in<00:03:42.760> cpu-z

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
the model number that pulled up in cpu-z

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.449 
the model number that pulled up in cpu-z
because<00:03:44.200> we've<00:03:44.380> got<00:03:44.470> some<00:03:44.709> some<00:03:44.920> benchmarks

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
because we've got some some benchmarks

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.090 
because we've got some some benchmarks
and<00:03:45.579> stuff<00:03:45.790> first<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:46.870> was<00:03:46.989> like<00:03:47.049> ah<00:03:47.290> that's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
and stuff first and I was like ah that's

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.559 
and stuff first and I was like ah that's
pretty<00:03:48.400> good<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.209> know<00:03:49.299> in<00:03:49.540> the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
pretty good and you know in the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.750 
pretty good and you know in the
benchmark<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.139> says<00:03:50.410> snapdragon<00:03:51.040> 808<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
benchmark that says snapdragon 808 and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.250 
benchmark that says snapdragon 808 and
all<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.650> nn<00:03:53.650> 22<00:03:54.069> here's<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.090> problem<00:03:55.329> you

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
all of that nn 22 here's the problem you

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.140 
all of that nn 22 here's the problem you
can<00:03:56.410> change<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:57.010> build<00:03:57.220> prop<00:03:57.519> or<00:03:57.730> anything<00:03:58.000> else

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
can change a build prop or anything else

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.940 
can change a build prop or anything else
to<00:03:58.359> make<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.780> device<00:03:59.049> say<00:03:59.319> whatever<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.680> want

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
to make a device say whatever you want

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.370 
to make a device say whatever you want
but<00:04:00.670> anyways<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.569> some<00:04:02.019> of<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.139> things<00:04:02.290> you

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
but anyways to some of the things you

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.199 
but anyways to some of the things you
can't<00:04:02.709> change<00:04:02.799> though<00:04:03.280> are<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.639> processor

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
can't change though are the processor

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.140 
can't change though are the processor
that's<00:04:04.329> on<00:04:04.540> board<00:04:04.840> okay<00:04:05.380> we<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.829> know<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.150> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
that's on board okay we do know that and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.180 
that's on board okay we do know that and
I<00:04:07.359> don't<00:04:07.420> think<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.959> can<00:04:08.079> change<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.950> screen

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
I don't think you can change the screen

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.830 
I don't think you can change the screen
resolution<00:04:09.849> and<00:04:10.060> or<00:04:10.690> screen<00:04:11.049> size<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:12.840> you

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
resolution and or screen size so you

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.469 
resolution and or screen size so you
know<00:04:13.959> we'll<00:04:14.769> find<00:04:14.980> out<00:04:15.220> I've<00:04:15.400> contacted<00:04:16.180> the

know we'll find out I've contacted the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.580 
know we'll find out I've contacted the
source<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.169> ask<00:04:17.530> them<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:18.010> more<00:04:18.570> images

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590

specifically to have that kernel version
