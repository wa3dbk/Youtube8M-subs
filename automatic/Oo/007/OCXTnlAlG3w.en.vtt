00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello youtube you on kichko channel we 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.730
 today i have an amazing for you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.340
 news we finally got the phone 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.380
 which is called iphone 5c 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.300
 true production of China well and in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.420
 principle like the manufacturer itself 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.520
 she is Chinese that is to say this is a copy 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 immediately why took it for what 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.720
 what reasons mean the first reason 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.730
 very many of my friends ask 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 is iphone really chinese 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.320
 origin is very different from 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.510
 the original iphone and what is it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.759
 different if you remember more times 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.160
 probably iphone 4 iphone 4s then 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
 the difference was really great because 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.450
 that the Chinese iPhones first had 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 screen diagonal probably not three with 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.760
 half inch and somewhere two and a half 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 at best, the sides were wide 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 the framework here and well it is clear that the operating 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.510
 the system did not correspond at all 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.940
 there were some java applications and more 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.340
 but time is passing and the Chinese have learned 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 make pretty good copies 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 that's what we decided to figure out 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.190
 there is this the first reason I 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.129
 bought this phone for 2 reasons not 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.049
 I really wanted to see if he really 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.750
 so similar to the original iphone 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.150
 5c or just the Chinese give the wrong 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.020
 Now let's get the information it 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 anboxing 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 and at the same time we will see together what is there 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 she means for this we use here 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.590
 such a miracle knife do not even know where it came from 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.600
 him start this boxing in brief 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.520
 tell the background of my order 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.240
 I ordered it on the site 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 aliexpress for the price of about me too 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.299
 cost about $ 60 that is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.159
 Its price on the site was 67 dollars but with 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.530
 given that I had several 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.720
 coupons when using them he does not 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.790
 cost $ 60 it is even cheaper 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.880
 than philips headphones that we 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.380
 most recently with you opened so i'm 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.649
 Basically I expect to see here. 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 plastic box in my dreams but on 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.570
 in fact, I understand that it is unlikely that I 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.939
 Of course, it means Chinese copy, I hardly 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.009
 I see a plastic box which 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.770
 we saw in the attacks of the last wheelbarrows 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.990
 generations or ipods but pretty 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.800
 not bad there is a box very similar to 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.390
 the one that was used in iphone 5 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.599
 white you see there are no 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.610
 Logos there are no apples 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.900
 there is only the image of the phone itself and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.989
 empty behind 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.380
 let's open this box and 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 look at this long-awaited moment 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.600
 what do we have inside a couple of women and inside 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.910
 we have 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.980
 iphone 5c almost means packed 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.190
 foil I don't know for sure 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.380
 do not spoil the first impressions 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.690
 so let's put off the phone itself and 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.530
 let's see what does it mean here 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.690
 cradle 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.180
 here is such a one that looks more like 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.940
 probably on the holder for soap because 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.080
 what on well too deep so and 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.299
 let's still watch here so we 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.340
 there is such a bag that we do not need 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.609
 she is pretty much here 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.950
 we are looking at an interesting cord 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.489
 very similar to tell you on the lightning 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.440
 connector 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.140
 this will remove her che further we will do 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.489
 detailed review and here if barter 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.100
 bear but it is very similar to the original 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.590
 lightning connector and we will check the signal 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.350
 it works with apple devices either 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.310
 it's just some kind of microusb 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.840
 we postpone we go further so on with us 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.950
 I have headphones 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.019
 Headphones are very cheap plastic and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.389
 similar to the old generations that 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.150
 were used here in iphone 4s fours 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.500
 in 3ds there’s probably a terrible sound 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.450
 tell you right away though they don’t 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.670
 used but about such already 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.670
 once i had so an adapter under 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.150
 our sockets and the power supply itself which 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.609
 Well 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.610
 accuracy corresponds to what we 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.640
 seen at apple mean 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.410
 you see that 5 volts 1 1 amps 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.300
 the principle of the characteristics is the same 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.090
 and we also have instructions here 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.690
 operating mean a mobile menu as they 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.320
 speak here it is in English and on 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.540
 English language 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.190
 so now we have to start 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.260
 probably to review this device 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.600
 To be honest, I'm already afraid of him. 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.880
 open don't know how to open it 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.420
 seems like some kind of ankle thrust thuja 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.310
 it is not clear that if I say it 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.540
 do n't even know where to start it 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.010
 unpacking if you take a knife I'm afraid that 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.770
 no good with this is not the floor 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.610
 all the same will try to learn it 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.130
 tear it off 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.190
 hands like this whole thing like 2 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.340
 my wife is cooking chicken or something else 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.820
 clearly sealing it in this 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.530
 foil then puts in the oven by the way 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.600
 if interested in the future I can 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.300
 disassemble this phone and see what 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.400
 same filled Chinese copy from the inside 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.960
 if you are interested please write to 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.240
 comments that you would like to see 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.500
 what's inside this phone and we 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.200
 surely his 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.150
 I will also reveal that I will show with 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.580
 With this phone for several weeks it is possible 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.669
 week two three and then do a detailed 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.400
 review this phone significantly and so here 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.890
 he is not the first thing that rushes to 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.500
 eyes and there are very different inscriptions 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.960
 mean the device itself is well 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.410
 not bad buttons are pressed there is even 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.180
 so I understand no, it does not work or 5 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.090
 oil if he and work it is very difficult 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.979
 because I did not succeed at last 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.380
 managed to move the regulators 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.130
 silent mode Kate father would say 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:46.290
 it was not easy to do that I see sleep right away 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:48.450
 I see the home button I see the front 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.520
 camera and see the back camera and 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.360
 LED flash on this side 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.689
 we have equal top code 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.340
 micro-sim that's the principle in brief about it 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.280
 device let's try and every 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.689
 If you turn it on for now, including I will say 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.090
 I ordered that I said it on 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.560
 aliexpress and and this phone walked like a stone 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.960
 a little less than a month, somewhere three 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.789
 half a week first he was sent 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.770
 by China post but he came back 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.520
 because of some problems with the battery and 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.159
 then again he came to live through 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.780
 another service in my Swedish post and 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.460
 me-che of it as I have already said, 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.560
 three and a half weeks we loaded 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:29.020
 We see the inscription android screen did not promise 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.180
 960 by 540 I do not know how much the truth is 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.560
 well, very similar I would say first 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:38.529
 impressions on the iphone 5 0 5 se 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.120
 and on firmware ios 7 and so leave for 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.099
 yourself two or three weeks to 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.960
 look at this phone like him 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.969
 it works that it is interesting and 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.849
 will definitely come back to you with full 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:51.550
 overview of the device itself and its full 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.870
 compared with the original iphone all 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.099
 Thank you for watching channel 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.710
