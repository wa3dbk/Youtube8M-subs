00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:12.240
 hi chip band here is my project of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.380
 Saturday a bicycle and cyclotron carrier and 24 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 and all we want there are two 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.619
 wheels on hitch but something good 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.080
 solid blow to be able to wear 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.380
 things very much heavy as my people 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:32.399
 so that's how I make them and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.540
 already I bought an intimate finally a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.220
 trailer hitch head 18 euros 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.000
 I took the biggest model I have 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.750
 found at an affordable price of topics 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 under two steel plates 200 mm 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.140
 wide by 5 mm thick and its 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.750
 steel plates 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.910
 there is one on each side so hop 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.219
 this is the idea now below 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 certainly to guide the cnas for not that they 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.439
 move sideways in all three 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.420
 Sundays 3 direction that is to say as 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.939
 these here like this is of course like 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.369
 this finally brief all directions he 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.399
 there is a third one that I forgot 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.619
 but well short I was smart but he 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.329
 there is one of the directions where I had trouble 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.649
 then to regulate precisely the 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.209
 position of the bike carrier well two 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.789
 settings on each side that serve to 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:36.329
 ceret the stem of the taz is below 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:40.079
 on the side here is a screw that is used to 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.039
 adjust the horizontal position of the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.259
 system finally from above is not mounted 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.369
 then I'll get it and a screw that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.929
 put in this hole there that comes from life 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.819
 it's on the other side that avoids 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.409
 when one brakes the system switches in 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.779
 the other way and who challenge each other 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.020
 I'll get it and show it 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.020
 after 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.619
 here is the screw with a small spring 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:14.920
 for package splits itself on the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:18.680
 road toc 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.860
 so he knows well over the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.250
 stem and avoids tipping we count there 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.420
 have weight 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.880
 you really have to take care of that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.860
 rocking behind a plate 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.510
 registration 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.840
 a little reinforcement to prevent the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.590
 plate 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.239
 if when we disassemble breaks and so the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.440
 bike rack system comes from a 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.660
 bike rack that put Norman on 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.410
 roof bars 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.380
 so with both rails and the system 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.239
 home here I just disassemble 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.600
 middle to put a piece of each 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.890
 side of the beach there is no need to 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.250
 headlights because we see very well the cra 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.269
 of the car very well behind there 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.269
 has no plate lighting but 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:05.690
 frankly it'll be fine but here it is 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.959
 sure reinforcements here we see who 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.760
 possible to prevent the weight face 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.220
 bend the bar to the bar that is under 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.170
 the breath hitch of soues during the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.620
 bike carrier here is almost 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.360
 the recovery 1 except the lathing that you have the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.959
 headstock that I had not all there 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.140
 I already had it where it is 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.790
 that's it and it's very good 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.180
 I will try any fashion fan to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.650
 solidity for solidity 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.650
 I weigh about 90 kg 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:59.460
 no problem and for the dismantling of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:04:05.770
 vis Ã  vis security and that's what weighs 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.450
 a big ten kilos that's with 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.010
 the cyclotron 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.520
 so we can see why I shifted 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.200
 at the maximum towards this side 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.860
 it is so that the saw with 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.390
 not too many spaces here is the canton 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.170
 but that a bike necessarily goes beyond 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.000
 this side there of the other 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.850
 but when we put the cyclotron we are 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.010
 well happy then in this case on 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.610
 my car I have a removable hitch 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.130
 who are declining pts and who has a little bit of 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.060
 game that partly explains the game when 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.240
 when we go up the system is so here is 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.970
 here we see better the two plates 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.720
 the four settings so two for this 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.770
 axis also and two for this axis here and here 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.210
 verticality in the other direction 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.620
 so that must fit on a lot of 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.830
 taste of the alger no other cars to 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.520
 4h to test and its dirt pretty much 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.520
 everywhere go to more
