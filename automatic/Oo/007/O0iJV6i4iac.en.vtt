00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
talking about songs like the will

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.460 
talking about songs like the will
stirred<00:01:05.120> will<00:01:05.239> be<00:01:05.330> unbroken<00:01:05.510> I<00:01:05.900> saw<00:01:06.170> life

sitting<00:01:07.010> on<00:01:07.130> top<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.490> world<00:01:07.640> things<00:01:07.970> like

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
sitting on top of the world things like

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.910 
sitting on top of the world things like
that<00:01:08.299> I<00:01:08.330> think<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.600> people<00:01:08.960> sing<00:01:09.259> at<00:01:09.470> jams<00:01:09.680> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
that I think that people sing at jams a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.200 
that I think that people sing at jams a
lot<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:11.210> what<00:01:11.479> do<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:11.630> do<00:01:11.840> on<00:01:12.110> banjo<00:01:13.210> when

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
lot and what do you do on banjo when

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.249 
lot and what do you do on banjo when
they're<00:01:14.390> singing<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.810> wonder<00:01:15.080> not<00:01:15.200> sing<00:01:17.259> so

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
they're singing and wonder not sing so

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.499 
they're singing and wonder not sing so
today<00:01:18.740> we'll<00:01:19.070> probably<00:01:19.250> start<00:01:19.729> off<00:01:20.060> with<00:01:20.479> a

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
today we'll probably start off with a

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.940 
today we'll probably start off with a
very<00:01:20.720> basic<00:01:21.229> look<00:01:22.070> at<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.400> song<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.650> don't

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
very basic look at a song that I don't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.890
