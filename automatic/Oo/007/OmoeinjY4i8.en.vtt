historical fight that's been talked

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.870 
historical fight that's been talked
about<00:02:56.230> argued<00:02:57.230> about<00:02:57.470> 10<00:02:58.130> years<00:02:58.310> i<00:02:58.549> think<00:02:58.610> it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
about argued about 10 years i think it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.610 
about argued about 10 years i think it
would<00:02:58.970> be<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> great<00:02:59.329> thing<00:02:59.360> other<00:03:00.319> than<00:03:00.349> that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
would be a great thing other than that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.680 
would be a great thing other than that
then<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.579> probably<00:03:01.790> ruin<00:03:02.180> another<00:03:02.269> young

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
then then I probably ruin another young

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.610 
then then I probably ruin another young
career<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.349> young<00:03:04.099> for<00:03:04.310> coming<00:03:04.700> fighter
