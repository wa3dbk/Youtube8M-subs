00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:05.860 
so on the screen here you can see that

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.860 
so on the screen here you can see that
we're<00:00:06.010> in<00:00:06.130> manual<00:00:06.490> exposure<00:00:06.820> you'll<00:00:07.660> see

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
we're in manual exposure you'll see

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.740 
we're in manual exposure you'll see
we're<00:00:08.020> ISO<00:00:08.440> 1250<00:00:09.250> we<00:00:09.940> have<00:00:10.059> auto<00:00:10.330> white

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
we're ISO 1250 we have auto white

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.619 
we're ISO 1250 we have auto white
balance<00:00:10.780> set<00:00:11.440> f5<00:00:12.369> and<00:00:12.700> one<00:00:12.910> sixtieth<00:00:13.389> of<00:00:13.510> a

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
balance set f5 and one sixtieth of a

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.049 
balance set f5 and one sixtieth of a
second<00:00:14.020> put<00:00:14.889> a<00:00:14.920> little<00:00:15.160> battery<00:00:15.520> sensor<00:00:15.879> here

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
second put a little battery sensor here

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.670 
second put a little battery sensor here
which<00:00:16.240> tells<00:00:16.449> us<00:00:16.660> both<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.199> battery<00:00:17.530> of<00:00:17.650> the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
which tells us both the battery of the

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.620 
which tells us both the battery of the
camera<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.670> battery<00:00:18.820> power<00:00:19.210> of<00:00:19.390> the

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
camera and the battery power of the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.499 
camera and the battery power of the
remote<00:00:19.900> itself<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.310> let's<00:00:22.119> go<00:00:22.269> ahead<00:00:22.359> and

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
remote itself so let's go ahead and

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.210 
remote itself so let's go ahead and
change<00:00:22.869> some<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.080> these<00:00:23.199> settings<00:00:23.259> if<00:00:23.740> I<00:00:23.830> click

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
change some of these settings if I click

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.550 
change some of these settings if I click
the<00:00:25.089> selection<00:00:25.480> button<00:00:25.929> on<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.140> bottom<00:00:26.380> here

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
the selection button on the bottom here

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.109 
the selection button on the bottom here
you'll<00:00:26.740> see<00:00:26.919> that<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.160> ISO<00:00:27.580> is<00:00:27.730> starting<00:00:28.060> to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
you'll see that the ISO is starting to

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.200 
you'll see that the ISO is starting to
flash<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.689> can<00:00:29.349> roll<00:00:29.529> this<00:00:29.740> up<00:00:30.009> and<00:00:30.699> down<00:00:30.939> and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
flash I can roll this up and down and

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.170 
flash I can roll this up and down and
you'll<00:00:31.660> see<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:33.130> exposure<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.700> changing

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
you'll see that the exposure is changing

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.590 
you'll see that the exposure is changing
on<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.390> back<00:00:34.960> of<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.230> camera<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.030> let's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
on the back of the camera so let's

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.980 
on the back of the camera so let's
select<00:00:37.840> which<00:00:38.410> one<00:00:38.590> we<00:00:38.740> want<00:00:39.030> ISO<00:00:40.030> 1250<00:00:40.690> just

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
select which one we want ISO 1250 just

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.380 
select which one we want ISO 1250 just
by<00:00:41.110> clicking<00:00:41.290> in<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:42.610> if<00:00:42.790> we<00:00:42.910> wanted<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:43.240> do

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
by clicking in now if we wanted to do

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.030 
by clicking in now if we wanted to do
some<00:00:43.570> different<00:00:43.900> settings<00:00:44.200> we<00:00:44.380> click<00:00:44.650> again

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
some different settings we click again

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.950 
some different settings we click again
on<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.490> bottom<00:00:45.640> there<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.120> then<00:00:46.210> we<00:00:46.930> can

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
on the bottom there and then we can

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.080 
on the bottom there and then we can
basically<00:00:47.200> cycle<00:00:48.010> through<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.730> different

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
basically cycle through the different

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.390 
basically cycle through the different
settings<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:49.630> is<00:00:49.690> focus<00:00:50.290> mode<00:00:50.500> setting<00:00:50.920> and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
settings this is focus mode setting and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.150 
settings this is focus mode setting and
we<00:00:51.520> have<00:00:51.640> three<00:00:51.880> different<00:00:51.910> focus<00:00:52.510> speeds<00:00:52.810> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we have three different focus speeds and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270 
we have three different focus speeds and
a<00:00:54.160> progressive<00:00:54.760> focus<00:00:55.360> mode<00:00:55.570> so<00:00:56.320> this<00:00:57.130> is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
a progressive focus mode so this is

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.730 
a progressive focus mode so this is
saying<00:00:57.520> focus<00:00:57.790> 3p<00:00:59.490> and<00:01:00.490> then<00:01:00.640> we<00:01:00.700> got<00:01:00.850> focus<00:01:01.270> 1

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
saying focus 3p and then we got focus 1

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.969 
saying focus 3p and then we got focus 1
focus<00:01:02.740> 2<00:01:03.010> which<00:01:03.670> has<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:03.910> progressive<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.350> a

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
focus 2 which has a progressive and a

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.110 
focus 2 which has a progressive and a
single<00:01:06.730> speed<00:01:06.940> focus<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.660> then<00:01:08.470> go<00:01:09.160> to<00:01:09.220> focus

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
single speed focus and then go to focus

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.180 
single speed focus and then go to focus
3<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.050> basically<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.770> difference<00:01:12.070> between

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
3 so basically the difference between

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.170 
3 so basically the difference between
those<00:01:12.520> is<00:01:12.990> focus<00:01:13.990> 1<00:01:14.230> 2<00:01:14.470> &amp;<00:01:14.650> 3<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.370> F<00:01:15.550> mode<00:01:15.940> is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
those is focus 1 2 &amp; 3 in the F mode is

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.600 
those is focus 1 2 &amp; 3 in the F mode is
just<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.630> set<00:01:16.930> speed<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:17.710> if<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.220> were<00:01:18.460> to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
just a set speed so if you were to

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.180 
just a set speed so if you were to
select<00:01:18.790> F<00:01:19.150> mode<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.020> just<00:01:20.230> went<00:01:20.590> left<00:01:20.860> or

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
select F mode and you just went left or

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.399 
select F mode and you just went left or
right<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:22.300> doesn't<00:01:22.510> matter<00:01:22.630> where<00:01:23.080> in<00:01:23.290> this

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
right it doesn't matter where in this

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.680 
right it doesn't matter where in this
positioning<00:01:24.040> you<00:01:24.159> go<00:01:24.430> it's<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.000> same<00:01:25.270> speed

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
positioning you go it's the same speed

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.830 
positioning you go it's the same speed
focusing<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.440> either<00:01:26.620> direction<00:01:26.940> now<00:01:27.940> say<00:01:28.690> we

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
focusing in either direction now say we

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.070 
focusing in either direction now say we
wanted<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.370> have<00:01:30.370> it<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.730> P<00:01:31.180> mode<00:01:31.510> we're<00:01:31.990> in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
wanted to have it in P mode we're in

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.520 
wanted to have it in P mode we're in
focus<00:01:32.500> 3<00:01:32.830> P<00:01:33.550> now<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.150> select<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.720> one<00:01:34.900> what

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
focus 3 P now and select that one what

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.040 
focus 3 P now and select that one what
this<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:36.030> basically<00:01:37.030> makes<00:01:37.240> use<00:01:37.510> of<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.780> three

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
this is basically makes use of the three

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.649 
this is basically makes use of the three
different<00:01:38.229> speeds<00:01:38.440> available<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.580> does<00:01:40.479> them

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
different speeds available and does them

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.660 
different speeds available and does them
across<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.170> range<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.800> either<00:01:42.010> direction<00:01:42.220> so

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
across the range in either direction so

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.070 
across the range in either direction so
here<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.300> would<00:01:43.420> have<00:01:43.479> slow<00:01:44.140> medium<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.549> fast

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
here we would have slow medium and fast

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.300 
here we would have slow medium and fast
so<00:01:47.080> that's<00:01:47.200> what<00:01:47.409> progressive<00:01:47.860> means<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.159> get

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
so that's what progressive means you get

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.190 
so that's what progressive means you get
three<00:01:48.549> different<00:01:48.850> speeds<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.420> each<00:01:49.960> direction

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
three different speeds in each direction

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.560 
three different speeds in each direction
throughout<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.159> travel<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.790> focus<00:01:52.180> throw

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
throughout the travel of the focus throw

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.020 
throughout the travel of the focus throw
switch<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.280> going<00:01:54.820> back<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.150> here<00:01:55.390> again<00:01:55.950> focus

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
switch so going back in here again focus

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.609 
switch so going back in here again focus
here<00:01:58.030> we<00:01:58.150> can<00:01:58.330> set<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> shutter<00:01:58.930> speed<00:01:59.440> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
here we can set the shutter speed and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.039 
here we can set the shutter speed and
here<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.860> set<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.700> white<00:02:04.360> balance<00:02:04.390> we<00:02:04.930> can

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
here we can set the white balance we can

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.960 
here we can set the white balance we can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
either have auto white balance or we can

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.660 
either have auto white balance or we can
select<00:02:07.150> Kelvin<00:02:08.049> temperature<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:12.489> we

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
select Kelvin temperature and here we

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.530 
select Kelvin temperature and here we
have<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.629> aperture

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.819 
direction so we just come and bring this
into<00:03:15.239> focus<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.079> where<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.349> are<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:19.680> can

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
sure you're right in focus pop back out

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.659 
sure you're right in focus pop back out
to<00:03:27.900> 100%<00:03:29.540> now<00:03:30.709> this<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.829> actually<00:03:31.979> a<00:03:32.400> bit

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
to 100% now this is actually a bit

to 100% now this is actually a bit
overexposed<00:03:33.150> over<00:03:33.690> me<00:03:33.840> turn<00:03:34.409> that<00:03:34.560> down<00:03:36.889> so

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
overexposed over me turn that down so

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.409 
overexposed over me turn that down so
that<00:03:37.919> pretty<00:03:38.519> much<00:03:38.639> works<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.299> does

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.690 
it definitely doesn't work like a
regular<00:04:16.750> remote<00:04:17.290> would<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.220> that's<00:04:18.370> plugged

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
regular remote would do that's plugged

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.550 
regular remote would do that's plugged
inside<00:04:18.880> there<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.630> actually<00:04:20.410> that's

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
inside there and actually that's

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.380 
inside there and actually that's
something<00:04:20.650> else<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:21.040> point<00:04:21.220> now<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:21.820> if

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
something else to point now because if

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.430 
something else to point now because if
the<00:04:22.570> camera<00:04:22.870> goes<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.230> sleep<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:25.260> wonder<00:04:26.260> if<00:04:26.350> I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
the camera goes to sleep I wonder if I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.690 
the camera goes to sleep I wonder if I
can<00:04:26.500> put<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:27.100> sleep<00:04:29.400> not<00:04:30.400> going<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> be

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
can put this to sleep not going to be

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.100 
can put this to sleep not going to be
able<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.910> show<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.210> actually<00:04:31.600> for<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.870> few

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
able to show this actually for a few

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.030 
able to show this actually for a few
minutes<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.470> let<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.740> go

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
minutes to let that go

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.250 
minutes to let that go
essentially<00:04:33.880> if<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:33.970> camera<00:04:34.300> goes<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.660> sleep

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
essentially if the camera goes to sleep

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.180 
essentially if the camera goes to sleep
none<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.710> these<00:04:35.980> buttons<00:04:36.490> wake<00:04:36.880> it<00:04:37.060> up<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.830> if

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
none of these buttons wake it up so if

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.990 
none of these buttons wake it up so if
you<00:04:39.250> have<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.880> thing<00:04:39.940> up<00:04:40.419> on<00:04:41.730> taking<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.790> photo

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
you have this thing up on taking a photo

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.930 
you have this thing up on taking a photo
if<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:43.930> have<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.169> thing<00:04:44.230> up<00:04:44.530> on<00:04:44.740> some<00:04:45.730> kind

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
if you have this thing up on some kind

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.430 
if you have this thing up on some kind
of<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.090> rig<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.720> reason<00:04:47.020> you're<00:04:47.080> using<00:04:47.350> the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
of a rig and the reason you're using the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.480 
of a rig and the reason you're using the
remote<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.860> because<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.160> don't<00:04:48.310> want<00:04:48.430> to

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
remote is because you don't want to

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.040 
remote is because you don't want to
touch<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.820> camera<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.390> then<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.960> camera

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
touch the camera and then the camera

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.860 
touch the camera and then the camera
goes<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.620> sleep<00:04:50.770> well<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:52.360> would<00:04:52.510> think<00:04:52.690> that

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
goes to sleep well you would think that

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.409 
goes to sleep well you would think that
doing<00:04:53.680> something<00:04:53.950> here<00:04:54.760> with<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.120> remote

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
doing something here with the remote

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.850 
doing something here with the remote
would<00:04:55.630> wake<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.900> up<00:04:55.990> but<00:04:56.200> unfortunately<00:04:56.320> it

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
would wake it up but unfortunately it

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.070 
would wake it up but unfortunately it
doesn't<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.430> that's<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:58.060> pretty<00:04:58.390> big<00:04:58.570> drawback

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
doesn't and that's a pretty big drawback

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.530 
doesn't and that's a pretty big drawback
really<00:04:59.440> for<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.220> type<00:05:00.430> of<00:05:00.460> uses<00:05:00.910> that<00:05:00.940> I<00:05:01.300> would

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
really for the type of uses that I would

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.500 
really for the type of uses that I would
see<00:05:01.750> people<00:05:01.950> using<00:05:02.950> this<00:05:03.160> form<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:04.240> that's

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
see people using this form so that's

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.409 
see people using this form so that's
yeah<00:05:04.690> definitely<00:05:05.200> something<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:06.220> note<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:10.360> you

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
yeah definitely something to note so you

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.670 
yeah definitely something to note so you
should<00:05:10.570> be<00:05:10.660> able<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:10.900> see<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.110> little<00:05:11.320> focus

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
should be able to see the little focus

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.380 
should be able to see the little focus
dial<00:05:11.919> there<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:12.669> now<00:05:12.850> I'm<00:05:12.940> going<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.120> put<00:05:13.300> this

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
dial there and now I'm going to put this

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.330 
dial there and now I'm going to put this
in<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.780> fastest<00:05:14.320> focusing<00:05:16.979> you<00:05:17.979> see<00:05:18.190> that

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
in the fastest focusing you see that

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.370 
in the fastest focusing you see that
moving<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.650> just<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:20.950> show<00:05:21.130> you<00:05:22.169> it's<00:05:23.169> still

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
moving and just to show you it's still

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.990 
moving and just to show you it's still
going<00:05:23.770> but<00:05:24.700> I<00:05:24.970> mean<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.430> scale<00:05:27.760> that

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
going but I mean this is the scale that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.640 
going but I mean this is the scale that
we're<00:05:28.570> talking<00:05:28.690> about<00:05:28.930> here<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:31.570> yet<00:05:31.810> here<00:05:34.650> is

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
we're talking about here and yet here is

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.920 
we're talking about here and yet here is
the<00:05:35.710> fastest<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.729> it<00:05:37.210> can<00:05:37.390> get<00:05:37.540> this<00:05:37.720> lens

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
the fastest that it can get this lens

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.260 
the fastest that it can get this lens
focusing<00:05:38.500> using<00:05:38.800> this<00:05:38.890> remote<00:05:39.180> so<00:05:40.180> you

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
focusing using this remote so you

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.640 
focusing using this remote so you
definitely<00:05:40.390> can't<00:05:40.810> really<00:05:41.020> track<00:05:41.320> anything

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
definitely can't really track anything

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.350 
definitely can't really track anything
with<00:05:41.979> it<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:45.310> of<00:05:45.370> course<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.700> feature<00:05:45.880> that<00:05:46.180> a

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
with it so of course the feature that a

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.550 
with it so of course the feature that a
lot<00:05:46.660> of<00:05:46.750> people<00:05:46.930> are<00:05:47.020> going<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.169> want<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.410> use

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
lot of people are going to want to use

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.690 
lot of people are going to want to use
this<00:05:47.710> for<00:05:48.039> is<00:05:48.310> remote<00:05:49.090> focusing<00:05:50.370> having<00:05:51.370> a<00:05:51.430> rig

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
this for is remote focusing having a rig

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.640 
this for is remote focusing having a rig
without<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:52.060> traditional<00:05:52.600> follow<00:05:53.140> focus<00:05:53.530> on

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
without a traditional follow focus on

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.400 
without a traditional follow focus on
the<00:05:53.740> side<00:05:54.150> seems<00:05:55.150> like<00:05:55.479> a<00:05:55.510> really<00:05:55.840> nice<00:05:55.960> idea

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
the side seems like a really nice idea

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.880 
the side seems like a really nice idea
and<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:57.280> want<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.550> demonstrate<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.830> how<00:05:59.830> the

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
and I want to demonstrate to you how the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.250 
and I want to demonstrate to you how the
focusing<00:06:00.490> works<00:06:00.760> because<00:06:01.210> it's<00:06:02.050> definitely

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
focusing works because it's definitely

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.630 
focusing works because it's definitely
worth<00:06:02.620> knowing<00:06:02.890> a<00:06:02.979> little<00:06:03.070> bit<00:06:03.190> more<00:06:03.460> about

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
worth knowing a little bit more about

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.680 
worth knowing a little bit more about
this<00:06:04.320> one<00:06:05.320> thing<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.650> I've<00:06:05.740> seen<00:06:06.070> is<00:06:06.340> that

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
this one thing that I've seen is that

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.260 
this one thing that I've seen is that
there<00:06:07.690> is<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:07.930> huge<00:06:08.410> difference<00:06:08.919> in<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.820> speed

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
there is a huge difference in the speed

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.060 
there is a huge difference in the speed
and<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.660> manner<00:06:10.930> at<00:06:11.260> which<00:06:11.440> focusing<00:06:11.979> is

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
and the manner at which focusing is

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.089 
and the manner at which focusing is
achieved<00:06:12.430> with<00:06:12.610> different<00:06:12.970> lenses<00:06:13.260> so<00:06:14.260> if<00:06:14.950> you

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
achieved with different lenses so if you

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.990 
achieved with different lenses so if you
are<00:06:15.160> contemplating<00:06:15.700> buying<00:06:16.150> one<00:06:16.360> of<00:06:16.390> these<00:06:16.630> I

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
are contemplating buying one of these I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.690 
are contemplating buying one of these I
really<00:06:19.000> would<00:06:19.300> recommend<00:06:19.599> trying<00:06:20.590> to<00:06:20.860> play

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
really would recommend trying to play

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.190 
really would recommend trying to play
with<00:06:21.880> one<00:06:22.000> in<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.210> store<00:06:22.479> with<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.810> lenses<00:06:23.169> that

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
with one in a store with the lenses that

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.469 
with one in a store with the lenses that
you<00:06:23.349> intend<00:06:23.740> on<00:06:23.830> using<00:06:23.890> it<00:06:24.280> with<00:06:24.400> so<00:06:25.030> at<00:06:25.330> the

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
you intend on using it with so at the

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.050 
you intend on using it with so at the
moment<00:06:25.840> we're<00:06:26.410> in<00:06:26.440> focus<00:06:26.950> on<00:06:27.070> this<00:06:27.190> this<00:06:27.789> plan

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
moment we're in focus on this this plan

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.560 
moment we're in focus on this this plan
right<00:06:28.270> here<00:06:28.510> now<00:06:29.169> if<00:06:29.440> I<00:06:29.740> throw<00:06:30.039> this

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
right here now if I throw this

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.760 
right here now if I throw this
completely<00:06:31.570> out<00:06:31.690> of<00:06:31.720> focus<00:06:31.990> until<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.590> lens

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
completely out of focus until the lens

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.700 
completely out of focus until the lens
goes<00:06:33.640> to<00:06:33.849> its<00:06:34.000> extremity<00:06:34.630> which<00:06:35.349> I'm<00:06:35.560> doing

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
goes to its extremity which I'm doing

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.159 
goes to its extremity which I'm doing
there<00:06:36.039> we<00:06:36.099> go<00:06:36.250> just<00:06:36.580> stop<00:06:36.789> press<00:06:37.060> now<00:06:37.270> now

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
there we go just stop press now now

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:44.399 
there we go just stop press now now
let's<00:06:38.380> just<00:06:38.530> go<00:06:38.680> back<00:06:38.890> into<00:06:39.070> focus<00:06:39.460> again<00:06:43.409> and

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
let's just go back into focus again and

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.960 
let's just go back into focus again and
we're<00:06:45.250> in<00:06:45.340> focus<00:06:45.729> right<00:06:45.909> there<00:06:47.729> go<00:06:48.729> the<00:06:48.849> other

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
we're in focus right there go the other

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.070 
we're in focus right there go the other
way<00:06:49.060> to<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.450> other<00:06:49.570> extreme

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.719 

yeah<00:06:53.080> I'm<00:06:53.169> not<00:06:53.380> actually<00:06:53.860> even<00:06:54.370> going<00:06:54.669> to

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:54.729 
yeah I'm not actually even going to

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:55.740 
yeah I'm not actually even going to
bother<00:06:54.820> doing<00:06:55.060> that<00:06:55.210> it's<00:06:55.419> going<00:06:55.539> to<00:06:55.599> take

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
bother doing that it's going to take

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.529 
bother doing that it's going to take
forever<00:06:55.900> so<00:06:56.460> this<00:06:57.460> particular<00:06:57.820> lens<00:06:58.240> is

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
forever so this particular lens is

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:03.420 
forever so this particular lens is
extremely<00:06:59.530> slow<00:07:00.330> at<00:07:01.330> focusing<00:07:01.990> but<00:07:02.800> it<00:07:03.190> does

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
extremely slow at focusing but it does

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.000 
extremely slow at focusing but it does
it<00:07:03.550> quite<00:07:03.729> smoothly<00:07:04.060> now<00:07:04.840> these<00:07:05.020> designs<00:07:05.440> for

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
it quite smoothly now these designs for

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.830 
it quite smoothly now these designs for
these<00:07:06.130> lenses<00:07:06.520> they<00:07:06.669> were<00:07:07.000> never<00:07:07.180> intended<00:07:07.390> to

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
these lenses they were never intended to

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.649 
these lenses they were never intended to
have<00:07:08.200> continuous<00:07:08.830> focusing<00:07:09.340> video<00:07:09.640> shown<00:07:10.450> on

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:10.659 
have continuous focusing video shown on

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.399 
have continuous focusing video shown on
them<00:07:10.810> so<00:07:11.550> it's<00:07:12.550> a<00:07:12.700> little<00:07:12.849> bit<00:07:13.060> jerky<00:07:13.419> as<00:07:13.870> it

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409 
them so it's a little bit jerky as it

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.980 
them so it's a little bit jerky as it
moves<00:07:14.620> through<00:07:14.919> the<00:07:15.180> focusing<00:07:16.180> cycle<00:07:16.570> but

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
moves through the focusing cycle but

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.260 
moves through the focusing cycle but
this<00:07:17.140> one<00:07:17.320> actually<00:07:17.530> isn't<00:07:17.919> so<00:07:18.130> I<00:07:18.610> don't<00:07:19.060> know

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
this one actually isn't so I don't know

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.149 
this one actually isn't so I don't know
like<00:07:19.870> I<00:07:19.900> said<00:07:20.140> it<00:07:20.260> every<00:07:20.680> lens<00:07:20.890> that<00:07:21.070> I've

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159 
like I said it every lens that I've

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:22.140 
like I said it every lens that I've
tried<00:07:21.430> has<00:07:21.550> been<00:07:21.700> a<00:07:21.729> little<00:07:21.909> bit

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
tried has been a little bit

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.670 
tried has been a little bit
from<00:07:22.300> this<00:07:22.420> one's<00:07:22.600> really<00:07:22.810> smooth<00:07:23.230> but<00:07:23.560> it's

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 
from this one's really smooth but it's

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.550 
from this one's really smooth but it's
really<00:07:23.860> slow<00:07:24.250> I<00:07:24.490> put<00:07:25.090> the<00:07:25.180> 24<00:07:25.660> millimeter<00:07:25.870> F<00:07:26.320> 1

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
really slow I put the 24 millimeter F 1

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.320 
really slow I put the 24 millimeter F 1
point<00:07:26.800> 4<00:07:27.010> on<00:07:27.160> there<00:07:27.370> and<00:07:27.580> it<00:07:28.150> was<00:07:28.300> really

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
point 4 on there and it was really

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.090 
point 4 on there and it was really
really<00:07:28.900> jerky<00:07:29.470> and<00:07:29.590> it<00:07:29.680> made<00:07:29.830> a<00:07:29.860> terrible

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
really jerky and it made a terrible

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.880 
really jerky and it made a terrible
noise<00:07:30.400> like<00:07:31.200> all<00:07:32.200> the<00:07:32.320> way<00:07:32.410> through<00:07:32.680> but<00:07:32.800> it

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:32.890 
noise like all the way through but it

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.470 
noise like all the way through but it
was<00:07:32.980> much<00:07:33.280> much<00:07:33.520> faster<00:07:33.730> you<00:07:34.000> could<00:07:34.150> go<00:07:34.300> from

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.480 
was much much faster you could go from

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.010 
was much much faster you could go from
one<00:07:34.570> extreme<00:07:34.960> to<00:07:35.140> the<00:07:35.290> other<00:07:35.670> in<00:07:36.750> just<00:07:37.750> about<00:07:37.960> a

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
one extreme to the other in just about a

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.080 
one extreme to the other in just about a
second<00:07:38.470> and<00:07:38.560> a<00:07:38.590> half<00:07:38.670> compared<00:07:39.670> to<00:07:39.760> this<00:07:39.850> one

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
second and a half compared to this one

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.700 
second and a half compared to this one
which<00:07:40.800> seems<00:07:41.800> to<00:07:41.980> be<00:07:42.100> 10<00:07:42.670> seconds<00:07:43.120> or<00:07:43.270> more<00:07:43.710> so

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:44.710 
which seems to be 10 seconds or more so

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.690 
which seems to be 10 seconds or more so
if<00:07:44.800> you're<00:07:44.920> thinking<00:07:45.010> about<00:07:45.160> buying<00:07:45.490> one<00:07:45.670> of

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700 
if you're thinking about buying one of

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.870 
if you're thinking about buying one of
these<00:07:45.820> I<00:07:46.570> would<00:07:47.110> recommend<00:07:47.650> trying<00:07:48.490> it<00:07:48.610> out<00:07:48.760> in

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 
these I would recommend trying it out in

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.190 
these I would recommend trying it out in
the<00:07:48.970> store<00:07:49.270> with<00:07:49.480> the<00:07:49.630> lenses<00:07:49.990> that<00:07:50.140> you

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.200 
the store with the lenses that you

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.410 
the store with the lenses that you
intend<00:07:50.620> on<00:07:50.800> trying<00:07:51.160> it<00:07:51.250> with<00:07:51.400> because<00:07:52.120> I<00:07:52.210> can't

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.420 
intend on trying it with because I can't

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.780 
intend on trying it with because I can't
possibly<00:07:52.750> comment<00:07:53.200> on<00:07:53.350> all<00:07:53.530> of<00:07:53.680> them<00:07:53.860> what

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:54.790 
possibly comment on all of them what

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.090 
possibly comment on all of them what
I've<00:07:54.910> noticed<00:07:55.180> though<00:07:55.720> the<00:07:56.020> 40<00:07:56.410> millimeter<00:07:56.950> F

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:57.100 
I've noticed though the 40 millimeter F

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.720 
I've noticed though the 40 millimeter F
2.8<00:07:57.760> pancake<00:07:58.390> lens<00:07:58.630> with<00:07:58.930> the<00:07:58.960> STM<00:07:59.530> motor

00:07:59.720 --> 00:07:59.730 
2.8 pancake lens with the STM motor

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.880 
2.8 pancake lens with the STM motor
which<00:08:00.730> is<00:08:00.760> a<00:08:00.910> new<00:08:01.210> motor<00:08:01.930> design<00:08:02.320> from<00:08:02.530> Canon

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:02.890 
which is a new motor design from Canon

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.410 
which is a new motor design from Canon
is<00:08:03.370> extremely<00:08:04.120> smooth<00:08:04.620> and<00:08:05.620> it's<00:08:06.520> sort<00:08:07.240> of<00:08:07.300> a

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:07.420 
is extremely smooth and it's sort of a

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.990 
is extremely smooth and it's sort of a
middle<00:08:07.720> speed<00:08:08.620> on<00:08:08.830> it<00:08:08.950> so<00:08:09.160> you<00:08:09.460> really<00:08:09.490> got<00:08:09.970> to

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 
middle speed on it so you really got to

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.760 
middle speed on it so you really got to
experiment<00:08:10.480> with<00:08:10.780> different<00:08:10.930> lenses<00:08:11.440> and<00:08:11.500> try

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:11.770 
experiment with different lenses and try

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.910 
experiment with different lenses and try
out<00:08:11.920> the<00:08:12.040> different<00:08:12.340> speeds<00:08:12.610> there
