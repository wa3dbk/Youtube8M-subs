00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.800 
properties that we've already discussed
the<00:01:56.520> first<00:01:56.729> property<00:01:57.180> we're<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> talk

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the first property we're going to talk

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
the first property we're going to talk
about<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.320> reacting<00:01:58.890> object<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.700> determines

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
about is reacting object this determines

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.660 
about is reacting object this determines
what<00:02:00.539> object<00:02:01.049> activates<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.799> area<00:02:02.100> condition

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
what object activates the area condition

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.969 
what object activates the area condition
by<00:02:03.149> default<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.810> set<00:02:04.109> to<00:02:04.170> game<00:02:04.469> character

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
by default it is set to game character

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
by default it is set to game character
so<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.460> your<00:02:05.609> game<00:02:05.820> character<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.539> bike

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
so if your game character is the bike

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.719 
so if your game character is the bike
the<00:02:07.200> area<00:02:07.530> condition<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.070> activate<00:02:08.520> when

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the area condition will activate when

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
the area condition will activate when
the<00:02:08.820> bike<00:02:09.060> enters<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> bubble<00:02:09.899> active<00:02:10.530> camera

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the bike enters the bubble active camera

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.860 
the bike enters the bubble active camera
uses<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> position<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> active<00:02:12.690> camera

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
uses the position of the active camera

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.860 
uses the position of the active camera
or<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.010> choose<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> custom<00:02:14.550> object<00:02:14.870> select

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
or you can choose a custom object select

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
or you can choose a custom object select
any<00:02:16.080> object<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.550> object

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
any object you like and now that object

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.270 
any object you like and now that object
will<00:02:18.180> activate<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.810> condition<00:02:19.260> change<00:02:19.530> fade

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
will activate the condition change fade

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.309 
will activate the condition change fade
determines<00:02:20.850> how<00:02:21.000> quickly<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.630> effect<00:02:21.959> occurs

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
determines how quickly the effect occurs

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.949 
determines how quickly the effect occurs
with<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.130> fade<00:02:23.459> set<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.910> 100<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
with the fade set to 100 there is a

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.410 
with the fade set to 100 there is a
gradual<00:02:25.440> change<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.640> outside<00:02:27.000> edge<00:02:27.060> of

gradual change at the outside edge of
the<00:02:27.510> bubble<00:02:27.840> there<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.110> zero<00:02:28.560> effect<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:29.430> as

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the bubble there is zero effect but as

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.250 
the bubble there is zero effect but as
you<00:02:29.730> move<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.390> bubble<00:02:30.720> morph<00:02:30.930> the

you move into the bubble morph the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
you move into the bubble morph the
change<00:02:31.530> occurs<00:02:31.860> gradually<00:02:32.120> only<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
we get into how to adjust these values

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.470 
we get into how to adjust these values
on<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.440> fly<00:02:55.650> during<00:02:55.709> gameplay<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:57.180> will<00:02:57.360> be

on the fly during gameplay this will be

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.850 
on the fly during gameplay this will be
a<00:02:57.510> useful<00:02:57.959> setting<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.500> creating
