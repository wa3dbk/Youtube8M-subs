00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 the first automesse of the year in europe 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.849
 is the ideal opportunity around 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.360
 world premieres in scene accordingly 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.670
 put 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.740
 Audi has some to go to the car salon in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.080
 geneva brought 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 he starts it once he is now 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.330
 the smallest model of ingolstÃ¤dter 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 thanks to 231 ps from the two-liter turbo 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.460
 should the top model of the a1 series potent 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 Be enough to bring new customers to the brand 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 The four wrestling also get one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.250
 world premiere is the appearance of the s3 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.530
 convertible quattro drive 300 ps power 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 in every situation and when needed until 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 to 250 km h fast 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 that is probably the most sensuous kind of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.809
 convertible drive in the top model of the a3 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.809
 be convertibles 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.270
 the next world premiere on the audi 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.160
 stand is the third generation of the tt 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.379
 the sport coupe has always been one 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 trendsetter and will remain so 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.340
 This time is the real one 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.830
 There is revolution in the cockpit to find 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 only a single display 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.880
 This is behind the steering wheel 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 positioned on it will show all 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.500
 and instruments virtually faded in 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 but that's not all, of course 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 the audi engineers have a lot of heart blood 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.640
 invested in the latest edition of the tt 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 Advance through technology will be in all 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.390
 our roi vehicles of course 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.420
 this is our idiom that is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.700
 our vision 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.990
 That's what we mean by that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.659
 the vehicles are always full with 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.780
 technology and are always the technologies 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.189
 somewhere over the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 have competition and that in 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.869
 Emotional driving fun and attractiveness 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.630
 realize 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.610
 at tt so that et is in the vehicle 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.549
 actually a very strange vehicle 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.180
 that means the design must be recognizable 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.820
 his 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.500
 the proportions must be kept 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.689
 But the whole technique is complete 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.220
 new to the vehicle but the customer 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.030
 relevant to the customer is good 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.860
 can handle 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.899
 with whom his will have fun and that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.899
 is more important when driving when driving 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.390
 have fun on the basis of the new tt 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:13.640
 would be possible shows this study called 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.890
 tt quattro sport concept 420 hp and one 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 appropriate optics are likely to be in the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.480
 tt fans worry about damp hands 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.750
 who knows audi will already guess that 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.420
 the upcoming top model tt rs guaranteed 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.420
 Some details of this study will inherit
