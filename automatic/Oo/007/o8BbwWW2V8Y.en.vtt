00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 hello everyone today i'm shooting a video like 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.250
 promised 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:15.450
 how i made a remote discovery 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:20.310
 firecrackers on the VAZ 2114 its well in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:31.800
 principle what it looks like ie signal 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:38.989
 to max prices that is something like this 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.989
 how does it work like that 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:52.430
 she looks like this 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.030
 the mechanism itself that is if we are from the console 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.030
 opening up 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.920
 an example of when this is how it works 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:16.820
 mechanism 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:23.899
 that is, it is a cable in its place I 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:29.680
 connected so long was this second 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:44.360
 the end too karstein himself affairs such here 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:52.899
 This ignorance of the bottom of the motor so that's 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.899
 the bracket is such a kind 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:07.110
 so why did I do such a principle 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.110
 here is the bracket 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.770
 this is the one that first castle 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.480
 but this is a little wrong with me 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 model 1 as I did it 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:38.170
 mirror everything just took i like this 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 corner just found it all in the garage 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:52.210
 brought the wires here here spent through here 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:55.070
 this gum end gleaming 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.620
 gum it was very difficult through her 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:06.500
 conduct 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:10.270
 then here on the roof rack and got 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.440
 here here below where we 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.810
 the hood opens that is me here 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:22.190
 the button is still separately brought out and the relay on 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.980
 I put the steering wheel on the principle of my article 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.520
 Everything is described, I took the principle of such a steering wheel 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:34.030
 Well, you can take any 4 pin relay 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:39.880
 the scheme also has everything just like with 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.880
 the remote works from the button all smoothly 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.990
 shrink to closed eat now when 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:52.880
 make woes 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:04:04.820
 no longer open it exactly the same on 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:08.540
 button we press everything worked principle 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:22.209
 all workers everything is ok so from 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:22.209
 remote control so the car did not close for some reason 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.889
 sorry 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:46.919
 breathing is not the principle from now everything 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:52.139
 closed that is here's the remote all she 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:54.919
 All work has been opened from 1 time to what 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.719
 they say that ordinary door activators 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.169
 they glitch what we immediately 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:03.840
 it does not open long live everything is fine 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:11.580
 lives well everything works no 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:14.120
 problems here is such a system here 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.930
 someone will help video with food for 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.930
 logbook drive 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.610
 subscribe put likes to all 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.610
 thank
