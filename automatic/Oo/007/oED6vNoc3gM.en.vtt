00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.660
 we are actually talking about this brown race because you can see 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.839
 television advertisements 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.429
 even the most so the packages talk about 100 percent corn 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.729
 but these factories does not enter 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.089
 a single grain of corn 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.330
 Ok here 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.599
 and with which sacks are made to for example 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.810
 these goodies that this one grabbed him child and that imposes us the payroll of 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:26.739
 small 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.549
 that you had that they are corn says to tie but has no margin coughs that 

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.010
 contains that used cardboard 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.300
 Carbinated chinet and cellulose which is a derivative of petroleum and colorants 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.050
 artificial drugs such as tartrazine 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 but do not pack they say they do not have dyes 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.870
 without we see that it is for the ing 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.100
 there is a problem the dyes are oxidized 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 and loses its naturalness that is why it is used in pro nitrates in meats and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.560
 Sodium nitrate is also used in these products. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.330
 The natural color of a product then explains how a product of these 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.720
 can maintain its color for weeks there was a for months or with the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.010
 outdoor outdoor art exhibition we all know that there's version 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.820
 official oxidation process and the color is lost then they do that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.600
 do not miss out and we already know that tartrazine of all dyes is the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 more used with the intrusion there is that to a color like this orange yellow 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.500
 like the one we see in this type of products 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.780
 I'll see how I could not show you that this organic noam that the psoe 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.119
 It's very practical where 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.920
 a petroleum derivative that peacock 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.870
 that we are not only has contributed zero with the release soon 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.010
 if the most terrible thing is that we export repertoire and do not return it 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.470
 is to report the success of ten products of the sea 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.660
 but seasoned with poisons that the most damaging 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.090
 then here we are going to show you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.120
 why 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.290
 as this is learned as a cautious as a plastic 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.270
 and that 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 if we do this with corn arepa corn crackers 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.590
 here we are not going to have that problem of getting it on fire rubber common 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.960
 these household products can appreciate in day care centers 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.530
 they are everywhere in Vienna on Thursday at colleges universities even 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.320
 Regrettably, patients have arrived at nursing hospitals 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.020
 this and when they are going to heal in no time it is difficult for these people 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.689
 they cover 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.500
 and here is exactly 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.020

 they can do it at home they can burn it, be careful you have a 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.899
 neighbor since being well forgiveness you want to want

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.079
 I was burning 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.939
 there I know that they are the fuel that makes them understand that they are acetonas and they are 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.459
 petroleum derivatives with which it is manufactured 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.780
 it is more is known in the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.780
 well in chemistry is how it deserves carbó chimenti cellulose in what 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.610
 it happens and they resell it with cardboard we already know to be able to now carlos kos 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.569
 that what they do in these products 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.199
 i know how we see those dyes that have bulls in rhinitis produces migraine 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.909
 headache also constipation emissions hundred 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.659
 in cars and to the sides has to be and have been found 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.509
 people 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:24.379
 after two or three years these products are still embedded in the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.859
 intestinal walls 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.499
 because because that does not do so much we ask that the actor must be impossible 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.879
 process the clearings and as they do not have a car shops really 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.260
 they stick we know that oil is not only removed those products 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.419
 it also comes out clothes also come out 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.199
 Lies or two flasks or bogotá ross d dictamina of a psychic dye 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:44.690
 this incident 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.410
 the oil being used in the food is being used in all 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.179
 factors in everything that has to do with the industry 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:55.129
 good because you look at the amount of time that can 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.749
 stay on 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.489
 without any combustible element apparently not what happens that the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.469
 good food fuel 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.469
 will replace it with firewood for a meat roast this magnificent 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.619
 sotomayor attack of nitrates spct to whiten the flesh not 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:12.799
 one hundred percent but fierce 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.349
 in this interesting that these things what are pressel dye additives 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.209
 I will keep cervantes 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.360
 are all of the now a chemical industry has been talked about we also saw 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.520
 in the video at the beginning the program of the colors does not 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.740
 the theme of colors is also worked 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.849
 that has nothing to do red so much not the flavors with 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.889
 with the products where supposedly comes from 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.240
 from there in luque 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.120
 what is most important of all this is that 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.999
 these products there are already multinationals 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.210
 worldwide, which are the ones 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.449
 they make these products and they have it to all countries and to all 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.910
 industries both coloring the actor before that uriz before preservatives 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.389
 then it is because it is a business then a noble person if in a 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.060
 country there is no corn harvest there is no product that has like corn 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.690
 to make this kind of food does not interest simply with oil with 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.770
 Flavoring flavorings and preservatives can make food 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.810
 there is the food 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.750
 Synthetic that is known today and who, for a long time now, is 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.620
 consuming 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.650
 as well as the pennant cigarettes 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.280
 because those products do not bring in the packaging of this warning for example 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.960
 why 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.150
 the good cigarette bring a warning you know unless there's 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.939
 the lungs that produces prisons and consume it 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.909
 openly the product 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.749
 the hair says but these products are sold as different food as 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:39.989
 food for children one wonders why it does not force us or because there is no 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:43.800
 free this idea to warn people that what they are consuming is a 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.590
 control in full swallow Japan are already banned some products like 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.550
 those that I just named as tartrazine is already banned in those 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.279
 countries 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.679
 in the united states what happens is that they are there are the largest multinationals 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.220
 are the ones that most senators put the congress of the United States before there is 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:01.990
 impossible that they themselves 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.750
 put in laws that will affect it then if the work is really 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.970
 education through the media because they will never place a label 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.300
 where she is harmful 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.370
 for health as a service very well in matters of alcohol the service of 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.470
 cigarettes and yassin to the patient roll is not showing dog 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.099
 how was it 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.300
 how was combustion to once its combustion 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.599
 the yesterday for the trash as it is consumed with fire 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.039
 i the good that we too 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.350
 we start to throw this 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.919
 where it belongs to the garbage
