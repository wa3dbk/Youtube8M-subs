00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.200
We are on our way to the north of Thailand

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.000
On our way we visit this temple, the Wat Rong Khun

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.000
This is the Golden Trangle.
Behind us flows the Mekong

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.200
There is Burma,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.000
and there is Laos

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It was a long ride, but now we arrived in Chiang Khong

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We are next to the Mekong

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We are now on the Mekong

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We are now crossing the border
Behind me is customs

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So when they give us some stamps, we will be in Laos
