00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.269
 next episode and yes it goes on with 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.429
 monaco monte carlo here at 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.859
 training Friday and yes we are watching 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.810
 again very briefly on the mails yes 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.859
 Bad cards in the team duel 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 So it is we are a bit 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.820
 behind rosberg but yes we have there too 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.099
 still enough time to go from 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 It's supposed to be okay there, weather 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.880
 we do not need to complain here 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.640
 Here you can see the last races 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 We did not have that good 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 little luck with the weather here and there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 and the rosberg is really nice too 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.020
 very strong so i would say that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 Let's try Monaco behind 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 let us and in Canada we are 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.420
 here's a big win next 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.550
 race weekend so Canada I like a lot 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.250
 like and I think we're there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.899
 Really good cards have that provided 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.899
 weather because no beating us 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 and of course there are, of course 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 still others stretch where we are very good 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.659
 So that's all it can become 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 so we're trying now first as a 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.220
 bit the training behind us 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.890
 bring the qualifying and the race 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.100
 I do not have any here either 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.810
 really great here somehow 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 hope or so made that here 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.149
 Something will be so we will be easy 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.310
 let's see how we get along here 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.560
 and then it will all be somehow 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.170
 We'll go all over again 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.450
 short in the car so we can completely 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.000
 short fat is mix turn on six 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.580
 Round gasoline should be enough and we 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 Yes, I have a task I think 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.209
 We did not think that was the sign 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.640
 would be something like that I believe that's about it 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.649
 the sign had been up at the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 Survey in the main menu that this one 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.070
 special race is good 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.980
 Monaco is not that easy 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.459
 Everywhere corners are where you really are against 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.459
 moves 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.990
 and it really is the hardest 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.510
 in the competition so also on the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.450
 It's really not easy 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:40.310
 yes that was extremely bad now 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.310
 Drove it does not exist 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.890
 We'll just look like we do now 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.050
 we have to get along a bit 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.110
 time to go that things at least once 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.000
 make a good round 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.280
 and then it should be too rich and me 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.740
 Do not want the whole powder now 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.050
 shoot but rather then tomorrow 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:07.500
 in the qualifying everything on the track 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.850
 put what we can so far up here 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.850
 Round off really well 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.220
 there we are kind of infected here 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.220
 in front too 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.490
 because I have time to rest out for 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.490
 accelerate 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.410
 yes, that was not true 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.180
 One hundred percent went well but so 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.709
 far that is alright in the tunnel 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.000
 you would actually have a drs 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.420
 Thanks to this area, you can only make zone 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.220
 not just a drs zone on the track 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.620
 off and I believe the mountain high 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.200
 I believe the mountain counts for the city 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:02.110
 also but I'm doing now is 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.050
 sure so the first round we have 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.500
 get behind us 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.500
 120 7 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.280
 not up the mountain either 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.730
 there we will be a round again 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.520
 stoking's see how we stand and 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.700
 then you should have been for today too 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.700
 his 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.580
 Half a second we are already there 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.580
 ahead 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.439
 round time environment well then we look 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.419
 Just the lap time that was now 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:46.360
 not so bad that is now too 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.949
 not ideal but you have to go here 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.360
 just keep realistic so the 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.210
 track is really very very 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.900
 Hard to drive or console either 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.900
 really easy 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.699
 The first sector was really good 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.889
 we are in the front with level in the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.749
 second sector he already one and a half 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.729
 seconds disappear and in the third 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:12.039
 sector also again one and a half to two 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.169
 and of course that's right 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.089
 big residue together as I said 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.149
 I do not want to be great here now 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:22.149
 complete training rounds 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.180
 so let's just do something like that 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:26.740
 run down a bit 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.419
 we are not quite cut off though 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.219
 I'm not full throttle yet 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.360
 given so there are still a few 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.309
 corners where we really are a bit 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.349
 can drive better 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.430
 We'll take that for tomorrow 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.349
 so a bit open 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.029
 and then I'm really, really 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.449
 curious so the last race 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.830
 they were always very, very very 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.110
 interesting so that was always right 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.620
 I believe in the first season 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.419
 We had a start here 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.889
 break off and so on and so forth 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.020
 So if things are really after 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.680
 States accident then pops it though 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.139
 We also had safety car 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.180
 also ever and I think that will 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.430
 be an interesting race again 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.409
 Tomorrow it goes but first at 12 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.879
 continue with qualifying and that would be 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.249
 nice if you then again 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:15.370
 you're good people see you 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:19.289
 then in the next episode tomorrow at 12 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.289
 in qualifying until then
