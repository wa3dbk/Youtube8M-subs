00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
made it it's amazing it's such a great

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
made it it's amazing it's such a great
looking<00:01:45.420> Mike<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.990> machining<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.500> wonderful

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
looking Mike the machining is wonderful

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.460 
looking Mike the machining is wonderful
the<00:01:47.100> engineering<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.790> marvelous<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.170> more

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the engineering is a marvelous but more

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
the engineering is a marvelous but more
importantly<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.340> capsules<00:01:50.790> themselves

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
importantly it's the capsules themselves

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
importantly it's the capsules themselves
now<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:52.079> those<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.439> guys<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.649> are

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
now for those of you guys that are

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.120 
now for those of you guys that are
familiar<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.369> high<00:01:54.060> fidelity<00:01:54.240> recording

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
familiar with high fidelity recording

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.679 
familiar with high fidelity recording
obviously<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> larger<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> capsule<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
obviously the larger the capsule the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.330 
obviously the larger the capsule the
quieter<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.040> smaller

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
quieter it is as well so with smaller

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
quieter it is as well so with smaller
capsules<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> smaller<00:02:00.600> diaphragms<00:02:01.469> they

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
capsules and smaller diaphragms they

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.490 
capsules and smaller diaphragms they
tend<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.040> more<00:02:02.310> inherently<00:02:02.670> noisy<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
tend to be more inherently noisy so the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.870 
tend to be more inherently noisy so the
larger<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> make<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> capsule<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> better

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
larger you make the capsule the better

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.340 
larger you make the capsule the better
the<00:02:06.420> better<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.049> under<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the better it's going to be under the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
the better it's going to be under the
quieter<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.429> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
quieter it's going to be as well so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
quieter it's going to be as well so
these<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:09.509> modeled<00:02:10.080> after<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> NT<00:02:10.979> for

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
these are modeled after the NT for

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.940 
these are modeled after the NT for
stereo<00:02:11.879> coincident<00:02:12.840> pair<00:02:12.989> mics

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
stereo coincident pair mics

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.750 
stereo coincident pair mics
again<00:02:14.099> it's<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> classic<00:02:15.270> X<00:02:15.510> wipe

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
again it's in the classic X wipe

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.479 
again it's in the classic X wipe
coincident<00:02:17.760> pair<00:02:18.110> position<00:02:19.250> obviously<00:02:20.250> at<00:02:20.459> a

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
coincident pair position obviously at a

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.570 
coincident pair position obviously at a
hundred<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.000> eighty<00:02:21.150> degrees<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:23.340> also

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
hundred and eighty degrees and it's also

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.490 
hundred and eighty degrees and it's also
got<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.390> capsules<00:02:24.720> also<00:02:24.989> have<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.200> little

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
got the capsules also have these little

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.589 
got the capsules also have these little
shock<00:02:25.860> mount<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.879> assume<00:02:27.120> would<00:02:27.269> be<00:02:27.390> sort

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
shock mount which I assume would be sort

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.170 
shock mount which I assume would be sort
of<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> live<00:02:27.959> system<00:02:28.340> built<00:02:29.340> into<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.970> capsule

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
of a live system built into the capsule

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.720 
of a live system built into the capsule
itself<00:02:30.660> as<00:02:30.780> well<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.590> what<00:02:32.280> we're<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.610> do

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
itself as well so what we're going to do

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.720 
itself as well so what we're going to do
today<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.269> basically<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.319> around

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
today is basically going to go around

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.309 
today is basically going to go around
parts<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.849> ibc<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.510> around<00:02:36.690> amsterdam<00:02:37.140> area

parts of ibc and around amsterdam area

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.039 
parts of ibc and around amsterdam area
and<00:02:37.440> basically<00:02:37.680> record<00:02:38.099> some<00:02:38.340> examples<00:02:39.120> or

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
and basically record some examples or

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.050 
and basically record some examples or
some<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.410> mas<00:02:40.590> straight<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.069> camera<00:02:41.340> but

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
some at mas straight to camera but

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.850 
some at mas straight to camera but
before<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.599> i'm<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.049> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.200> talk

before we do that i'm just going to talk
about<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.160> few<00:02:44.280> things<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> aesthetics<00:02:45.720> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
about a few things and the aesthetics of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.420 
about a few things and the aesthetics of
the<00:02:45.900> mic<00:02:46.200> itself<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.799> show<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.099> couple<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
the mic itself and show you a couple of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.070 
the mic itself and show you a couple of
things<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> mic<00:02:48.209> comes<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.660> again<00:02:48.930> in

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
things so the mic comes like again in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.830 
things so the mic comes like again in
like<00:02:49.709> i<00:02:49.799> said<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.069> very<00:02:50.370> robust<00:02:51.239> aluminum

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
like i said this very robust aluminum

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960 
like i said this very robust aluminum
housing<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:53.130> got<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> couple<00:02:53.819> of

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
housing and it's got a couple of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.880 
housing and it's got a couple of
features<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.780> won't<00:02:54.989> find<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.530> some<00:02:55.829> of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
features that you won't find on some of

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.539 
features that you won't find on some of
the<00:02:56.069> lower<00:02:57.000> range<00:02:57.209> Mike's<00:02:58.069> first<00:02:59.069> impressions

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
the lower range Mike's first impressions

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.479 
the lower range Mike's first impressions
again<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.000> very<00:03:00.060> heavy<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:02.099> can

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
again it's very heavy it you can

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.809 
again it's very heavy it you can
actually<00:03:02.670> use<00:03:02.849> in<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:04.230> 9-volt<00:03:05.069> battery<00:03:05.459> with

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
actually use in a 9-volt battery with

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.690 
actually use in a 9-volt battery with
this<00:03:06.060> Mike<00:03:06.420> itself<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.769> provide<00:03:08.250> power<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
this Mike itself to provide power to the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.080 
this Mike itself to provide power to the
mic<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.090> also<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:10.019> if<00:03:10.860> i'm<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:12.030> wrong

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
mic and also you can if i'm not wrong

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.229 
mic and also you can if i'm not wrong
supply<00:03:12.870> phantom<00:03:13.260> powers<00:03:13.470> well<00:03:13.799> by<00:03:14.190> many<00:03:14.730> XLR

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
supply phantom powers well by many XLR

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.740 
supply phantom powers well by many XLR
inputs<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:16.819> this<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.120> nice<00:03:18.329> features

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
inputs so this is really nice features

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.750 
inputs so this is really nice features
as<00:03:18.930> had<00:03:19.380> phantom<00:03:19.709> power<00:03:19.859> 48<00:03:20.250> volts<00:03:20.639> and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
as had phantom power 48 volts and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.050 
as had phantom power 48 volts and
balanced<00:03:21.329> outputs<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.769> can<00:03:22.920> see<00:03:23.130> here<00:03:23.609> if

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
balanced outputs as you can see here if

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.440 
balanced outputs as you can see here if
I<00:03:24.299> pull<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.720> section<00:03:25.170> out<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:26.040> will<00:03:26.160> have

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
I pull this section out you will have

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.059 
I pull this section out you will have
many<00:03:27.450> XL<00:03:27.900> ours<00:03:28.079> which<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.410> really<00:03:28.590> handy<00:03:28.680> if

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
many XL ours which is really handy if

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.410 
many XL ours which is really handy if
you<00:03:29.220> want<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.489> basically<00:03:29.639> let's<00:03:30.000> say<00:03:30.150> pipe

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you want to basically let's say pipe

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.270 
you want to basically let's say pipe
this<00:03:30.600> into<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.870> broadcast<00:03:31.380> camera<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:31.859> example

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
this into a broadcast camera for example

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.670 
this into a broadcast camera for example
so<00:03:32.760> that's<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.150> nice<00:03:33.389> besides<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.380> it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
so that's really nice besides that it

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.150 
so that's really nice besides that it
also<00:03:35.100> does<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:37.280> 2.5<00:03:38.280> 3.5<00:03:40.160> male-to-male

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
also does have 2.5 3.5 male-to-male

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.309 
also does have 2.5 3.5 male-to-male
which<00:03:41.549> means<00:03:41.819> then<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.630> also<00:03:42.780> then<00:03:42.989> pipe

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
which means then you can also then pipe

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.710 
which means then you can also then pipe
this<00:03:43.560> straight<00:03:43.889> of<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.489> output<00:03:45.030> mike<00:03:45.299> output

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
this straight of the output mike output

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.710 
this straight of the output mike output
of<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.900> camera<00:03:46.290> which<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:47.040> at<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.280> bottom

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
of this camera which is at the bottom

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.720 
of this camera which is at the bottom
okay<00:03:49.010> bottom<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.100> mike<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.639> then

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
okay bottom of mike here and then

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.750 
okay bottom of mike here and then
basically<00:03:50.910> take<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.549> hook<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.579> up

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
basically take that and hook that up

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.440 
basically take that and hook that up
into<00:03:54.060> any<00:03:54.239> camera<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.810> has<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.959> 3.5<00:03:55.670> mil<00:03:56.670> input

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
into any camera that has a 3.5 mil input

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.390 
into any camera that has a 3.5 mil input
as<00:03:57.599> well<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.319> there<00:03:58.620> two<00:03:58.769> ways<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.280> get

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
as well so there two ways you can get

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
as well so there two ways you can get
signal<00:03:59.819> a<00:04:00.150> signal<00:04:00.359> out<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.079> mike<00:04:01.349> via<00:04:02.099> the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
signal a signal out of this mike via the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.030 
signal a signal out of this mike via the
3.5<00:04:03.420> adapter<00:04:03.870> that's<00:04:03.989> supplied<00:04:04.440> with<00:04:04.920> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
3.5 adapter that's supplied with the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.370 
3.5 adapter that's supplied with the
microphone<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.700> then<00:04:06.299> down<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.930> track<00:04:07.170> I

just obviously now I've got a 9-volt
battery<00:04:23.580> powering<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.270> mic<00:04:24.419> just<00:04:24.720> press<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050

hold it down and
the<00:04:26.680> mics<00:04:26.889> power<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.490> we<00:04:27.669> have<00:04:27.790> three<00:04:28.090> options

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
the mics power so we have three options

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.129 
the mics power so we have three options
here<00:04:29.910> like<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:30.970> said<00:04:31.120> we<00:04:31.240> just<00:04:31.510> we<00:04:31.810> only<00:04:31.960> got

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
here like I said we just we only got

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.570 
here like I said we just we only got
this<00:04:32.260> Mike<00:04:32.530> probably<00:04:32.919> just<00:04:33.100> about<00:04:33.190> two<00:04:33.400> days

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
this Mike probably just about two days

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.310 
this Mike probably just about two days
ago<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.060> again<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.630> announcements<00:04:35.139> will<00:04:35.290> be

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
ago and again the announcements will be

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.830 
ago and again the announcements will be
made<00:04:35.440> two<00:04:36.430> days<00:04:36.610> from<00:04:36.729> now<00:04:36.820> actually<00:04:37.540> all<00:04:37.720> may

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
made two days from now actually all may

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.320 
made two days from now actually all may
be<00:04:38.380> made<00:04:38.560> tomorrow<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:39.520> we<00:04:39.940> got<00:04:40.120> three

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
be made tomorrow but we got three

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.360 
be made tomorrow but we got three
options<00:04:40.449> here<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.410> assume<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.100> first

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
options here so I assume the first

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.280 
options here so I assume the first
function<00:04:42.940> up<00:04:43.180> here<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.540> what<00:04:43.810> looks<00:04:44.050> like<00:04:44.139> a

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
function up here is what looks like a

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.340 
function up here is what looks like a
shelf<00:04:44.620> eq<00:04:45.010> its<00:04:45.220> 0<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.300> plus<00:04:46.600> 6<00:04:46.900> so<00:04:47.080> one<00:04:47.260> would

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
shelf eq its 0 and plus 6 so one would

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.400 
shelf eq its 0 and plus 6 so one would
assume<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:48.070> have<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.340> boost<00:04:48.639> or

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
assume that you have a boost or

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.080 
assume that you have a boost or
attenuation<00:04:50.410> of<00:04:50.620> some<00:04:50.830> sort<00:04:51.100> which<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:51.880> really

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
attenuation of some sort which is really

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.230 
attenuation of some sort which is really
handy<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:53.350> have<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.830> don't<00:04:54.760> really<00:04:54.940> know<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.150> lot

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
handy to have I don't really know a lot

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.850 
handy to have I don't really know a lot
of<00:04:55.330> mikes<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.690> actually<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.199> that<00:04:56.620> sort<00:04:56.830> of

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
of mikes that actually have that sort of

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.550 
of mikes that actually have that sort of
eq<00:04:57.400> adjustment<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.419> second<00:04:58.870> option<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.410> a

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
eq adjustment the second option is a

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.300 
eq adjustment the second option is a
high-pass<00:05:00.550> filter<00:05:00.940> which<00:05:01.479> has<00:05:01.750> zero<00:05:02.500> meaning

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
high-pass filter which has zero meaning

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.760 
high-pass filter which has zero meaning
you<00:05:03.880> just<00:05:04.210> turn<00:05:04.389> high-pass<00:05:04.810> filter<00:05:05.169> off<00:05:05.440> and

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
you just turn high-pass filter off and

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.650 
you just turn high-pass filter off and
you<00:05:05.949> can<00:05:05.979> record<00:05:06.400> flat<00:05:06.820> as<00:05:06.970> possible<00:05:07.150> or

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
you can record flat as possible or

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.010 
you can record flat as possible or
there's<00:05:08.530> two<00:05:08.770> filters<00:05:09.010> points<00:05:09.910> at<00:05:10.090> 75<00:05:10.750> hurts

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
there's two filters points at 75 hurts

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.439 
there's two filters points at 75 hurts
and<00:05:11.199> also<00:05:11.590> 150<00:05:12.340> hurts<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:12.820> meaning<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.270> if

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
and also 150 hurts so meaning that if

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.790 
and also 150 hurts so meaning that if
you're<00:05:13.600> in<00:05:13.720> any<00:05:13.960> environment<00:05:14.320> noisy

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
you're in any environment noisy

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.790 
you're in any environment noisy
environment<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:15.880> want<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.150> basically

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
environment and you want to basically

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.080 
environment and you want to basically
roll<00:05:17.800> off<00:05:17.919> your<00:05:18.070> bottom<00:05:18.190> n<00:05:18.460> you<00:05:18.760> have<00:05:18.789> that

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
roll off your bottom n you have that

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.140 
roll off your bottom n you have that
choice<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.570> rolling<00:05:20.169> off<00:05:20.289> 75<00:05:20.830> hurts<00:05:21.130> or<00:05:21.669> 100

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
choice of rolling off 75 hurts or 100

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.000 
choice of rolling off 75 hurts or 100
150<00:05:22.900> hurts<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:23.229> that's<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.470> nice<00:05:23.650> option<00:05:23.860> to

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
150 hurts so that's a nice option to

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.350 
150 hurts so that's a nice option to
have<00:05:24.100> as<00:05:24.310> well<00:05:24.490> okay<00:05:24.729> particularly<00:05:25.210> like<00:05:25.330> I

Road<00:05:51.820> has<00:05:52.090> recommended<00:05:52.720> is<00:05:52.900> that<00:05:53.080> with<00:05:53.380> a<00:05:53.410> lot

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
Road has recommended is that with a lot

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.740 
Road has recommended is that with a lot
of<00:05:53.680> their<00:05:53.950> video<00:05:54.370> might<00:05:54.690> particularly<00:05:55.690> the

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
of their video might particularly the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.860 
of their video might particularly the
videomic<00:05:56.050> pro<00:05:56.849> it's<00:05:57.849> probably<00:05:58.360> more

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
videomic pro it's probably more

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.589 
videomic pro it's probably more
important<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.979> utilize<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.849> internal<00:06:01.240> preamp

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
important to utilize the internal preamp

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.409 
important to utilize the internal preamp
so<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.870> mic<00:06:02.080> itself<00:06:02.530> then<00:06:02.770> depend<00:06:03.220> on<00:06:03.460> let's

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
so the mic itself then depend on let's

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.629 
so the mic itself then depend on let's
say<00:06:04.510> your<00:06:04.660> camera<00:06:04.960> mics<00:06:05.139> in<00:06:05.349> the<00:06:05.590> DSLR<00:06:06.160> itself

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
say your camera mics in the DSLR itself

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.570 
say your camera mics in the DSLR itself
we<00:06:07.510> know<00:06:07.810> for<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.110> fact<00:06:08.139> that<00:06:08.490> preamps<00:06:09.490> are

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
we know for a fact that preamps are

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.010 
we know for a fact that preamps are
generally<00:06:09.849> not<00:06:09.970> made<00:06:10.360> very<00:06:10.690> well<00:06:10.780> assist

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
generally not made very well assist

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.930 
generally not made very well assist
enough<00:06:11.260> thought<00:06:11.560> in<00:06:11.740> a<00:06:11.800> lot<00:06:11.919> of<00:06:11.949> cameras<00:06:12.340> so

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
enough thought in a lot of cameras so

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.089 
enough thought in a lot of cameras so
what<00:06:13.389> they<00:06:13.510> recommend<00:06:14.139> is<00:06:14.349> that<00:06:14.650> you<00:06:14.860> would

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
what they recommend is that you would

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.129 
what they recommend is that you would
normally<00:06:15.250> set<00:06:15.639> this<00:06:15.760> at<00:06:15.970> plus<00:06:16.180> 20<00:06:16.539> DB<00:06:16.570> and

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
normally set this at plus 20 DB and

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.500 
normally set this at plus 20 DB and
basically<00:06:17.889> take<00:06:18.190> down<00:06:18.400> your<00:06:18.610> DSLR<00:06:19.150> all<00:06:19.360> the

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
basically take down your DSLR all the

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.900 
basically take down your DSLR all the
way<00:06:19.660> to<00:06:19.720> you<00:06:20.260> know<00:06:20.380> just<00:06:20.800> notch<00:06:21.370> above<00:06:21.520> zero

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
way to you know just notch above zero

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.790 
way to you know just notch above zero
and<00:06:22.150> that<00:06:22.630> should<00:06:22.840> give<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.139> a<00:06:23.169> very<00:06:23.560> nice

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
and that should give you a very nice

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.610 
and that should give you a very nice
clean<00:06:24.130> signal<00:06:24.400> with<00:06:25.090> minimal<00:06:25.630> noise<00:06:26.020> so<00:06:26.440> the

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
clean signal with minimal noise so the

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.830 
clean signal with minimal noise so the
signal<00:06:26.889> noise<00:06:27.039> ratio<00:06:27.190> is<00:06:27.760> a<00:06:28.120> lot<00:06:28.389> better<00:06:28.599> than

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
signal noise ratio is a lot better than

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.040 
signal noise ratio is a lot better than
if<00:06:28.990> you<00:06:29.139> were<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.289> crank<00:06:29.560> your<00:06:30.660> input<00:06:31.660> gain<00:06:31.840> on

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
if you were to crank your input gain on

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.230 
if you were to crank your input gain on
your<00:06:32.169> camera<00:06:32.470> ok<00:06:33.010> so<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.760> mic<00:06:33.940> ships

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
your camera ok so the mic ships

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.350 
your camera ok so the mic ships
essentially<00:06:34.780> with<00:06:35.590> a<00:06:35.950> couple<00:06:36.340> of<00:06:36.430> accessories

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
essentially with a couple of accessories

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.519 
essentially with a couple of accessories
