00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.970
 what you to back no me is on a map 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.059
 created by me and two friends more than not 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.650
 are at this moment good we will begin 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.160
 here this map is pp here I have the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.160
 rules 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.390
 this of the host and the relationship 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.440
 is to play within the area area not 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.300
 break any peaceful block or juanes 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.640
 when I have I do not have your kit the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 Function for Gonzalez Bastida plays them 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.020
 well without cheating and having fun 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.940
 here that they are put in a bowl if you fall 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.690
 you come back to the spa 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 there are different types of characters from 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.800
 to play in this case we have to 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.260
 team 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.970
 the orange team red team blue and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.579
 green team and as always someone 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:04.619
 viewer on every good map 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.590
 the idea is to be maps or 6 acpm and you have to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.530
 push is like super guy smash bros his 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.159
 smash bros 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.229
 good for example bystander afterwards 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.940
 I show it for a while the last ones 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.850
 example the orange team 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.600
 let's look at our that all teams 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.300
 this is because it is the best the most 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.300
 efficient joined that is to say both prepares 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.660
 for we go to the game it's good I'm going to 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.440
 sign with stoner 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.780
 43 21 I already teleports and gives us 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.920
 definitive defects as you see will give us 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.920
 generation and those little things 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.730
 regeneration and I can survive not you 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.730
 Bush 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.360
 do not 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.140
 most of the time he told the subject 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.290
 by downloads t 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.290
 do not download it, I did it myself 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:12.860
 this map with the two friends does not help you 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.410
 pancho and a hello to them two that are going to 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.690
 build the map and you fix the horror is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.940
 good 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.200
 There are troops from combat zones in 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.800
 this case in the real world the world of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.130
 mushrooms and the ice biome not good here there 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.360
 a tree more giant than the super poop 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.360
 giant the tree 4 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.310
 they are killing us 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 this is what the good map is 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.460
 already at the beginning I have to see the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.330
 good people circuits 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.330
 we do not need 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.010
 the effects that is this 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.580
 and look beep beep 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.580
 pib 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.040
 there is a small video 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.480
 and we liked time to fix it but 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 we could not 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.610
 it is that if they played in multiple 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:25.010
 yesterday and if you like the map is multiple 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:28.380
 and that we can not open it until now 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 is that for example if you by 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.330
 such a player is in the spam and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.530
 example your friend darks 933 enters the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.620
 blue Team 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.000
 give it the blue and it may come out 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.670
 your name 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.570
 and he has entered the was going to get confused 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.840
 to be confused do not fear the equipment 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.200
 well we tried to fix them 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.200
 to fix it I go in front we go to 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.180
 good viewer first of all I want 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.930
 I want to tell you that you have a small 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.590
 editor and they can cover it the viewer is 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.799
 the first they have to enter the map 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.730
 because because if a person comes to 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.949
 enter the map of the opposing team 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.340
 come to the button to play all the 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.370
 had two or in this case 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.990
 our reader novoa 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.990
 we give effects that are 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.100
 to see the map like the others 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.650
 people are playing I do not give the guys 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.110
 I hope you liked the video this 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.870
 My first map is nothing more do not think 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.400
 in some I do not think everyone likes it 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.440
 I think you're going to like it 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.260
