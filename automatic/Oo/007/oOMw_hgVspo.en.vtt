00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.020
 so well, in general, then all over again 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.609
 Hello 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.609
 knife lovers fell knife subject 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.500
 Today such a small video reviewer 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.470
 the knife 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.820
 who gave me the correction of the cutting 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.140
 edge and sharpening just i'm his dad 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:30.250
 held it looked I really liked 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:36.629
 In general, this is a knife from Zlatoust 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:40.720
 Air companies I was looking for what kind of knife 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:45.930
 on the Internet because the name on it 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.930
 no this model snipe 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.780
 I really liked how fixed 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.780
 legs in a sheath 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.680
 very nice you can by the way leather 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:12.750
 great made stitched suspension all 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.750
 perfectly harreh the knife itself is made 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.730
 so let's say a complete set 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.880
 he has a bilster reed made of 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.880
 aluminum 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.370
 the tree is like a nut that is a hilt 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:37.460
 nut and such prostavochki go here from 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:43.300
 PCB that's fine just a knife sits 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 in the hand is just great so much 95 x 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.090
 18 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.090
 Zlatoust 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240
 but 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:02.430
 yes such small images on it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.430
 birds see this very picasso 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.630
 according to some technical characteristics 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.930
 I quickly just tell you the data with 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.020
 top official site 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:20.650
 length 260 millimeters just the same length 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:25.250
 with night 135 butt thickness 2 and 4 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.580
 millimeter although I didnâ€™t look at it 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.660
 view 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.020
 it looks like it's in the area closer to three 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.780
 on 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.780
 I did not try on therefore I will not argue 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.810
 hardness stated. 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.810
 58 rockwell units 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.310
 so very neatly done all reduced 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.030
 exactly 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.709
 in general, makes me happy and straight 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.250
 looked can be said deepened here 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.250
 knife 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.120
 the only thing that could be a little bit 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:15.519
 Here is a pen to make a little bit already 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.569
 little thinner too healthy 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.519
 the boot is not very strong on it 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.380
 straining but maybe my hand is just 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.960
 so nothing big 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.830
 I do not know 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.830
 I would do 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.600
 in their place a little bit and and 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:40.940
 let me so sky 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.450
 but in general legs just fine on 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.290
 cutting edge were 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 it's together 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.870
 kicked on was deep 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.050
 corrected everything 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.819
 here 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.410
 peed feet 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:12.150
 just and so understands the teacher such here 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.950
 which points along the cutting edge well in 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.760
 overall was a nightmare did not cut the paper 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.549
 almost now paper cuts with 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.900
 twist 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.560
 I will not just show the paper in advance 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.560
 cooked 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.900
 you take the word yes 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.720
 so that 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.029
 This knife can be safely taken as 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.419
 tourist knife so here 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:44.749
 I think hunting is quite suitable 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.649
 he dragged on for a long time took him 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:49.949
 that is, steel 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:52.979
 I think that corresponds to the hardness 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.980
 began to correspond to the stated yes and 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.450
 as much as 95 x 18 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.450
 quite so nothing 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.700
 reverse grip 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.750
 should right hand ask here just 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.540
 knows the hilt of a bow asks 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.730
 a little more of my here 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.040
 and my hand is bigger, more perfect 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:24.830
 requirements 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.520
 so for some more massive 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.970
 hunters and tourists 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.430
 just a wonderful knife and even they 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.630
 written on the site that the knife snipe is 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.220
 absolute sales leader 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.280
 holding in his hands and looking at him 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.250
 willingly believe it 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.030
 here 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.870
 so that 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.550
 I recommend I recommend everything to everyone 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.550
 thanks bye bye
