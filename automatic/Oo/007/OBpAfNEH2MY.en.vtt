 By the way It is also famous Youtuber Seto Paul's unfortunately the same thing 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.130
 I bought it, but you seem to have caught a defective product 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.370

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.480
 There is an instruction manual, and the packing material is divided into two steps like this. 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.810
 It is lower 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.780
 It comes with a stand 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.780
 apple This is the main unit, which is convenient. 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:14.570
 This is a small item of this product, but its specific usage is 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.160
 I will put a video link of the happiness I introduced earlier, so if you get a look at that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.350
 Detailed explanation is listed 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.110
 So I used to lock it on the iphone's microphone without using it and then 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.840
 Voice and sound when using this Eyring microphone cast 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:34.700
 I would like to compare 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 I'm recording with iphone 5 built-in microphone now distance from me to iphone now 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.750
 It is a place called about 1.2 3m 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:49.660
 I wonder if there is white noise now or how it sounds 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.440
 Next I am wearing Airikuma role cast now The other conditions are exactly the same 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.010
 is not it 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.410
 Is the way of hearing changed? 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:01.940
 I've put the cause into a range state earlier but now I'm taking it low 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.940
 How does it sound 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.270
 High 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:17.140
 Yes I'm playing it with my earphones before I edited the video I've been following . 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:22.840
 It's totally different, but even White is much reduced 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.550
 I 'm looking forward to the video editing has been reduced at a level that is quite surprising, but I 'm looking forward to 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.150
 When doing video editing with yes 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:36.960
 It should be a machine that likes a microphone 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 Sometimes when you take a picture while doing something like this, you can use a microphone here 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:46.850
 Oppositely , you should aim at yourself, so switch the cause to low 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:51.920
 In this way I think my voice will be just right 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:55.810
 If you want to upload the essence without spending too much money Airi Miya Mike cast about haiku 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.810
