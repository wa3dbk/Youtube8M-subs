00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
manual versus t-tail but today what I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
manual versus t-tail but today what I
want<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> talked<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:40.980> it's

how<00:02:00.180> dark<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.810> room<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.259> compared<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
how dark your room is compared to the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.429 
how dark your room is compared to the
next<00:02:02.399> person<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.060> use<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.079> grain<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
next person so use these really grain of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.530 
next person so use these really grain of
salt<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.340> recipe<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.329> use

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
salt but this is my recipe that we use

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.479 
salt but this is my recipe that we use
it<00:02:06.719> every<00:02:07.140> single<00:02:07.170> wedding<00:02:07.649> reception<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
it every single wedding reception and

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.040 
it every single wedding reception and
then<00:02:08.940> fine<00:02:09.239> tune<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
then fine tune it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.660 
then fine tune it
our<00:02:10.320> ISO<00:02:11.070> we<00:02:11.610> set<00:02:11.910> anywhere<00:02:12.690> from<00:02:13.050> about<00:02:13.670> 640

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
our ISO we set anywhere from about 640

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.650 
nice candle lights maybe some up
lighting<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.940> want<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.210> preserve<00:02:51.390> that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660

ambient<00:02:52.650> lighting<00:02:52.860> right<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.000> need<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
ambient lighting right so you need to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.570 
ambient lighting right so you need to
have<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.570> slower<00:02:55.230> shutter<00:02:55.440> speed<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.160> let<00:02:56.340> in

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
have a slower shutter speed to let in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.760 
have a slower shutter speed to let in
more<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> ambient<00:02:57.600> lighting

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
more of the ambient lighting

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.120 
more of the ambient lighting
now<00:02:59.390> given<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:01.620> might<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
now given that you might have the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.040 
now given that you might have the
opposite<00:03:02.580> end<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.940> spectrum<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.600> it's<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
opposite end of the spectrum that it's a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.930 
opposite end of the spectrum that it's a
very<00:03:04.320> bright<00:03:04.680> room<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.220> then<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.400> don't<00:03:05.730> need

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
very bright room and then you don't need

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.120 
very bright room and then you don't need
to<00:03:06.060> let<00:03:06.210> in<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.390> lot<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.660> ambient<00:03:07.050> lighting<00:03:07.230> so

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
to let in a lot of ambient lighting so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.450 
to let in a lot of ambient lighting so
lo<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.430> behold<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:09.200> good<00:03:10.200> rule<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.560> thumb<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:11.070> a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
lo and behold a good rule of thumb is a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.500 
lo and behold a good rule of thumb is a
shutter<00:03:12.390> speed<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:12.990> one<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.520> 40th<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.209> a

but<00:03:22.980> remember<00:03:23.459> your<00:03:23.940> Flash<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.570> what's<00:03:24.780> going

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
but remember your Flash is what's going

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.990 
but remember your Flash is what's going
to<00:03:25.020> do<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.410> job<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.890> freezing<00:03:26.370> your<00:03:26.490> subject

not<00:03:27.570> your<00:03:27.810> shutter<00:03:28.050> speed<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.709> you're<00:03:29.190> okay<00:03:29.580> in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
not your shutter speed so you're okay in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.240 
not your shutter speed so you're okay in
that<00:03:29.880> range<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.450> for<00:03:30.690> us<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.800> darker

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
that range and for us in a darker

wedding<00:03:32.610> reception<00:03:33.420> room<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.750> lot<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.470> times

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
wedding reception room a lot of times

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.540 
wedding reception room a lot of times
we're<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.310> 140th<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.240> 180th<00:03:36.870> range<00:03:37.459> but<00:03:38.459> if

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
we're in the 140th to 180th range but if

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.949 
we're in the 140th to 180th range but if
it's<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:39.030> bright<00:03:39.270> sometimes<00:03:39.570> we're<00:03:39.930> even

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
it's really bright sometimes we're even

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.730 
it's really bright sometimes we're even
higher<00:03:40.680> than<00:03:40.920> 1/100<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:43.200> aperture

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
higher than 1/100 and for aperture

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.440 
higher than 1/100 and for aperture
that's<00:03:44.310> sort<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.850> personal<00:03:45.180> preference

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
that's sort of a personal preference

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.530 
that's sort of a personal preference
thing<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.260> me<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.880> having<00:03:47.880> shallower

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
thing but for me I like having shallower

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.050 
thing but for me I like having shallower
depth<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.990> field<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.590> still<00:03:50.100> even<00:03:50.850> out<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
depth of field so I still even out of

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.360 
depth of field so I still even out of
the<00:03:51.150> dance<00:03:51.360> floor<00:03:51.720> I'm<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.709> know<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:52.830> want<00:03:53.250> my

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
the dance floor I'm you know I want my

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.790 
the dance floor I'm you know I want my
subject<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.300> focus<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.870> want<00:03:55.170> sort<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.740> a

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
subject in focus but I want sort of a

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.560 
subject in focus but I want sort of a
nice<00:03:55.950> blur<00:03:56.280> behind<00:03:56.730> them<00:03:56.940> maybe<00:03:57.270> you<00:03:57.420> got<00:03:57.540> that

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
nice blur behind them maybe you got that

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.480 
nice blur behind them maybe you got that
nice<00:03:57.900> lighting<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.800> want<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.340> up

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
nice lighting that you want that up

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.890 
nice lighting that you want that up
lighting<00:03:59.880> or<00:04:00.000> twinkle<00:04:00.480> lights<00:04:00.660> or<00:04:00.870> candles

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
lighting or twinkle lights or candles

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.290 
lighting or twinkle lights or candles
you<00:04:01.380> want<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.620> get<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.860> nice<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.070> blurred<00:04:02.490> so

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
you want to get that nice and blurred so

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.699 
you want to get that nice and blurred so
for<00:04:03.540> us

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
for us

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.430 
for us
we<00:04:05.100> shoot<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.550> lot<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> times<00:04:06.120> at<00:04:06.390> F<00:04:06.600> 2.2

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
we shoot a lot of the times at F 2.2

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.560 
we shoot a lot of the times at F 2.2
with<00:04:07.830> their<00:04:07.980> primes<00:04:09.140> -<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.950> know<00:04:11.070> -<00:04:11.130> f4<00:04:11.760> so

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
with their primes - you know - f4 so

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.820 
with their primes - you know - f4 so
let's<00:04:12.870> recap<00:04:14.360> use<00:04:15.360> aperture<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:16.169> control<00:04:16.590> how

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
let's recap use aperture to control how

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.479 
let's recap use aperture to control how
much<00:04:17.010> flash<00:04:17.400> exposure<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.450> want<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
much flash exposure you want the the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.340 
much flash exposure you want the the
higher<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.060> f-stop<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
higher the f-stop the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.110 
higher the f-stop the
the<00:04:22.980> harder<00:04:23.250> you're<00:04:23.370> flashing<00:04:23.550> after<00:04:23.940> works

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
the harder you're flashing after works

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.460 
the harder you're flashing after works
that's<00:04:24.300> going<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.570> sort<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.900> let<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.350> little

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
that's going to sort of let in a little

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.990 
that's going to sort of let in a little
less<00:04:27.050> less<00:04:28.050> brightness<00:04:28.590> from<00:04:28.770> your<00:04:28.920> flash<00:04:29.130> we

way up to 1/100 of a second and ISO also
going<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:04.950> be<00:05:05.460> dependent<00:05:05.940> upon<00:05:05.970> how<00:05:06.270> dark<00:05:06.660> or

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
going to be dependent upon how dark or

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.050 
going to be dependent upon how dark or
how<00:05:06.960> bright<00:05:07.260> your<00:05:07.410> room<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.040> for<00:05:08.880> me

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
how bright your room is and for me

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.700 
how bright your room is and for me
that's<00:05:09.270> quite<00:05:09.630> often<00:05:09.840> between<00:05:11.000> 642<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:13.350> ISO

going to want to play around with those
settings<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.610> really<00:05:21.150> get<00:05:21.750> something<00:05:22.020> that

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
settings and really get something that

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
is going to be a little different but

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.310 
is going to be a little different but
those<00:05:25.650> are<00:05:25.860> my<00:05:26.030> starting<00:05:27.030> points<00:05:27.330> if<00:05:27.480> you<00:05:28.080> want

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
those are my starting points if you want

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.010 
those are my starting points if you want
one<00:05:28.590> place<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:29.040> start<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:30.240> would<00:05:30.840> recommend

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
one place to start and I would recommend

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.470 
one place to start and I would recommend
how<00:05:31.620> about<00:05:31.920> F<00:05:32.130> 3.2<00:05:33.230> ISO<00:05:34.430> 1/100<00:05:35.490> I'm<00:05:36.210> sorry

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
how about F 3.2 ISO 1/100 I'm sorry

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
how about F 3.2 ISO 1/100 I'm sorry
shutter<00:05:36.810> speed<00:05:37.110> 1/100<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:37.800> ISO<00:05:38.630> 800<00:05:39.630> try<00:05:40.260> that

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
shutter speed 1/100 and ISO 800 try that

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.840 
shutter speed 1/100 and ISO 800 try that
and<00:05:40.740> then<00:05:40.860> go<00:05:41.040> ahead<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.490> make<00:05:41.700> your

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
and then go ahead and make your

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.890 
and then go ahead and make your
adjustments<00:05:41.940> from<00:05:42.360> there<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.840> think

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
adjustments from there and I think

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.990 
adjustments from there and I think
you'll<00:05:43.230> be<00:05:43.350> all<00:05:43.500> set<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.340> getting<00:05:44.790> some

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
you'll be all set and getting some

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.540 
you'll be all set and getting some
awesome<00:05:45.180> photos<00:05:45.900> with<00:05:46.290> your<00:05:46.620> speedlight

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
awesome photos with your speedlight
