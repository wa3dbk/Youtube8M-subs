00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.720
 I'm going to teach you today to make a 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:13.139
 electricity generator 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.670
 here is a microwave engine 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.340
 those of the dish 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.869
 I have two here of 2 junk and that I 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.140
 found it 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.990
 then I did the rodeo experience here and 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 I put it here at the last minute to see 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:37.510
 how much did it show how I'm going to put it here? 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.820
 in the car 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:49.300
 you see how much they produce 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:53.670
 electricity in the box here and here I go 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 fit each 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.440
 this last cable 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:25.380
 only with this crap over there 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.520
 now I'll call the network back in 1 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 600 volts because here I do not know how much 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 I'll be able to generate I made a lever 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
 here but only that she has to finish it 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.640
 is not working very well here that is 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.940
 turning then I'll turn with pliers me 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.720
 see how much electricity will generate 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:02:00.479
 that a small turn saw that already 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:03.600
 generated almost 1 100 volts per year 120 and can 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.259
 go anywhere and that goes the same 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.259
 voltage 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.620
 How can you guys see there guys, I do not have 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.840
 fear that if you also put this 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.750
 part here or a charger attaches any 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.700
 It's going to work like that. 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.709
 take a test here 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:45.560
 wait there how they had loaded 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.560
 on the edge and I'll see if it works here 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:03:03.709
 when the jaguar spins here so much 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.709
 they can release a friend 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:22.100
 look here 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 marked that is loading river mark 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:44.960
 here on the cell phone battery charging 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:48.920
 director of the film will show a small 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:04:00.590
 problem here O handle is very 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:04:03.190
 Only one more tip is what we already have. 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.190
 to close 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.660
 I 'll show the battery here. 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.560
 then it is these people and even the 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 next 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.160
 thanks
