00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.570
 hello your world today I you 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.000
 found for a high quality and I 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.100
 will you do a review on the water of 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.020
 pink kind I talk about it enough 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.690
 a long time and I told myself that a magazine 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.240
 impose yourself because you are a lot to 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.030
 ask me what is that how 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.400
 how does it work what is it 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.320
 changes compared to other products 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.930
 what's more, what's the point 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.789
 serves and his firsts - what's the point 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 it's used to tone and a little bit 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.739
 moisturize your skin 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.249
 sam has also freshened so it's very 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.230
 convenient 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.780
 what's the little plus it's 100% 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.249
 natural is very everything and it's great 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.460
 they are super good ben it leaves the skin 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.670
 fresh 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.899
 that's a lot of reasons 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.670
 I have one from Christian at 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.399
 lennart but you can find some 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.489
 any brand and it's 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.229
 really something great since 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.879
 it's natural for all types 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.799
 skin and that's really a bonus 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.199
 that is, anyone can 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.179
 have unlike rosemary in the 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.469
 lavender and it's the rose water it's 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.400
 for all skin types you can 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.770
 find in all major 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.939
 surfaces the Christian liÃ©nard is 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.500
 prevalent in a lot of big 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.420
 surfaces now there are all 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.789
 the brands and there is the nuxe brand that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.229
 went to landreau also but she 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.880
 did not do that only water 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.210
 pink to the friend of things to the excerpt of 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.259
 pink especially this cleansing water 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.880
 micellar that are super good ago 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.270
 a whole range like that to extracts from 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.079
 pink so like why rose water 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.079
 it's really awesome 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.520
 so how do you use it this is a 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.719
 question that many also you me 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.759
 ask you wash your face 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.630
 pretty much everything I think if you tell me 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.210
 do not do it so you are 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.700
 wash your face so with a cleanser 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.939
 like this one for example any 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.679
 which cleanser the problem is that 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.170
 without knowing it there are residents 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.450
 soap scum on your skin and who 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.750
 can get stuck in and it's not a 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.800
 first soap embedded in the skin 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.480
 for that it does not take to clean your 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.239
 skin with soap like shower gel 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.860
 it's hard living and after you do 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.360
 nothing you put directly your cream 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.040
 and forgiveness 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.989
 even if you put like me I do 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 a thermal water that will not remove this 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 soap this soap even with water it's fine 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.849
 not leave 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.120
 that's why rose water is 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.860
 it's ideal from all this source 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.360
 before you can leave others 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.950
 mail cleaner with roses is ideal 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.510
 since there in for example there is 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.650
 so we waited until I told you 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.260
 nonsense 99.3% of the ingredients that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.220
 are of natural origin 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.370
 the only thing while it's 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.920
 alcohol but it's really a killer 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.690
 it smells great wind and that's the big thing 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.700
 strong point now how does the master 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.680
 which either you do as you can 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.410
 you sprinkle it I do not know you put 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.579
 in a chic and then you sprayed it on 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.769
 the face is like you want you 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.150
 can use in the way that you 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.340
 prefer but the most practical 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.870
 it's on cotton you put that on 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.139
 cotton you pass all over your face 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.970
 and your sword is removed from your skin and 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.530
 tone up and as I told you 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.940
 it's for all skin types 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.560
 there is no problem on it 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.510
 can not tell you now if I 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.579
 put it that will not necessarily be adapted to 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.950
 my skin and if you do not know what is 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.410
 your skin type like that you can 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.730
 use it without worry while all 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.290
 the others by cleaning his for a guy 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.650
 of face skin and for all types of 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.440
 skin and little bonus for those who have 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.989
 Acne not attack your skin and 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.519
 blow it's not going to create more sebum 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.230
 not remove more sebum and that makes 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.540
 prevent it from spreading 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.829
 so here I hope that my little review 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.480
 will you have more than I would have you 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.609
 convinced it's really something 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.530
 awesome it is cheaper and less I 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.480
 would buy again and again 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.100
 I'm done here, it's my second 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.410
 and I bought a third one already 2 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.730
 so to tell you that I love after 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.040
 I try to christian menard but 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.570
 even if imagine the arlette I 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.610
 would take autocross water from 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.190
 pink and I would say that's the product 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.500
 that I use that I will use again and 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.660
 again it's for everyone everyone 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.910
 ages and that's fine you can 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.230
 put that in your budget if you 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.459
 want a baby for example your 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.110
 little sister or a little brother 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.880
 it's for everybody it feels very 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.560
 good and then like that and it's someone 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.370

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.960
 now its end so that's it 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.530
