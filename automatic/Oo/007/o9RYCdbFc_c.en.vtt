Diaz<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.720> turn<00:05:44.080> this<00:05:44.290> around<00:05:44.530> yeah<00:05:44.890> and<00:05:45.070> maybe

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
Diaz to turn this around yeah and maybe

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.470 
Diaz to turn this around yeah and maybe
that's<00:05:45.460> why<00:05:45.580> Jimmy<00:05:45.820> Strickland<00:05:46.180> didn't<00:05:46.390> even

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
that's why Jimmy Strickland didn't even

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.110 
that's why Jimmy Strickland didn't even
ask<00:05:46.660> for<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:46.990> knock<00:05:47.170> out<00:05:47.470> you<00:05:48.040> know<00:05:48.130> try<00:05:49.090> to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
ask for the knock out you know try to

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.350 
ask for the knock out you know try to
give<00:05:49.480> me<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.630> couple<00:05:49.960> of<00:05:50.140> knock<00:05:50.380> downs<00:05:51.360> start

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
give me a couple of knock downs start

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.530 
give me a couple of knock downs start
think<00:05:53.580> maybe<00:05:54.580> we<00:05:54.760> can<00:05:54.910> get<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.330> higher

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
think maybe we can get to that higher

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.170 
think maybe we can get to that higher
level<00:05:55.900> but<00:05:56.800> there's<00:05:57.400> just<00:05:57.610> been<00:05:57.760> nothing<00:05:57.910> in

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
level but there's just been nothing in

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.520 
level but there's just been nothing in
the<00:05:58.240> fight<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.570> demonstrate<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.140> so<00:05:59.260> far

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
the fight to demonstrate it so far

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.020 
the fight to demonstrate it so far

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
because among other things you know

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.630 
because among other things you know
either<00:06:01.270> Diaz<00:06:01.690> doesn't<00:06:02.530> have<00:06:02.890> big<00:06:03.130> powerlinux

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
either Diaz doesn't have big powerlinux

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
or loses chin is more than up into -

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.370 
or loses chin is more than up into -
Diaz<00:06:06.610> really<00:06:07.210> needs<00:06:07.419> to<00:06:07.570> step<00:06:07.900> it<00:06:08.110> up<00:06:08.200> right

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
Diaz really needs to step it up right
