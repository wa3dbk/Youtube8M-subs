it this map is actually very very simple
everything<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.659> on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hit every every point the way I did it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
hit every every point the way I did it
as<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> started<00:02:06.570> by<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.750> north<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.740> I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and I finished

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.970 
and I finished

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
in the southern part of the map as for

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.300 
in the southern part of the map as for
any<00:02:15.099> difficulties<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.420> one<00:02:16.599> skill<00:02:16.870> point<00:02:17.310> is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
any difficulties this one skill point is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.940 
any difficulties this one skill point is
in<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.640> top<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.349> northwest<00:02:20.349> corner<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.799> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
in the top the northwest corner of the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.349 
in the top the northwest corner of the
map<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> North<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.060> actually

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
map all the way the North I actually

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.550 
map all the way the North I actually
thought<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:22.780> was<00:02:22.900> part<00:02:23.109> of<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.260> different

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
thought this was part of a different

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.649 
thought this was part of a different
zone<00:02:23.739> but<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.459> not<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:24.879> actually<00:02:25.269> part<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
zone but it's not it's actually part of

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.229 
zone but it's not it's actually part of
the<00:02:25.959> fields<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:26.890> ruin<00:02:27.189> and<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.579> get<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.879> by<00:02:28.030> you

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
the fields of ruin and you get it by you

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.789 
the fields of ruin and you get it by you
know<00:02:28.359> you<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.079> go<00:02:29.139> to<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.319> dragon<00:02:29.650> rot

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
know you have to go to the dragon rot

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.349 
know you have to go to the dragon rot
domains<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.549> follow<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:30.879> road<00:02:30.939> north

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
domains and just follow this road north

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.879 
domains and just follow this road north
and<00:02:31.659> then<00:02:31.900> it'll<00:02:32.079> come<00:02:32.260> through<00:02:32.290> here<00:02:32.709> and

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
and then it'll come through here and

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.379 
and then it'll come through here and
you'll<00:02:33.040> see<00:02:33.189> a<00:02:33.219> little<00:02:33.370> passageway<00:02:33.879> here<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
you'll see a little passageway here it

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.550 
you'll see a little passageway here it
actually<00:02:34.480> doesn't<00:02:34.810> look<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.079> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.290> enter

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
actually doesn't look like you can enter

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.890 
actually doesn't look like you can enter
it<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:35.769> as<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:35.950> can<00:02:36.069> see<00:02:36.219> here<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.549> can

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it but as you can see here you can

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.209 
it but as you can see here you can
there's<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> little<00:02:38.139> shadowy<00:02:38.829> figure

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
there's like a little shadowy figure

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.440 
there's like a little shadowy figure
around<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.700> let<00:02:39.790> me<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.090> if<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.359> go

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
around it let me just see if I can go

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.640 
around it let me just see if I can go
outside<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.989> show<00:02:41.139> you<00:02:41.230> guys<00:02:41.349> what<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.620> looks

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.589 
one here is in the wild and narrows you
pretty<00:03:12.219> much<00:03:12.280> can<00:03:12.579> either<00:03:12.669> come<00:03:13.000> from<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.389> top

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
pretty much can either come from the top

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.030 
pretty much can either come from the top
way<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.139> and<00:03:14.260> come<00:03:14.799> down<00:03:15.010> across<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:16.299> I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
way here and come down across but I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.960 
way here and come down across but I
think<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.129> better<00:03:18.250> coming<00:03:18.459> from<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.790> south

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
think it's better coming from the south

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.610 
think it's better coming from the south
here<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.449> run<00:03:19.569> up<00:03:19.659> here<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:19.900> there'll

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
here you just run up here and there'll

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.229 
here you just run up here and there'll
be<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.739> little<00:03:20.919> passageway<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.609> come<00:03:21.909> up<00:03:22.060> and

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
be a little passageway to come up and

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.780 
be a little passageway to come up and
inside<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.930> here<00:03:23.139> there<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.440> champion<00:03:23.979> event

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
inside of here there is a champion event

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.969 
inside of here there is a champion event
that<00:03:25.329> goes<00:03:25.359> on<00:03:25.659> here<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.199> it<00:03:26.379> might<00:03:26.560> be<00:03:26.590> spawn

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
that goes on here so it might be spawn

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.559 
that goes on here so it might be spawn
but<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.489> always<00:03:27.609> just<00:03:27.790> run<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.299> get

but you can always just run in and get

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.559 
but you can always just run in and get
