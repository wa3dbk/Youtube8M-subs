okay<00:00:32.320> you're<00:00:32.619> going<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.860> lower<00:00:33.040> it<00:00:33.190> in

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.250 

are<00:00:39.530> now<00:00:40.160> now<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:40.970> don't<00:00:41.390> have<00:00:41.570> any<00:00:41.750> chemical

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
are now now we don't have any chemical

biodegradable cleaning solution it's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.460 
biodegradable cleaning solution it's
non-toxic<00:00:52.120> non-hazardous<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:54.050> goes<00:00:54.200> right

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
non-toxic non-hazardous it goes right

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.250 
non-toxic non-hazardous it goes right
down<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.710> drain<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:56.239> we<00:00:56.450> use<00:00:56.629> our<00:00:56.809> tip<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
down the drain and we use our tip and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.570 
down the drain and we use our tip and
measure<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:58.360> make<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.540> really<00:01:00.230> simple<00:01:00.470> now<00:01:01.430> if

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
measure to make it really simple now if

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.160 
measure to make it really simple now if
we<00:01:01.699> need<00:01:01.879> something<00:01:02.239> more<00:01:02.390> aggressive<00:01:02.629> we

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
we need something more aggressive we

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:13.679 
we need something more aggressive we
have<00:01:03.410> some<00:01:03.650> other<00:01:03.800> options<00:01:04.309> for<00:01:04.430> cleaners

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.920 

just<00:01:14.290> start<00:01:14.619> with<00:01:14.770> this

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.050 

and<00:01:18.410> we're<00:01:18.560> going<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.860> do<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.250> at<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.520> 25

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
and we're going to do this at a 25

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.590 
and we're going to do this at a 25
kilohertz<00:01:20.540> frequency<00:01:21.670> okay<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.210> can<00:01:23.390> do<00:01:23.480> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
kilohertz frequency okay you can do the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.720 
kilohertz frequency okay you can do the
honor<00:01:23.780> step<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> foot<00:01:24.620> pedal<00:01:24.800> this<00:01:25.490> one

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
honor step on the foot pedal this one

00:01:25.730 --> 00:02:14.160 
honor step on the foot pedal this one
yep<00:01:26.090> one<00:01:26.630> time<00:01:26.840> tap

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.540 

all<00:02:14.650> right<00:02:14.770> now<00:02:15.340> we're<00:02:15.490> going<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> bring<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.000> up

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.949 

looks<00:02:24.550> pretty<00:02:24.819> good<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.240> this<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
looks pretty good now that this is the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.000 
looks pretty good now that this is the
10-minute<00:02:26.530> bar

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
10-minute bar

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.449 
10-minute bar
tell<00:02:27.880> me<00:02:28.030> okay<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.170> outside<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.890> case<00:02:30.190> is

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
tell me okay the outside of this case is

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:43.710 
tell me okay the outside of this case is
rough<00:02:31.030> yes<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:32.020> woman<00:02:32.290> approve<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.569> is

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
rough yes a woman approve so this is

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.050 
rough yes a woman approve so this is
what<00:02:43.870> we're<00:02:44.020> really<00:02:44.050> looking<00:02:44.410> at<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:48.060> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
what we're really looking at here this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.900 
what we're really looking at here this
is<00:02:49.270> where<00:02:49.480> all<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.810> activity<00:02:50.440> takes<00:02:50.650> place

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
is where all the activity takes place

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.580 
is where all the activity takes place
when<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.060> transmission<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.900> assembled<00:02:53.470> then

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
when the transmission is assembled then

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.410 
when the transmission is assembled then
in<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.920> car<00:02:54.510> these<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:56.530> passages<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
in the car these little passages in the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.070 
in the car these little passages in the
industry<00:02:58.959> are<00:02:59.140> called<00:02:59.470> worm<00:03:00.180> tracks<00:03:01.180> they're

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
industry are called worm tracks they're

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.380 
industry are called worm tracks they're
similar<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.620> what<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.250> worm<00:03:03.519> would<00:03:03.760> do<00:03:03.940> if<00:03:04.150> it's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
similar to what a worm would do if it's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.759 
similar to what a worm would do if it's
buried<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.230> earth<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.000> making<00:03:07.000> its<00:03:07.180> way

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
buried in the earth and making its way

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.970 
buried in the earth and making its way
there<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.980> passages<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:10.170> allow<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.230> oil<00:03:11.470> to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
there the passages that allow the oil to

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.729 
there the passages that allow the oil to
go<00:03:12.130> where<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> engineers<00:03:13.060> want<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.200> oil<00:03:14.230> to

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
go where the engineers want the oil to

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.610 
go where the engineers want the oil to
go<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.610> operate<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.209> various<00:03:16.660> friction<00:03:17.440> and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
go to operate the various friction and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.310 
go to operate the various friction and
driving<00:03:18.100> elements<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.480> transmission

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
driving elements in the transmission

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.650 
driving elements in the transmission
this<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.100> what<00:03:21.489> cleanliness<00:03:21.820> is<00:03:22.360> most

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
this is what cleanliness is most

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.289 
this is what cleanliness is most
important<00:03:23.410> as<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.489> see<00:03:24.700> I'm<00:03:24.880> loosening

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
important as you can see I'm loosening

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.319 
important as you can see I'm loosening
what<00:03:26.170> used<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.530> be<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.829> gaskets<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:28.060> my

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
what used to be the gaskets with my

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.110 
what used to be the gaskets with my
thumbnails<00:03:28.900> which<00:03:29.290> are<00:03:29.530> pretty<00:03:29.829> well<00:03:30.130> worn

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
thumbnails which are pretty well worn

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.810 
thumbnails which are pretty well worn
out<00:03:31.420> at<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.840> stage<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.220> can<00:03:33.430> see<00:03:33.670> how

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
out at this stage but you can see how

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.949 
out at this stage but you can see how
easily<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:35.010> baked-on<00:03:36.010> gaskets<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.880> come<00:03:37.750> off

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
easily the baked-on gaskets to come off

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.519 
easily the baked-on gaskets to come off
the<00:03:38.890> castings
