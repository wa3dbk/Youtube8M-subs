in<00:02:07.170> WWE<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.090> worries<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.509> because

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in WWE this is what worries me because

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.250 
in WWE this is what worries me because
like<00:02:10.800> Sin<00:02:11.670> Cara

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
like Sin Cara

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.820 
like Sin Cara
cabal<00:02:13.709> was<00:02:14.430> also<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.239> person<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.870> seen<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.560> far

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
cabal was also a person I seen going far

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.539 
cabal was also a person I seen going far
in<00:02:17.069> WWE<00:02:17.879> but<00:02:18.540> unfortunately<00:02:19.439> didn't<00:02:20.280> happen

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
in WWE but unfortunately didn't happen

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.819 
in WWE but unfortunately didn't happen
for<00:02:20.700> him<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.629> I'm<00:02:21.870> hoping<00:02:22.439> this<00:02:22.590> doesn't

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
for him so I'm hoping this doesn't

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.069 
for him so I'm hoping this doesn't
happen<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.370> Sin<00:02:23.549> Cara<00:02:23.730> I'm<00:02:24.360> hoping<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> same

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
happen to Sin Cara I'm hoping the same

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.630 
happen to Sin Cara I'm hoping the same
thing<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.409> happened<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.799> Sin<00:02:26.010> Cara<00:02:26.220> because

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
thing just happened to Sin Cara because

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.490 
thing just happened to Sin Cara because
same<00:02:26.879> car<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.329> my<00:02:27.480> opinion<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.170> great

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
same car and my opinion is a great

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.819 
same car and my opinion is a great
talent<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.599> once<00:02:30.599> again<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.110> depends<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.680> how

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
talent and once again it depends on how

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.550 
talent and once again it depends on how
WWE<00:02:32.190> wants<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.849> use<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.239> now<00:02:34.019> we<00:02:34.079> all<00:02:34.500> know

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
WWE wants to use it now we all know

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.589 
WWE wants to use it now we all know
because<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.280> his<00:02:35.459> size<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.030> don't<00:02:36.269> see<00:02:36.450> him

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
because of his size I don't see him

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.830 
because of his size I don't see him
being<00:02:36.629> world<00:02:37.079> champion<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.909> just<00:02:38.940> limits

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
being world champion so that just limits

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.660 
being world champion so that just limits
his<00:02:40.049> possibility<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.040> highest<00:02:41.430> he<00:02:41.519> can

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
his possibility the highest he can

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.199 
his possibility the highest he can
possibly<00:02:41.849> go<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.349> IC<00:02:43.799> title<00:02:44.069> or<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
possibly go with the IC title or you

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.300 
possibly go with the IC title or you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
opinion if I was booking Sin Cara I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.089

with sin cara you know he's a great

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.270 
with sin cara you know he's a great
wrestler<00:04:18.539> but<00:04:18.930> if<00:04:19.079> WWE<00:04:19.530> does<00:04:19.919> not<00:04:20.039> know<00:04:20.159> how<00:04:20.250> to

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
wrestler but if WWE does not know how to

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.110 
wrestler but if WWE does not know how to
use<00:04:20.400> him<00:04:20.840> he's<00:04:21.840> gonna<00:04:22.019> end<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.349> like<00:04:22.500> evolve

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
use him he's gonna end up like evolve

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.790 
use him he's gonna end up like evolve
eventually<00:04:24.120> hopefully<00:04:24.630> not

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
eventually hopefully not

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.150 
eventually hopefully not
but<00:04:26.800> um<00:04:27.010> how<00:04:27.970> would<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.210> booked<00:04:28.480> him<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:29.160> would

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
but um how would I booked him I would

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.440 
but um how would I booked him I would
love<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.970> see<00:04:31.300> sink<00:04:31.660> our<00:04:31.870> face<00:04:32.290> Rey<00:04:32.650> Mysterio

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
love to see sink our face Rey Mysterio

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.170 
love to see sink our face Rey Mysterio
they<00:04:34.450> would<00:04:34.630> have<00:04:34.900> an<00:04:35.170> amazing<00:04:35.770> feud<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:37.030> know

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
they would have an amazing feud you know

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.200 
they would have an amazing feud you know
I<00:04:37.420> think<00:04:38.320> easily<00:04:38.950> turn<00:04:39.280> Sin<00:04:39.520> Cara<00:04:39.700> heel

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
I think easily turn Sin Cara heel

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.270 
I think easily turn Sin Cara heel
against<00:04:40.600> Mysterio<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.290> vice<00:04:41.440> versa<00:04:41.710> I'll<00:04:41.920> turn

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
against Mysterio or vice versa I'll turn

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.660 
against Mysterio or vice versa I'll turn
right<00:04:42.640> here<00:04:42.850> get<00:04:43.120> sin<00:04:43.330> cara<00:04:43.690> but<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:45.490> would<00:04:45.640> be

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
right here get sin cara but it would be

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.940 
right here get sin cara but it would be
easier<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.330> bring<00:04:46.570> him<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.870> as<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.650> Gila

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
easier to bring him in as the Gila

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.450 
easier to bring him in as the Gila
counterpart<00:04:48.670> to<00:04:48.970> Rey<00:04:49.480> Mysterio<00:04:49.990> as<00:04:50.290> that<00:04:51.190> heel

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
counterpart to Rey Mysterio as that heel

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.730 
counterpart to Rey Mysterio as that heel
character<00:04:51.930> because<00:04:52.930> Rey<00:04:53.110> Mysterio<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.590> so

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
character because Rey Mysterio is so

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.410 
character because Rey Mysterio is so
popular<00:04:53.950> right<00:04:54.190> now<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.520> think<00:04:54.820> turning<00:04:55.150> him

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
popular right now I think turning him

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.330 
popular right now I think turning him
here<00:04:55.660> would<00:04:55.870> probably<00:04:56.080> not<00:04:56.860> be<00:04:56.890> a<00:04:57.040> good<00:04:57.220> idea

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
here would probably not be a good idea

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.970 
here would probably not be a good idea
then<00:04:58.000> again<00:04:58.150> I<00:04:58.600> take<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:58.990> back<00:04:59.050> because<00:04:59.500> this

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
then again I take that back because this

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.850 
then again I take that back because this
kid<00:05:00.160> made<00:05:00.340> her<00:05:00.520> leave<00:05:00.670> based<00:05:01.600> off<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.900> rumors

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
kid made her leave based off of rumors

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.860 
kid made her leave based off of rumors
going<00:05:03.100> around<00:05:03.670> of<00:05:04.060> course<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.540> over<00:05:04.780> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
going around of course on over the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.620 
going around of course on over the
internet<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:05.470> um<00:05:06.070> why<00:05:06.880> not<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:07.210> haven't<00:05:07.540> go

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
internet so um why not just haven't go

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.970 
internet so um why not just haven't go
as<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:07.930> heel<00:05:08.200> no<00:05:09.010> it's<00:05:09.310> just<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.550> thought<00:05:09.730> but<00:05:09.970> um

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
as a heel no it's just a thought but um

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.530 
as a heel no it's just a thought but um
that<00:05:11.980> aside<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.880> think<00:05:12.940> L<00:05:13.480> mystical<00:05:14.170> Sin<00:05:14.830> Cara

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
that aside I think L mystical Sin Cara

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.860 
that aside I think L mystical Sin Cara
