00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 and with people how are you I hope that 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 be fine this time we are in another 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.519
 informative video so of these that in 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 low form and then on this occasion as 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.179
 it's also a title the video is going 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.910
 trying in addition to a small review 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 I am going to give better to the list of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.460
 the update that has been released on 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.949
 today, February 10, 2015 and then 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 as you know makes a video 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.519
 previous created an arch that if the video 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.170
 previous had said that there were rumors 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.880
 about this possibility of 21 and then it's 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 made a reality of pretty soon from 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.140
 new rumors so it's going to start with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 the list that at least in xbox already 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 came out the update suppose it's 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 a tv 21 in quotation marks although here in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.480
 what are the minecraft forums because 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.520
 if you know 4j studies post what 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 what is the correction list 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 of errors that this is a matter of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.219
 correction of errors but 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 here I think he was wrong a little bit in 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 the post because in the post here 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.559
 mentions that they swooped on 11 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.239
 February 2015 although in at least 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.870
 in my console I do not know if in any of the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.300
 others has already been released on this day to 10 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.670
 February then well let's start 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.500
 with the list curiously the same list 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 error correction goes for both 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.120
 consoles for both xbox and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.590
 playstation is curious because in the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.020
 first time they throw a correction of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.820
 errors that go so much for a console 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.980
 as for another one because if you know 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.560
 the consoles as they are have some 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.600
 six exclusivities differences but in 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.310
 this time the mistakes are the same 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.170
 and also the correction are the same 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.360
 so let's start with the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.120
 small lists are you like with 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 update is always corrected always 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.190
 Redstone temitas always like you 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 they know those mechanisms that serve but 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 sometimes they do not lock and he talks about it 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.670
 this update have corrected more 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.650
 although they do not specify what but here 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.360
 he mentions that some are corrected 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.310
 also increased what has been the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.590
 main care limit if you are wagons 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 that we use in what is still a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.820
 world I think is the one that I think is what 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 maximum that we could put you trolley 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.470
 It will be 40 or so because I think it has 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210
 increased or that we hope but we go with 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.070
 the following has been corrected a small 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.200
 tree that we had full that when 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.580
 we took a horse and they were 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.400
 emotion area close these 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.319
 they disappeared like that with the armor or 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.920
 with what has been the chairs of 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.019
 ride or a tie or even name tag 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.209
 you can also disappear but with this 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.120
 little patch is not going to happen anymore or that 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.890
 let's wait while we're in an area 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.599
 near or far another curious thing that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 I had never realized and it was that 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.590
 when we want a map and for 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 At least I had not realized was 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 that when we created a map this as 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.620
 you know in the previous 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.470
 updates got what's coming 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.269
 being an empty map like that was called or 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.790
 they had nothing and just when the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.549
 crush let's go the lte out there this one 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.730
 updated and marked the area well where 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.739
 we were meeting but that was 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.829
 that was before now what has been 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.319
 the followers who had active 20 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.760
 this us when creating a map 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.930
 and it was already generated what is being 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.579
 what has been our world already 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.099
 was updated map and we 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.739
 marked the whole location around the world 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.120
 and that was a small saving since it 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.280
 assumes that a map should be generated 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.500
 empty then they have already corrected and now 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.389
 with us we want a map because 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.790
 we will generate an empty map has been 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.459
 corrected two problems one a little bit 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.560
 serious and the other irregular not the first 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.200
 and the most serious was when we 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.419
 we use a note block a notebook 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.000
 as you know him when 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.980
 we use massively or in large 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.949
 amount sometimes the game crash is already going or 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.239
 they were taking off immediately and that was 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:49.439
 a small problem as it could damage 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.030
 what is being what you notice 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.939
 that had our world even up 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.370
 some could disappear but errors 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.230
 that has minecraft and the second is that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.299
 the problem of the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.370
 generation of the villas in the worlds 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.829
 minecraft because sometimes sometimes 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.180
 some villas for example the villas 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.650
 where certain were in villas 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.000
 of prairie that yes it has been me to see it in 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.910
 some seeds that I've been 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.890
 investigating out there 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.110
 and they will correct and it would happen they are the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.060
 oddities of those constructions and good 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.400
 for me the lake is the most important thing that 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.280
 has this list is the next one that 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.010
 has corrected in the witches' huts 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.140
 the houses since there is supposed to be only 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.700
 they must plan witches more never others 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.220
 mobs that was what I had in my world 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.170
 your rival but now with this this patch 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.050
 it's not going to happen now it's just going to 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.000
 plan witches but you can get the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.970
 at which time 14 mob may seem 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.880
 but there's going to be more abundance witches and 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.580
 less more normal that was what I had 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.200
 my world but backwards I had more mobs and 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.820
 had less witches so with this 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.170
 update because it's not going to happen anymore and 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.850
 will be more effective the farm of 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.190
 witches another mistake that minecraft had 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.950
 was about the generation of worlds in what 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.840
 that is being black and is supposed 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.630
 that when we needed the 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.660
 black is supposed to be saved or 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.110
 must be generated in the same strength with 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.210
 the same chests and the same spinners 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.580
 of the blazers thing that would not be when 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.749
 because we wanted 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.389
 disappeared our partners was the 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:21.039
 structure yes but something that 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.559
 in itself I had to see it in a world that 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.209
 I had collapsed out there but if it touched me 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.599
 see it and also had quite a few chests 

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:30.429
 there chests generated naturally by 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.959
 the strength but not accepting it 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:34.749
 it was not there was no chest and 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:36.699
 either there was no Spanish of 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.619
 blazers and with this update you can 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.139
 know if you already see for that and the last 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.419
 What we have left in this list is that it 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.189
 social solved what is being 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:50.829
 the trip or the trip on main cards 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.989
 and going through portals because it's 

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:55.899
 I also had to see what when 

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:59.019
 well one of my adventures that when 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:00.819
 I wanted to clone but in fact I wanted to go up 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.399
 that clone video but it was already very 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.920
 used and generated but one of those me 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:08.860
 accidentally climbed 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.410
 the wagon because before it is native without 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.050
 natural snow I have 20 also when 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.780
 you wanted to clone you had to use this 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.310
 wagon so I do not know what and I got on 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.320
 accident because I did not know well how 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.210
 I put normal wagons in 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.790
 instead of wagons with a chest that was 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.740
 that was used and then I got me through 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.590
 to the portal and I could not get off anymore 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.940
 had been used the doll of 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.430
 minecraft and so it had been left 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.210
 fought good some other occasion this one 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.620
 it was the minecraft let's say in the 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.050
 level because we had already passed the 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.260
 portal but I could not remove it 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.150
 was there let's say and transparent be 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.220
 or I could not interact with him 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.410
 then it was a small mistake that I had 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.940
 this but they have already corrected it and 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.040
 Well I hope you liked it is 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.740
 this little list to this little review 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.840
 of all the changes they have had 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.460
 good all the arrangements he has had 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.260
 in minecraft with this update that 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.170
 they are quite and very important with 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.480
 shy of networks where of little things 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.790
 minecraft and blah blah blah no longer know in 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.990
 this update goes for more consoles 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.180
 playstation and xbox 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.090
 down in the links I'm going to leave the 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.530
 ready because they want to consult the and 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.060
 because nothing else I hope that they have 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.560
 liked the video if it was like that leave your 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.770

 people who share the videos for 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.340
 that more people find out about this than 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.170
 some may take you by surprise 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.330
 this update but well with this already 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.280
 there is not in that you write to the channel if you 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.680

 liked the video and see you later
