00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.949
 and good 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.719
 and people like are welcome to a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.209
 new textron video this time and this 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.520
 week we bring you another new video and 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.130
 another new game just like the week 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.350
 last we brought them what was sprint 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.530
 with island this time we bring you what 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.350
 it's smash hits game very funny very 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.760
 entertaining and sometimes stressful because 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.020
 yes I can say that if it is sometimes very 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.169
 Stressful 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.090
 This game consists of several levels in 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.840
 this moment and come to him until the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.510
 12 only then I do not keep my 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.400
 my departure regrettably since it changed 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.680
 of equipment there are many other things more 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.340
 in this part of here we can find 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 what is the sound options and the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.090
 graphics we can as you can see in the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.780
 background the graphics detail can 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.480
 change ok and we can see what is the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.180
 point of the game the credits with see your 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.760
 facebook your twitter your website or more 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.920
 games we even have a part 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 which is for 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.150
 the ranking of achievements that 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.610
 we have from what is google play 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 games for example you can see that here I 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.190
 I have only 37 percent 6 of 16 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 unlocked achievements 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.170
 and well, let's start, it's a game 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.810
 quite easy enough and what is 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.960
 it's just about hitting crystals 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.440
 with a metal ball let's say it here and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.870
 is pressed to launch fly and is to see 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.350
 we're going to turn up the volume so that 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.350
 I listened 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.100
 I'll be in every shot glass you're going to 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.700
 get three balls the crystals of 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 triangles 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.290
 can you see here if we hit 10 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.600
 crystals followed we get a ball 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.490
 double 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 and then there are our double balls 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.159
 equally if we hit a crystal that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.920
 it's not the one of obstacles we lose 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.110
 10 balls 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.520
 if that ball was heard half average 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.130
 weird but that 's how it works to hit 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.050
 that equally if we lose a ball is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.090
 say if we do not make a streak followed by 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.360
 balls and we do not give to all 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.940
 which we can get to see or are 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.800
 near us we are going to lose our 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.600
 streak of balls and therefore we are going to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.170
 return to have here only one ball 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.760
 as you can see on the top 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.050
 we have there as many balls as there are balls 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.400
 we have left how many we are winning or 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.520
 how many have we lost 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.320
 hi are 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.070
 it's a pretty pretty game 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.210
 Entertaining as I tell you very 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.290
 intuitive very easy to use 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.450
 and that in addition to that we have other 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.570
 several powers in this case as they can 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.420
 see I already have five balls the combo of 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.470
 five balls I already have it is let 's say the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 maximum that we can get to have 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.800
 we have passed the first level we will see 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.800
 how are we doing in the second 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.750
 as you can see it 's a bit slow since 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.770
 the graphics I put them in high quality 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.670
 let's see if we can put my god 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.640
 I think that I already reguÃ© them to put you in 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.520
 average quality and we keep playing good 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.740
 at least 195 balls 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.110
 whether it's a little bit faster and you 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.120
 gives this surrender more quickly since 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.530
 as I'm recording musicians are a bit 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.770
 or a lot of the system 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.160
 and to buy it they are not very very graphics 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.620
 very large but if they are, let's say, 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.700
 intermediate quality then if it is 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.620
 necessary some kind of rendering the 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.720
 as part of the system and making them 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.930
 double because I'm recording if it's a 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:09.810
 slightly lower the level of speed 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.630
 in the game this is the game of smash 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.650
 hits is totally free on the play 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.170
 store 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.170
 with a premium version 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.450
 which allows us to advance from the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.000
 level at which we stay is to say 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.310
 they could see the advance from level 1 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.030
 since then I put a pause to modify 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.820
 the graphics 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.050
 but if we were not there if I did not have what 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.139
 which is the premium version 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.250
 I would have to start again from the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.680
 level 0 this is done a little bit 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.690
 bad because then let's say we're in 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.050
 level 7 or 6 and we're going to lose the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.050
 balls 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.180
 we lose the game when we reach zero 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.280
 balls we lose the game 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.690
 the speed is also increasing 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.139
 the obstacles are becoming more 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.139
 big 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.370
 so 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.350
 when we get to zero we lose not only the 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.080
 only the balls but also the game 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.640
 then in the premium version we have 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:27.480
 what is access and access to what 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.050
 is to be able to continue playing from the level 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.050
 in which we stay 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.129
 to be able to continue that yes we can 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.490
 get more balls the balls that 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:41.940
 we have the only ones we will be 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.940
 technically 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:49.140
 so if it's a bit difficult this 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.530
 game is more than anything like saying your 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:56.760
 agility of reflections since we have to 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.760
 do several things at the same time 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.860
 how can you see if it's a little bit is 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.110
 pretty entertaining 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.120
 but if it becomes a bit annoying in 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.160
 certain moments since there are obstacles 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.030
 that you do not see 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.130
 balls that you lose or things like that 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.000
 style so well folks I hope 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:24.020
