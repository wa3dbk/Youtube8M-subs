00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
 hello how are you today I love you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.210
 teach quickly how to build this 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:14.019
 aesthetic this basis that allows me to have 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.999
 a stable image using the pro make 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.599
 it's very simple what I did was buy 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:22.990
 a stretch of 3 meters of pvc this like 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:26.680
 You will see it is coated only 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.690
 material of foami and this measures it 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.280
 approximately 180 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.220
 comes already open, detached with medium if 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.720
 you want 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.740
 the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.290
 each arm of this base measures 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.880
 about a meter and what I did 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.610
 It was 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.200
 use 2 meters are reaching 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.750
 our shoulders and 2 of 45 centimeters 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:01.570
 that would be this part of here for the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.210
 handles or for the wings 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.580
 what I'm going to do is one time 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.180
 and I explain quickly how it works 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.090
 what I did was to reuse the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.010
 base that comes with the camera is 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.650
 important sometimes we do not know what to do 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.840
 with her 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.900
 I think that I use the accessories that 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.620
 they sell us not always necessary 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.910
 buy them all 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:33.050
 unless really men or that 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.990
 I really do not find the way to power 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.510
 reuse them the idea is very simple in 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.960
 the part of the medium that is sustained 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.740
 by two 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 everyone 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's in the middle part of this 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.100
 full of pvc 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.180
 and what I did was drill two holes 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.450
 what allows me now is to fix the base 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.840
 apart from here 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.319
 and allow the external base 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.650
 fixed in the position that 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.230
 I occupy 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.970
 what I did was the first 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.670
 and put all this together 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.520
 after the disarmament and the two holes that 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.360
 I did in this part of here 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.750
 practically 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.750
 yes 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.720
 the necessary measure 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.720
 take so many measures 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.870
 at what height you have to cut and this 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.580
 determines the base in the bed 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 so 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.500
 finally you can fix it 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.170
 between the screws 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.970
 the other 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.130
 and here I have 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.560
 and if necessary you can put it cause 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.800
 again to another organ 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.680
 so that the base is completely 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.630
 he fixes his body 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.650
 up there the clear base 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.010
 this is the idea that you have used in the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.010
 shoulders 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.350
 this is um and it is only 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.930
 not because it is much is very light 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.930
 but it's more than giving it a touch 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:23.750
 elegance or a visual touch product 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:27.620
 professional this is the idea 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:32.800
 when you're recording so 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.800
 fix and you can move 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.340
 from left to right 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.240
 a little more 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.060
 stable the image 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.160
 I thought this was an interesting idea 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.099
 tutorial I found on the internet too 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.599
 and then I really wanted to share them 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:55.039
 it is very simple how to do it and how 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:05:00.819
 carry it out in this project I 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.819
 I spent approximately 115 pesos 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.240
 a cheap this 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.350
 and done it gives you the option to like 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.710
 it's not stuck I'm not doing 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.210
 glue on either end on the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.750
 unions 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.569
 and the most important thing is that it allows you 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.880
 disarm it piece by piece depending 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.690
 of the size in which it is to transport 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.840
 even to be a suitcase the part of 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.840
 behind 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.760
 for me it's okay maybe I cut him 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:42.880
 15 10 centimeters at the end 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.540
 and you can basically do the base the 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.790
 base 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.980
 that I would be occupying for a next 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.040
 event 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:55.690
 I'll put them in the following link 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.200
 as you see already using it is actually 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.200
 very practical 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.780
 that's how they look 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.900
 and I'm going to upload a video 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.180
 the next video in which you are going to 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.930
 watch 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:17.590
 how using this aesthetic or was it 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.870
 allows us to eliminate completely 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.150
 the vibrations of the image when not 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:27.270
 he walks and moves because he is 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.260
 held the camera like for example ok 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:34.250
 what you liked we joined 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:39.380
 a very simple project cost me 115 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:43.759
 weights and assemble what you 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.759
 maybe 30 minutes
