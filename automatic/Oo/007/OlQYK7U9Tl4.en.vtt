00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.660
 so my name and jacqueline lagacÃ© gbh 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.869
 home empires and studies 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.510
 postdoctoral positions in oenology and 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.670
 bacteriological I was a professor at 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.689
 the Montreal unit where I led a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.820
 research laboratory for 17 years 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 if I'm interested in food 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.029
 mortgage know it's because I have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 suffered in a rather important way 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.859
 osteoarthritis and especially arthritis 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.859
 rheumatoid 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.580
 so people who suffer from 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.200
 chronic inflammation diseases would have 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.790
 interest in following their religion but 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.670
 potentially anti inflammatory 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.030
 because it has been shown by the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.660
 doctor seignalet that it was possible 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.239
 to put in remission 91 disease 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.280
 of chronic inflammation with a 12th 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.600
 average success of 80% 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.700
 no medicine to date is coming 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.820
 such results 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.290
 since the publication of my book 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.240
 why I could have how I'm going 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.380
 more pain and inflammation reborn 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.350
 by food 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 published in May 2011 and I have received 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.440
 hundreds of testimonials verbally and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.810
 also writing on my blog that asks 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.420
 that this diet is of a 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.700
 surprising efficiency to put in 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.800
 remission of many diseases 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.170
 to name a few 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.470
 osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.190
 fibromyalgia type 2 diabetes 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.380
 migraine beds diseases orl 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.310
 chronic that skin diseases like 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 eczema psoriasis 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.910
 since the death of Dr. Seignalet re 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.140
 2003, many works have made it possible 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.270
 demonstrate why and how 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.550
 protein leather proteins 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.090
 animals at high temperature 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.090
 the presence of gluten and acrylamide 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.810
 in cereals wheat and the fact of 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.950
 consume dairy products 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.170
 to potentiate the development of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.850
 diseases of chronic inflammation in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.250
 people who own 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.640
 genetic predispositions for these 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.640
 diseases 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.660
 I think he is really very 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.220
 interesting for people who 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.430
 suffer from inflammation diseases 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.260
 chronic to adopt a diet 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.740
 anti inflammatory the toxic diet 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:49.290
 because it's a way of 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.180
 to answer whose health 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.020
 I think people in this sense there 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.940
 have difficulty changing a 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.770
 Past feeding is obvious that for 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.960
 follow the mortgage regime sic 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.570
 changes need to be made 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.640
 important to its diet and one 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.070
 knows that the habits is the one to 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.720
 change and habits that concerns 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.870
 food are all the more 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.870
 difficult 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.520
 people who suffer from diseases 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.430
 of chronic inflammation have everything 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.640
 interest in subscribing to the menu of sos 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.940
 cooking because it gives them 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:36.070
 the opportunity to have daily support 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:40.120
 to feed yourself by making sure you have 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.830
 a balanced and varied diet and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.200
 physios who has no deficiency 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.820
 to be the idea by daily menus 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.180
 adapted it allows people who follow 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.880
 these diets do not break their heads 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.300
 to try to avoid foods that are 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.820
 confirmed pros right to a subscription and 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.370
 his zen spirit costs less than 10 dollars 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:12.220
 per month and it's based on the special 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.820
 in grocery stores every week so at 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.480
 that time the cost of the subscription 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:23.400
 disappears I would like to insist on the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.640
 I'm very proud to collaborate 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.500
 with the kitchen sos team because 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.420
 we are not only they do 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.210
 shows a professionalism really 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.630
 important but also they are very 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.540
 creative and I find they are 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.560
 she asks for a job 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.690
 the hard work 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.690
 and to produce results 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.690
 exceptional
