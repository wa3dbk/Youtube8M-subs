00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 william d 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.350
 almeria 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.780
 good welcome to today's show 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 we have the presentation of nba 2k 15 in 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.040
 madrid with tony to you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.990
 and is that the pod had me in which 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.550
 we have a trap 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 i am alive 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.889
 here 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.539
 United States to a new video in this 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.129
 case is good that I will tell you about 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.350
 that you have not read and that you have not 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.180
 seen already in mid to 15 then my 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.340
 impression and my feelings for the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.110
 game is clear that they have sent for today 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.970
 is unrivaled as a simulator is a 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.010
 absolute truth and that nobody can deny 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.570
 saying this can happen two things will 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.860
 can give two situations one that is 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.540
 comfortable and get more out 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 and benefits of your franchise as has 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.830
 made many and with a much less cost 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.270
 of production and more benefits or follow 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.670
 investing time and increasing more the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.260
 distance with your competitors in this 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.410
 case is your competitor who is paying 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.870
 those years of stopping is not like that nba live yes 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.700
 I'm paying good, I think with nba 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.350
 2k we are in the second case then already in 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.580
 2011 when they were left alone at 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.700
 front of the basketball simulators 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 They decided to take a lot of pasta and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.600
 invest a lot in their game and in putting 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.030
 jordan on the cover and jordan mode this 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.920
 so live your own revive the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.320
 moments of jordan just as the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.160
 that it was not easy and that is because 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.420
 that year both in 2011 the 12 13 and 14 them 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.220
 it would have been enough to take the game to 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 sell it because they had not competed and did not 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.130
 they had a competitor but they gave 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.080
 several steps further and they gave you 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.000
 Real reasons to buy the game 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.820
 growing every year year and good for 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.470
 many have been these leave eight of 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.920
 those of the first batch of playstation 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.690
 4 and xbox one of the only ones that seemed 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.519
 really knicks james that really got 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.270
 I saw a great graphic difference and 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.460
 what 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.590
 in spectacular in console has been of 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.820
 the few and now that what is going to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.580
 do two here to improve a product 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.530
 that already appears round that you can 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.420
 put to make it a must buy 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.310
 Well, that's what I'm going to tell you now 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.780
 I'm not going to talk about what it is and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.670
 graphically it 's better since it was very 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.840
 butt in 214 in I'm not going to say either 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.670
 too much at the playable level since 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.930
 we know we already know that since you jump 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.660
 my way of seeing is the one that better 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.830
 represents basketball as such and for 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.540
 Of course I will not talk about the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.640
 well-known comments in 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.520
 Spanish and of unsurpassed quality with more 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.600
 of 38 additional us this year I'm not going 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.430
 to talk about that although good 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.770
 technically I already told you about that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.810
 but anyway we already knew and we did not 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.790
 surprise that they maintain the level we do not 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.410
 It's surprising because you have to keep the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.080
 level to see what is going to see what has 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.460
 Last here we will finish 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.260
 to start the most popular mode of 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.400
 all my player mode has been redone and 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.620
 you have the opportunity to take you 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.290
 same or a francis anybody about 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 playoffs or win the nba or win the invi 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.030
 and what you want but this time 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.560
 attention you can scan your own face 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.570
 with the playstation that amaral with kinect 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.310
 and make you what you are in the game but 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.070
 do not scan in flat plan photo photo photo 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.680
 do not scan in plan 3d in plan pro in 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.350
 plan how they scan kevin last or what 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.360
 let it be dwight howard to be equal 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.640
 identical look at how good they have been 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.370
 reproduced to mesut özil tories reunited 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.020
 here is not an issue yes forgiveness is that it 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.550
 They differ so much that then there 's 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.560
 my team that we already know but we can 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.840
 join magic with jordan with lebron with 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.580
 pau with three rhombus terms but what 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.020
 good button because for me it is fixed 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.790
 because there was that zbik there is also 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.050
 dikembe mutombo let's say it's a 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.970
 kind of variant of the last and tim to 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.970
 both here with challenges in scenarios 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.709
 very vásquez situations let's say and for 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.740
 last a novelty that I want to emphasize 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.390
 quite and it's on nba 2k tv that is another 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.070
 of those developments that will include in 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.930
 2k 15 and it is a television show 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.070
 real inside the video game what no longer 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.230
 it's like what the hostess is 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.950
 rachel but with little spoken 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.349
 of basketball 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.640
 news on websites in newspapers in 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.989
 sports programs I think it's a 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.250
 great advantage to watch videos and 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.200
 summaries of the best of the day 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.120
 interviews with players interviews 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.280
 coaches content video much 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.480
 of level 2 as of the nba itself I think 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.700
 which is a very good contribution and I 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.340
 leads to the following reflection attention 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.870
 to friends to attention I think how nice 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.190
 of this is that 2k is worrying 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.120
 more for basketball in Spain than 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.950
 what does any means of 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.800
 communication or minister or whatever 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.900
 because pretty good and sad at the same time not 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.150
 doing I think it's making the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.950
 beige basketball fan in Spain 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.250
 a different way because the players 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.200
 the nba 2k players as the game is 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.240
 very cool as they get excited and play a lot and 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.710
 suddenly they are interested in that is 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.139
 what teams in real life both of 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.020
 nba teams and now those who have 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.820
 Euroleague and acb are some 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.860
 I think it's very interesting and I am a 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.600
 example of that because to me nba 2k in 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.310
 hopping made me love the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.030
 basketball through then see the 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.130
 own game 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.260
 iverson that was the monda and suddenly 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.630
 I started to get interested in 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.460
 the real game and see him in real life 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.200
 let's say no, I think it's a 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.580
 proof that they care about 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.620
 Spain as 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.870
 basketball consumer so much is that way 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.759
 that I believe that the one that comes roy jones 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.379
 every year to present the game here to 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.629
 madrid I think I think it 's a test 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:32.250
 pretty good also here the man 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.250
 of this message only for Spain 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.770
 Y 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.150
 sources 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 d 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.319
 nothing else 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.210
 there is that it is achilles that is for 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.560
 really want him good there is one thing 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.599
 that seems imperative and that people to 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.129
 the best does not realize but two that 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.409
 could perfectly draw the game in 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.360
 English and would sell more or less the same 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.969
 I think it's not I do not know if it makes up for them 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.159
 autonomously in the investment that 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.409
 gives money and time to put the 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.050
 comments in Spanish and add each 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:24.449
 every year then thousands and thousands of lines of 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.129
 dialogue and comments for for the 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.960
 game that seems like I do not 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.330
 we value but I think it's a sign of 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.370
 that value the Spanish market as such 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.750
 as a basketball consumer and I eat 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.969
 fond of this sport and how 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.819
 digital basketball consumer and I have 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.650
 unreal really appreciate it so 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.699
 I guess that well, thank you and sure 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.949
 that you some of you 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.020
 fans of this sport also what 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.430
 thanks is good to make clear that 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.289
 this video is not sponsored or by 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.689

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:53.129
 anthony davis neither by tosca nor by anyone 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.960
 simply an opinion and something that 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.759
 I wanted to tell and wanted it 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.770
 take advantage of which positions I count the 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.969
 news make my opinion clear 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.050
 auditorium if you can follow me on 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.529
 twitter on facebook and you can follow me 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.529
 down the street 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.370
 finally that hunger peace I go to 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.820
 painted asshole and not very bounded 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.820
 a bee
