00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello to all today I have some 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.780
 very nice thing to you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.810
 to propose 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.660
 it's about fusing into minecraft or 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.920
 then to levitate balls of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 snow I will call you that as you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 then I want to do it right now 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.699
 demonstration game launched this ball of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 snow you can see she's going all 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.939
 right or she goes up a little bit 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.560
 so I removed the sound and lte and for 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 to prevent it from driving you crazy 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.949
 along this video you see our 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.359
 snowball before seeing the ol goes up 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.829
 a little bit she has to go up a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.350
 block all to 20-30 blocks the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.870
 jelly I killed to avoid having 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 live on the other hand if we leave our 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.410
 work but charles down it happens 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.480
 something very interesting she 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 Remain overall levitation bottom you 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 see there she goes up a little bit 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.270
 depends on the times sometimes it goes up 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.340
 not sometimes they move a little and we 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.610
 can kill sion in principle a strike 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.280
 long enough he can kill our ball 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.100
 of snow 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 very funny for the video here it is 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.780
 I looked for the cus because she has a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.130
 point of a number of life points his 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.110
 people like that and and that's it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.320
 you see there I did some small 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.810
 damage if launched globally flush 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.659
 ground 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.009
 cros a big slice is in the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.280
 it is not necessarily very recommended 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.710
 because it causes some lags then 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.630
 the system is relatively simple it is 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.200
 even a single blog orders I you 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.750
 would put the order in the description 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 here we have our usual lodge all this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.679
 it's nothing it's another system 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.229
 in fact there is a command that 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.369
 account and inside I have you 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.950
 would recommend it description of 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.429
 way you have it running on the ball 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.289
 of snow 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.470
 we make it appear tmt 7 blocks 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.190
 below then 7 blocks and where is it 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.979
 just for her to go rate 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.420
 relatively straight and if we change the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.189
 value for example they say to put that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.360
 six blocks below it will happen 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.369
 something very interesting 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.920
 snowball launch section saw 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.299
 it rises in less height and if 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 the more we will reduce the gap between 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.599
 the appearance of the TNT and the ball of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.489
 snow anymore she'll go up fast 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.790
 but here in principle it could go up 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.970
 really booming see enough 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.240
 nice 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.240
 and of course she stops at the diaper 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.960
 256 if I'm not wrong and she stops 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.160
 finally two children of junk sterk in 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.270
 reading are no longer his rages and she 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 stop that's why our 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.080
 trench stopped here but in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.430
 principle if we have it if we run it and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.420
 then we get closer to her should 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.950
 continue normally 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.600
 and that's because I'm too 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.090
 surely know finally I'm not even 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.320
 sure to know about a solo map but if 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.760
 you are a server there are many more 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.440
 of chung who are loaded and suddenly 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.060
 it's even more interesting 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.370
 that's all for this video 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.900
 I hope you enjoyed it if you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.970
 have an idea something to me 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.570
 propose do not hesitate to leave a 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.400
 little comment 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.400
 thank you for watching over
