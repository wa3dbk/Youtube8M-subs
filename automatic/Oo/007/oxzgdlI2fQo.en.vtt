00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hello dear subscribers and all those 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.610
 who stumbled upon this video and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.730
 that's just for those who are with me at all 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.500
 don't let me introduce myself 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.259
 sadalexa player with steadily yellow 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.320
 Become an avid artovod constantly in 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.439
 burst from this here nikakuschaya 100 here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 lt approach is about to but in spite of all my 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.600
 little yellow regalia there are things in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.190
 the game that pisses me off 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 so today I am opening a new rubric 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.769
 garden lay on the views and today I will touch 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.559
 the topic of open cards is how people approach them 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.199
 are everywhere heard that in the open 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.780
 cards well, it's just impossible to play everything 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.719
 stand in the bushes steering wheel and there pt and art 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 no btra and other different rubbish 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 and the most interesting is what way 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 games are chosen by these people 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 that is, if art and pt stand bushes and not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.210
 glows on prokhorovke means we, too 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 we will stand in the bushes and whine and that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.120
 it became impossible to play potatoes go 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.880
 see 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.790
 and all that oh, these are always eternally upset 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 vulnerable natures are shorter showing you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.329
 examples of how cool to play 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.810
 prokhorovke and so here's the first pain I'm at 30 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.350
 double top fight without art iz kobochka 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 tell you before or but many even in such 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.969
 they manage to find a situation for themselves 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.000
 bush or stand on the mountain until blue 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.420
 always used to go uphill too 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.490
 then I realized that it was very long and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.829
 it happens that you are for a few minutes or 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.649
 even on the floor of the battle you turn off absolutely 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.439
 shorter from it I go to the center to counter 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.530
 fireflies tank alley and at the same time and 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.840
 highlight with me my pt sovzvodny 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.329
 whose help I expect and how 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.549
 It turned out not in vain what is the result of all these 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.270
 action performed personal combat 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.070
 the task of tanking vigorous battle 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.829
 a wonderful 30 deuce that can 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.649
 in tanking and in their color accuracy and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.399
 let alpha not royal but alpha for 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.399
 wimps at all 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.530
 fight 2 i am on side 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.230
 and do absolutely the same thing in this fight 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.570
 sovzvodnyh no shoot alley anyone 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.480
 but stand in the bushes or climb the mountain 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.480
 so that the sniper and there the thread is not somehow 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.150
 did not want tactics somewhere to be thrust on 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.210
 Sidisi usually does not roll but here 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.580
 more or less lucky family had 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.440
 the floor of the battle poke allied tanks so that they 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.470
 have advanced a bit on this 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.860
 very alley but in the end yes poked all 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.110
 went well although weakly intelligent and yes I 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.000
 never look at my damage because 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.400
 that my understanding is there are many others 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.610
 indicators in the battle that can lead 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.300
 team to victory but it is the most 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.430
 the main third case I have not mine 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.180
 clan members on a three-legged streamer 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.190
 decided to rush in the village and received from the art 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.770
 shine your dummies but still 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.290
 moving forward getting into the board from 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.630
 sevens on the center which was completely superfluous 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 in short, we got on all pc 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.570
 dead but made a rustle which I think 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.250
 led the team to victory 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.280
 imagine if they were supported 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.680
 allied tanks in general this case as 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.410
 reminds me of a sensational story of the face 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.760
 you august by grief from flash only 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.200
 instead of a mountain alley 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.360
 and instead of mouse, yaga extras go crazy 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.150
 mediocre plums but maybe they donâ€™t 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.810
 Artoo whine about the bush and the state Fu Fu Fu 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.810
 so do 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.200
 his case number 4 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.440
 art prevents live prokhorovka to prevent 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.530
 and I prefer to try their 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.709
 and her happiness on the center and see who 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.440
 lucky today if lucky her like this 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.530
 case, I never cease to hope that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.500
 my allies understand its essence 40 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.620
 second codes and that is quite possible 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.729
 they are able to thank the distractions 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.010
 attention tank and go ahead yes it's not 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.919
 always works and by no means 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:33.190
 justify my zero in the damage graph 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:36.729
 it's just that it's better for me so here's the case 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.280
 5 in my opinion the most significant in 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.300
 general to be sure that the allies 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.910
 you will be supported 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.030
 do not believe you can gather a platoon and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.010
 somehow we decided to play outside the box 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.400
 upper spawn to go longer without 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.280
 sides of the roller coaster wait until st light 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.620
 mount and move forward four arts 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.039
 because you can't stand 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.470
 give her a shot here i am most likely 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.139
 I make the mistake of shooting fireflies from 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.539
 shining getting the drum from 50 b but 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.639
 not much upset the pipe wrenches 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.970
 whole and stand yourself calm not 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.090
 will meet have time to tank in and z120 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.669
 which is on the mountain is soon lit IS-7 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.320
 and also sent to the shed with the help of 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.320
 do not believe our mouths 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.729
 but all here we decide to go ahead 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.430
 pick up lorca on the mountain smearing at 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.090
 this damage and distracting our enemies from 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.090
 tanks on the mountain 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.240
 soon the art begins to discharge into me 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.320
 but it does not matter because we are to her 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.120
 very close and soon she will play in 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.510
 eventually we find this invulnerable threat 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.919
 we light it up and the whole battle is won quickly 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.830
 and boldly conclude I want to say that art 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.080
 except that she allegedly spoils the BTR 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.630
 also makes the game look new 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.120
 group aggressive attack methods 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.389
 that will help neutralize and and quickly and 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.430
 with less losses and very sad that 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.430
 basically everyone is not able to play on 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.310
 support team make it difficult for many 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.470
 very good it was a trial 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.690
 Lay on opinions and subscribe if 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.220
 she is interesting to you 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.919
 planning often mutil stream so 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.039
 that join I will be glad all bye 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.039
 until
