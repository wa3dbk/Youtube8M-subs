00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.330 
and we have to dress in we started
looking<00:03:33.209> into<00:03:33.420> what<00:03:33.810> happens<00:03:34.230> with<00:03:34.470> fabrics

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
looking into what happens with fabrics

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
looking into what happens with fabrics
and<00:03:35.490> out<00:03:35.550> fabrics<00:03:35.910> are<00:03:36.030> finished

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
and out fabrics are finished

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.510 
and out fabrics are finished
traditionally<00:03:36.959> we<00:03:37.620> chose<00:03:37.830> organic<00:03:38.310> on

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
traditionally we chose organic on

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.280 
traditionally we chose organic on
because<00:03:39.000> organic<00:03:39.330> cotton<00:03:39.810> isn't<00:03:40.080> finished

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
because organic cotton isn't finished

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.410 
because organic cotton isn't finished
with<00:03:40.530> formaldehyde<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.370> other<00:03:41.820> finishing

with formaldehyde and other finishing

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.320 
with formaldehyde and other finishing
chemicals<00:03:42.959> which<00:03:43.530> we<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.920> call<00:03:44.730> us<00:03:44.880> crazy<00:03:45.030> we

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
chemicals which we just call us crazy we

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.820 
chemicals which we just call us crazy we
don't<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.750> would<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:45.990> safe<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.410> our<00:03:46.470> son's
