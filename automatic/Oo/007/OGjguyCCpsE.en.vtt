00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 all right 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hi, I'm Pablo, and I'm dedicated to 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.530
 carving of stamps in manual 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.089
 does not rule out working with your hands and 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.480
 everything we can do in a way 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.740
 craft give us the imagination the power 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.000
 I love everything that has to do 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.460
 relate to nature by the 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.439
 composition by colors and 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.510
 beauty use the geometry that 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.759
 we find in many places 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.109
 I have worked with different artists 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.060
 from those who create more 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.529
 artisanal like me up to those who 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.090
 they move away from this world but they want to give 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.980
 a more personal and artisanal touch to your 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 work on constant factors in 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.329
 clothing stores brands 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.850
 we can stamp anything that is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 happen to us we can start from the most 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.900
 singles working with paper that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.150
 covering posters photographs albums of 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.890
 photos and spending a little more looking with 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.780
 other inks for textile printing 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.580
 share your own clothes stamping on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.580
 walls anything you can think of 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.579
 in our domestic course we 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.140
 we enter directly into the world of 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.700
 manual stamping and carving 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.409
 stamps to hands the goal we want 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.090
 our own collection of stamps more 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.619
 later we compare them on paper creating 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.220
 our poster although we can 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.080
 use them in different colors outside 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.330
 fears here you do not have to be an expert 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.740
 with the pencil or know how to draw and neither 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.550
 it's a lot of use of technologies and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.020
 computers will start from scratch we're going 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.460
 to teach some tools so that 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.240
 we can do this technique with the most 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 small of the house 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.869
 at the beginning you will know my work 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.759
 you will know the world of stamps and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.649
 stamping and then we will take a walk 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.970
 by the referents influence that I have 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.649
 I would also like to teach the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.330
 basic tools that we will need and 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.950
 other more specific tools for 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.450
 other courses I want to teach the law of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.190
 positive and the negative that is where else 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.990
 we will have doubts and then we will do 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.700
 detailed we will know the strokes and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.600
 we will enter fully into the rubber 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.460
 once we have our stamp 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.520
 we will do the application of it in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.900
 different surfaces like fabric and paper 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 to complete this course we will need 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.210
 pencil gum inks our gouge with 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.340
 five points the rubber where we will perform 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.420
 our stamp and a handful of books that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.420
 they serve you as a reference 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.550
 this course is aimed at designers 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 illustrators who want to move away a 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.360
 little of the screen and the mouse that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.950
 love things made by hand those who 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.690

 mind associated with something tiny 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.140
 related to postal items that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.670
