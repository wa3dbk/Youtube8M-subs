00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
so what I'm going to do is a quick

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.240 
so what I'm going to do is a quick
overview<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.960> just<00:00:06.960> model<00:00:07.290> car<00:00:07.559> collecting<00:00:08.099> in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
overview of just model car collecting in

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.970 
overview of just model car collecting in
general<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:09.240> prices<00:00:09.630> brands<00:00:11.030> quality<00:00:12.030> issues

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
general so prices brands quality issues

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.279 
general so prices brands quality issues
all<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.610> stuff<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:16.430> let's<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:17.580> started<00:00:17.970> you

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
all that stuff so let's get started you

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.620 
all that stuff so let's get started you
have<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.589> basic<00:00:20.550> types<00:00:20.730> models<00:00:21.329> you<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.509> a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
have two basic types models you have a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.239 
have two basic types models you have a
bunch<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.019> different<00:00:22.199> scales<00:00:22.589> some<00:00:23.009> range

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.249 
bunch of different scales some range

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.279 
bunch of different scales some range
from<00:00:24.079> 112<00:00:25.579> 112<00:00:26.579> scale<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.659> is<00:00:27.689> 12<00:00:28.199> times

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
from 112 112 scale which is 12 times

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.669 
from 112 112 scale which is 12 times
smaller<00:00:29.249> than<00:00:29.399> the<00:00:29.669> than<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.499> actual<00:00:31.499> size

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
smaller than the than the actual size

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
smaller than the than the actual size
car<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.940> 18<00:00:33.540> scale<00:00:33.870> which<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
car then you have 18 scale which is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.830 
car then you have 18 scale which is
these<00:00:35.220> ones<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.789> collect<00:00:36.180> mostly<00:00:36.539> 18

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
these ones that I collect mostly 18

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.560 
these ones that I collect mostly 18
scale<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:38.100> most<00:00:38.309> abundant<00:00:38.570> then

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
scale because of the most abundant then

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.130 
scale because of the most abundant then
you<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.780> twenty-fourth<00:00:40.289> scale<00:00:40.699> 27<00:00:41.699> 28<00:00:42.269> you

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you have twenty-fourth scale 27 28 you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.069 
you have twenty-fourth scale 27 28 you
get<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> way<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.039> one<00:00:44.750> 64th<00:00:45.750> I've

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
get all the way down to one 64th I've

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.849 
get all the way down to one 64th I've
seen<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.940> sometimes<00:00:47.940> even<00:00:48.739> smaller<00:00:49.739> than

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
seen and sometimes even smaller than

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.720 
seen and sometimes even smaller than
that<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.420> anyway<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> difference

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that but anyway so the difference

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
that but anyway so the difference
between<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.000> scale<00:00:54.420> 118<00:00:54.839> and<00:00:55.109> 124<00:00:55.859> which<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
between a scale 118 and 124 which is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.579 
between a scale 118 and 124 which is
most<00:00:56.370> abundant<00:00:56.929> definitely<00:00:57.929> between<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> two

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
most abundant definitely between the two

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.290 
most abundant definitely between the two
this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> 1<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.249> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.429> 124<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.120> here

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this is a 1 this is a 124 right here

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.829 
this is a 1 this is a 124 right here
this<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> 118<00:01:01.999> so<00:01:02.999> you<00:01:03.089> can<00:01:03.269> pretty<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.510> see

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
this is a 118 so you can pretty much see

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.930 
this is a 118 so you can pretty much see
the<00:01:04.260> size<00:01:04.500> difference<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.339> definitely<00:01:05.730> if

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
the size difference and definitely if

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.310 
the size difference and definitely if
you're<00:01:06.090> planning<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.540> collecting<00:01:06.690> models<00:01:07.230> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
you're planning on collecting models I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
you're planning on collecting models I
would<00:01:07.440> suggest<00:01:07.560> mindful<00:01:08.190> 118<00:01:08.580> they're<00:01:09.540> more

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
would suggest mindful 118 they're more

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.430 
would suggest mindful 118 they're more
realistic<00:01:10.100> everything<00:01:11.100> opens<00:01:11.430> normally<00:01:12.440> some

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
realistic everything opens normally some

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.750 
realistic everything opens normally some
are<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.250> different<00:01:14.490> because

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
are some are a little different because

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.720 
are some are a little different because
they<00:01:14.910> don't<00:01:15.120> but<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:17.070> generally<00:01:17.460> good

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
they don't but and the generally good

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.150 
they don't but and the generally good
price<00:01:18.090> see<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.350> hatchback<00:01:19.680> doesn't

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
price see this one the hatchback doesn't

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.530 
price see this one the hatchback doesn't
open<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:21.350> go<00:01:23.060> size<00:01:24.060> difference

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
open in the back go size difference

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.500 
open in the back go size difference
there<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.800> 5<00:01:25.980> inches<00:01:26.370> and<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:30.330> is

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
there that's out of 5 inches and that is

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.410 
there that's out of 5 inches and that is
about<00:01:30.810> 7<00:01:31.470> inches<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.800> this<00:01:32.010> is<00:01:32.220> 18<00:01:33.180> times

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
about 7 inches so this is 18 times

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.570 
about 7 inches so this is 18 times
smaller<00:01:33.780> than<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.020> actual<00:01:34.410> car<00:01:34.590> every<00:01:35.280> single

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
smaller than the actual car every single

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.490 
smaller than the actual car every single
piece<00:01:35.730> but<00:01:37.580> then<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.940> some<00:01:39.300> now<00:01:40.230> this<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
piece but then you have some now this is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
piece but then you have some now this is
still<00:01:40.680> called<00:01:40.950> 1:24<00:01:41.640> scale<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.570> it's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
still called 1:24 scale but it's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
still called 1:24 scale but it's
actually<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:44.240> 120<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.550> while<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.150> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
actually a 120 it's a while this is a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.230 
actually a 120 it's a while this is a
131<00:01:48.630> actually<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.580> can<00:01:50.730> actually<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.150> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
131 actually so you can actually see the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.430 
131 actually so you can actually see the
size<00:01:51.450> difference<00:01:51.480> because<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.050> have<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.230> scale

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
size difference because I have a scale

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.610 
size difference because I have a scale
118<00:01:52.920> Ford<00:01:53.310> f-150<00:01:53.940> here<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
118 Ford f-150 here and there is the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.330 
118 Ford f-150 here and there is the
little<00:01:56.040> tiny<00:01:56.870> scale<00:01:57.870> on<00:01:57.960> 131<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.680> again<00:01:59.070> these

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
little tiny scale on 131 and again these

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.630 
little tiny scale on 131 and again these
back<00:01:59.550> doors<00:01:59.850> don't<00:01:59.970> open<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:01.250> it's<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.490> not

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
back doors don't open and it's just not

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.620 
back doors don't open and it's just not
as<00:02:02.760> realistic<00:02:03.000> overall<00:02:04.640> I've<00:02:05.640> got<00:02:05.880> mine<00:02:06.030> 124

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
as realistic overall I've got mine 124

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.170 
as realistic overall I've got mine 124
so<00:02:06.780> pretty<00:02:06.990> old
