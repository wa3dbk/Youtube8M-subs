00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.889
 I 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.829
 it is 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.649
 m 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 Pierre 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260
 no 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.870
 a thesis on the markets 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.860
 m 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.510
 but 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.380
 dr 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 she 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.110
 to warm up 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.110
 in this 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.219
 So the week this week chose 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.319
 to put to be Czech odoul barzagli 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.310
 in central defense accompanied by gary 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.260
 cahill on the right side glen johnson 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.989
 on the left side 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.099
 kwadwo asamoah in defensive midfield 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.340
 sergio boosket in middle isco and 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.909
 modric in attack 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.060
 eden hazard in right winger revealing to 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.879
 the winged left and messi in point in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.560
 scorer saran was hard to make a 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.239
 choice because there is really a lot of 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.980
 players who stood out but good 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.810
 it was necessary to make a choice despite everything 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.799
 because there is a football player 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.540
 unfortunately not at 15 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.189
 so here we hope you have 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.900
 enjoyed this video we will try to 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.120
 do better as time goes by 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.129

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.370
