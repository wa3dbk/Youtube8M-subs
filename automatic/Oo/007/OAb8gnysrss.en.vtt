I<00:04:53.180> think<00:04:53.479> you're<00:04:53.599> right<00:04:53.779> that<00:04:53.810> was<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.229> very

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
I think you're right that was a very

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.100 
I think you're right that was a very
accurate<00:04:54.889> assessment<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.699> speed<00:04:56.020> on<00:04:57.020> the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
accurate assessment the speed on the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:06.279 
accurate assessment the speed on the
previous<00:04:57.529> shot<00:04:57.710> was<00:04:57.919> much<00:04:58.189> lower<00:05:05.289> certainly

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
previous shot was much lower certainly

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.929 
previous shot was much lower certainly
