00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all so in this video I 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 show you how to clean the belly 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:14.219
 and hobbes pc from eisen so start 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.330
 you go to the product is your 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.300
 laptop if it matters to because 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 that son be she what is it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.500
 do not know too much I 'll do you a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 video they are not bad so you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.280
 will need a screwdriver 0.75 mm so 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 cruciform right here and in a tone of the EU 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.920
 in club zero fish it is a pity and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.910
 beforehand they had all the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.860
 visions of 15 be next 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.489
 so here you go loosen up a little 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.379
 everything and you will remove 14 to himself 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.789
 share 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.530
 you will remove actors and so you 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.620
 go can you see it you have 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 impact thermal paste 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 so here you are next on the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.769
 microprocessors you also had the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.939
 thermal paste if we miss 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:16.080
 you are changing your route and that's it 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.229
 but what interests us especially the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.189
 fan in a hatred for cash 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 is there you have to pay it so no need 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.390
 from the inside that counts close haunting 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.960
 of course and leaves also 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.960
 spent quite 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:46.969
 Saffron is a hoax relatively 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.959
 clean it's done you'll pay between 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:53.170
 the epal had to ventilate the ventilator 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.579
 so this step past what is it used to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.659
 improve past performance at this 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:04.609
 that he does send back here is also 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:12.049
 finally also so as they say 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:14.180
 and improve performance and especially the 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.890
 noise because I'm repeating it's 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.959
 damn the noise because it's 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.890
 really horrible to see an attack a 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.810
 sketch of his possibilities here it's 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.940
 annoying 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.230
 so I will not delay at this stage 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.609
 the party asked someone who is going scared 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.489
 amply it's not complicated at all 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.269
 but if you do not go out do this 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.700
 you do not have to put one 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:43.180
 microprocessor in place per donor 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:47.530
 is screwed up to clean all over 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.530
 so I'm going to be sinking 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.330
 nothing 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:01.739
 we see it does I think of course a 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.160
 small little leaves and there it is to finish 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:09.060
 by the balls his tip can you 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:18.780
 peace on the one hand because it jumps 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:20.550
 on discover to the sound of the video so a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900
 wrongly called I said it works very 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.459
 well 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.430
 it helps not to look too good and 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.860
 it's a little yes yes but especially 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.780
 of dust that's an element that 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.330
 do not pull out the nice little word that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.930
 the trial was not here it is necessary 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.400
 did it quite simple you would put and there 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.810
 explain to us how to put your 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.510
 micro processors because that's enough 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.569
 complicated not complicated but it's enough 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.380
 delicate when here you see it ages 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.790
 a small arrow 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:59.250
 here it will just look at the details 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.170
 so Norman you initiated us a 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.760
 little clash in my on the small side 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.680
 the microphone that we know that's all over the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.940
 world there is a fault here tomorrow because 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.980
 and watch over makeup eyes 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.500
 monflanquin i know that's my sense 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.729
 here it is just to ask it here this is 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:26.000
 not so much for example here once 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.000
 it's done I can give the cash 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.879
 here I put it back and the little screws 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.630
 so I serve 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.419
 Allah 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.600
 so I try not to put my hands 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:08.010
 see the year the camera screen be 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.010
 they are your coms and a good vision 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.760
 I want to apologize because it 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.410
 causes camera games on it so 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:25.030
 I do not know too much the quality does not 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:32.130
 not treat very good coop him if not j 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.130
 this for the next videos I serve 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:43.830
 I thank you meticulously do not hesitate to 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.160
 repeat several times if this is 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.900
 necessary of course I do not need 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:55.370
 of sun the exit will not be sure 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.370
 they do not know there it does not have to 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:07.680
 so we hope to put in the good 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:10.559
 so you have there I just have agents way of 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.899
 the enquÃªtre like me in this case 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.399
 you have to pay attention 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:18.960
 you 've been a little fast it's not 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:21.569
 bad it is important not that I 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.800
 felt it's pretty fat and good and 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:28.050
 especially not in auto javier after a 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.089
 first time the police 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.389
 it will have to be forced but because 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:37.169
 it's almost toxic it's a fact 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.349
 to feel but we live so badly 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:44.240
 picnic 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:48.839
 Here once that is done we put 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:57.889
 the convector up the little lives 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:57.889
 Here you renfermez microprocessors 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.110
 to better understand here more 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:18.180
 just put a window in 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:20.330
 place and you started your both 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.330
 uplands 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.530
 here I am going to finish just tight 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.139
 just in the past on 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:56.229
 only here so that's ch'ti who 

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.639
 video 

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.639
 thank you for watching
