00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

regular cross I think we do get another
volley<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.570> wet<00:01:18.750> Schneider<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.710> cool

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
keeper does save it so that is how the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
keeper does save it so that is how the
game<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.110> won<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> game<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.890> 21<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.759> we

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.390 
fully and we put it into the bottom
corner<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.660> make<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.840> 2-1<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:33.099> is<00:02:33.220> also

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
corner to make it 2-1 and that is also

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.490 
corner to make it 2-1 and that is also
how<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.670> game<00:02:34.030> manager<00:02:34.510> unfortunately<00:02:35.319> we

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
how the game manager unfortunately we

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.320 
how the game manager unfortunately we
didn't<00:02:36.040> really<00:02:36.130> create<00:02:36.370> anything<00:02:36.670> after<00:02:37.209> it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
didn't really create anything after it

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.670 
didn't really create anything after it
as<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.630> see<00:02:37.780> as<00:02:37.900> well<00:02:38.050> my<00:02:38.200> opponent<00:02:38.560> had<00:02:38.650> a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
as you can see as well my opponent had a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680 
as you can see as well my opponent had a
lot<00:02:38.950> more<00:02:39.130> possessions<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.910> guess<00:02:40.209> he

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
lot more possessions so I guess he

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
lot more possessions so I guess he
deserved<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.230> win<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> variant<00:02:41.950> even

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
deserved to win in the variant even

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.589 
deserved to win in the variant even
though<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.670> game<00:02:42.849> was<00:02:42.880> pretty<00:02:43.090> even<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.450> would

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
though the game was pretty even I would

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.360 
though the game was pretty even I would
say<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.110> when<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.590> look<00:02:44.739> at<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.040> shot

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
say when it when you look at it a shot

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.759 
say when it when you look at it a shot
twice<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:45.970> anyway<00:02:46.299> we<00:02:46.810> do<00:02:46.989> go<00:02:47.200> into<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.560> third

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.410 
twice but anyway we do go into the third

Elena<00:03:05.440> actually<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:05.920> keep<00:03:06.130> us<00:03:06.280> into<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.610> game

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
Elena actually to keep us into the game

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.820 
Elena actually to keep us into the game
in<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.000> 28th<00:03:07.480> minute<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:08.260> break<00:03:08.470> through<00:03:08.680> it

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
in the 28th minute we break through it

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.289 
in the 28th minute we break through it
with<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> robin<00:03:09.370> van<00:03:09.519> persie<00:03:09.580> but<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.209> can

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
with a robin van persie but as you can

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.880 
with a robin van persie but as you can
see<00:03:10.480> he<00:03:10.630> wasn't<00:03:10.810> really<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.170> fastest<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:11.860> I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
see he wasn't really the fastest so I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.259 
see he wasn't really the fastest so I
decide<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.310> pull<00:03:12.519> off<00:03:12.580> some<00:03:12.730> skin<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.120> but

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
decide to pull off some skin with but

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.479 
decide to pull off some skin with but
then<00:03:13.420> his<00:03:13.900> right<00:03:14.230> foot<00:03:14.470> was<00:03:14.739> really<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> best

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
then his right foot was really the best

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.949 
then his right foot was really the best
so<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.819> went<00:03:16.030> well<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.239> probably<00:03:16.569> should<00:03:16.870> have

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
so it went well I probably should have

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.599 
so it went well I probably should have
had<00:03:17.230> just<00:03:17.470> taken<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.829> shot<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.040> with<00:03:18.280> his<00:03:18.370> left

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
had just taken the shot I with his left

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.190 
had just taken the shot I with his left
foot<00:03:18.700> left<00:03:18.880> foot<00:03:19.150> then<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.079> before

which<00:05:03.250> puts<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.669> in<00:05:03.789> maybe<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.509> little<00:05:04.659> bit

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
which puts it in maybe a little bit

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.059 
which puts it in maybe a little bit
against<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.259> balance<00:05:05.560> of<00:05:05.620> play<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.949> he

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
against the balance of play that he

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.339 
against the balance of play that he
takes<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.460> leader<00:05:06.639> but<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.180> makes<00:05:07.659> it<00:05:07.840> 10<00:05:08.050> dead

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
takes a leader but it makes it 10 dead

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.619 
takes a leader but it makes it 10 dead
and<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.680> 67th<00:05:09.490> minute<00:05:09.580> we<00:05:10.030> mentioned<00:05:10.449> aside

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
and the 67th minute we mentioned aside

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.540 
and the 67th minute we mentioned aside
the<00:05:10.719> ball<00:05:10.870> I<00:05:10.900> with<00:05:11.110> toprock<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.740> tried<00:05:12.250> to<00:05:12.370> clear

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
the ball I with toprock I tried to clear

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.010 
the ball I with toprock I tried to clear
it<00:05:12.639> away<00:05:12.699> all<00:05:12.969> the<00:05:13.060> way<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.210> van<00:05:13.479> Persie<00:05:13.870> but

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
it away all the way to van Persie but

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.629 
it away all the way to van Persie but
then<00:05:14.139> he<00:05:14.289> managed<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.560> intercept<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.370> look<00:05:15.520> at

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
then he managed to intercept and look at

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.399 
then he managed to intercept and look at
the<00:05:15.699> bottom<00:05:16.000> right<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.300> went<00:05:16.629> ultra<00:05:16.780> attacking

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
the bottom right I went ultra attacking

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.080 
the bottom right I went ultra attacking
that<00:05:17.560> was<00:05:17.740> maybe<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:18.280> little<00:05:18.490> bit<00:05:18.639> stupid<00:05:18.819> for

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
that was maybe a little bit stupid for

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.999 
that was maybe a little bit stupid for
me<00:05:19.180> because<00:05:19.449> as<00:05:19.569> you<00:05:19.659> can<00:05:19.690> see<00:05:19.780> he<00:05:20.620> picks<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:20.919> up

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
me because as you can see he picks it up

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.649 
me because as you can see he picks it up
with<00:05:21.159> Ibrahimovic<00:05:21.610> turns<00:05:22.030> around<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.569> makes

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
with Ibrahimovic turns around and makes

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.140 
with Ibrahimovic turns around and makes
it<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.409> nil<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:23.949> yeah<00:05:24.430> makes<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.819> game<00:05:25.030> over

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
it to nil and yeah makes it game over

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.850 
it to nil and yeah makes it game over
basically<00:05:25.419> because<00:05:25.990> as<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:26.169> can<00:05:26.229> see<00:05:26.319> we<00:05:26.650> just

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
basically because as you can see we just

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.200 
basically because as you can see we just
couldn't<00:05:27.190> hit<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.340> target<00:05:27.789> we<00:05:27.940> do<00:05:28.060> get

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
couldn't hit the target we do get

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.180 
couldn't hit the target we do get
another<00:05:28.479> chance<00:05:28.690> with<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:29.020> TI<00:05:29.289> but<00:05:29.530> once<00:05:30.039> again

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
another chance with a TI but once again

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.100 
another chance with a TI but once again
it<00:05:30.400> was<00:05:30.520> serie<00:05:30.819> good<00:05:30.969> air<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.270> save<00:05:31.539> it<00:05:31.719> so<00:05:31.930> um

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
it was serie good air to save it so um

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.480 
it was serie good air to save it so um
yeah<00:05:32.259> that<00:05:32.409> was<00:05:32.529> a<00:05:32.560> little<00:05:32.740> bit<00:05:32.919> annoying<00:05:33.219> that

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
yeah that was a little bit annoying that

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.830 
yeah that was a little bit annoying that
we're<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.849> we<00:05:33.940> couldn't<00:05:34.240> hit<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.479> target

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
we're that we couldn't hit the target

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.209 
we're that we couldn't hit the target
that<00:05:34.930> we<00:05:35.020> couldn't<00:05:35.319> get<00:05:35.409> a<00:05:35.469> go<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:35.889> and<00:05:36.069> that

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
that we couldn't get a go but and that

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:37.920 
that we couldn't get a go but and that
is<00:05:36.310> how<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.610> sometimes<00:05:36.759> so<00:05:37.630> yeah<00:05:37.719> we<00:05:37.810> lost

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
is how it is sometimes so yeah we lost

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.450 
is how it is sometimes so yeah we lost
the<00:05:38.080> game<00:05:38.199> wit<00:05:38.409> to<00:05:38.710> nil<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.130> as<00:05:39.279> you<00:05:39.340> can<00:05:39.430> see

the game wit to nil and as you can see
from<00:05:39.729> the<00:05:39.880> stats<00:05:40.120> as<00:05:40.270> well<00:05:40.419> it<00:05:40.479> was<00:05:40.630> pretty

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
from the stats as well it was pretty

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.510 
from the stats as well it was pretty
even<00:05:41.169> in<00:05:41.289> there<00:05:41.469> in<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.710> variant<00:05:42.069> but<00:05:42.219> anyway

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
even in there in the variant but anyway

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.279
