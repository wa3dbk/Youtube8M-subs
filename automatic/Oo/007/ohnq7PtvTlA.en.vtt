 dr 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.820
 Let's talk about proteins 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.689
 two 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:14.409
 proteins play a fundamental role for life 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:21.079
 are part of the basic structure of our fabrics especially the 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.050
 muscles 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.710
 the scientific sources of proteins include meat 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.349
 it was a shock big legumes and dairy products 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.400
 the egg protein is considered as a reference point to compare 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.900
 nutritionally to the other proteins of the different foods 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.210
 these injured here is the protein with the highest biological value 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.170
 egg protein contains an excellent combination of eight 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.220
 essential amino acids and other amino acids of sulfur content that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 they are vital for the organism 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.480
 the egg white 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.030
 I am very good moment that provides totally fat-free proteins 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.390
 so 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.940
 how can we provide our bodies with large amounts of streets 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.630
 your egg proteins to remove it increase muscle mass without elevating 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 our cholesterol level 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.740
 if this spectrum more 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.109
 It is a thoughtful snapshot of high-efficiency prostheses 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.080
 also made of albumin to escape clear dehydrated 100% natural 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.970
 has been formulated to provide essential amino acids and proteins without 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 raise your cholesterol level 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.899
 a measure called and very hard equals the nutritional value of five 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.310
 fresh egg whites 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.900
 this is easy digestion 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.079
 thanks that includes an exclusive enzyme complex 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.439
 that also helps the performance of all the nutrients and thinks for 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.439
 accelerate the metabolism 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.659
 how the stomach works 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.519
 sports activities demand large amounts of protein 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:22.269
 the more example provides the amount needed to provide more picore 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.699
 who exhibits 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:28.419
 This wonderful supplement is ideal for athletes who want to increase their 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.419
 performance and muscle mass 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.949
 the most example helps children in their growth stage 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.959
 they can also consume it in financial matters with a diet 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.900
 deficient since it is an easy assimilation complement 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.629
 is promax the protein supplement designed for your wellbeing
