things<00:02:45.980> are<00:02:46.129> getting<00:02:46.370> difficult

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.009 

y'see<00:02:52.000> she's<00:02:52.269> obviously<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.900> where

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
y'see she's obviously really where

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.420 
y'see she's obviously really where
they're<00:02:53.170> setting<00:02:53.379> you<00:02:53.590> up<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.099> thought

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
they're setting you up so you thought

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.890 
they're setting you up so you thought
well<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:57.489> not<00:02:57.730> full<00:02:58.000> up<00:02:58.150> great<00:02:58.420> certainly

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
well if not full up great certainly

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.229 
well if not full up great certainly
almost<00:02:59.049> older<00:02:59.590> than<00:02:59.739> mine<00:02:59.980> I've<00:03:00.099> got<00:03:00.280> 22<00:03:00.940> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
almost older than mine I've got 22 so

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.449 
almost older than mine I've got 22 so
I'm<00:03:01.360> probably<00:03:01.629> haven't<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.650> good<00:03:02.830> enough

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.600 

so<00:03:06.459> our<00:03:06.700> essence<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.150> Shawn<00:03:07.860> hook<00:03:08.860> got<00:03:09.040> crooked

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
so our essence is Shawn hook got crooked

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.860 
so our essence is Shawn hook got crooked
I've<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.880> even<00:03:09.970> caught<00:03:10.270> when<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.510> body<00:03:10.690> up

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
I've not even caught when you body up

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:30.870 
I've not even caught when you body up
you<00:03:11.020> in<00:03:11.080> two-thirds<00:03:11.470> left

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.120 

it's<00:03:31.660> definitely<00:03:31.840> I've<00:03:32.410> expected<00:03:32.890> it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
it's definitely I've expected it

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.620 
it's definitely I've expected it

for that but we see they cannot sign for
