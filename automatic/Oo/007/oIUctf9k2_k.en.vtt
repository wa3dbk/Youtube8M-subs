bodyboard mount is on the left side so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
bodyboard mount is on the left side so
it's<00:00:24.090> fine<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> fine<00:00:25.470> spot<00:00:25.830> if

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you're gonna go right but if you go left

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.519 
you're gonna go right but if you go left

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it has certain issues with just being on

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.200 
it has certain issues with just being on
the<00:00:31.650> wrong<00:00:31.800> side<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> wave<00:00:32.820> kind<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the wrong side and the wave kind of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.900 
the wrong side and the wave kind of
washes<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> view<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.430> video<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
washes out the view so in this video you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.900 
washes out the view so in this video you
can<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.930> happens<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> try<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> go

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
can see what happens if you try to go

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.350 
can see what happens if you try to go
left

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
left

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.049 
left
so<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.770> video<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.730> I'm

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
so from this video you can see that I'm

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.060 
so from this video you can see that I'm
trying<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.600> left<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.739> did<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
trying to go left and I really did the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
trying to go left and I really did the
left<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> washed<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.660> or

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
left it's not that it washed out or

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
left it's not that it washed out or
anything<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.489> body<00:00:48.030> board<00:00:48.270> man

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
anything but because the body board man

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.819 
anything but because the body board man
and<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> camera<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> left<00:00:49.710> side

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and the camera was on the left side

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.040 
and the camera was on the left side
that's<00:00:50.430> why<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> water<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that's why you see all the water and the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.869 
that's why you see all the water and the
spray<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.160> can't<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> good

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
spray and you can't really get a good

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.959 
spray and you can't really get a good
view<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> thus<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> problem<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
view so this thus is the problem with

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.070 
view so this thus is the problem with
the<00:00:57.510> body<00:00:57.719> board<00:00:57.960> mount<00:00:58.199> being<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.859> side

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.690 

the<00:01:04.080> body<00:01:04.320> board<00:01:04.589> mount<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.460> better

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the body board mount a little bit better

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
the body board mount a little bit better
for<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> view<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.600> store<00:01:10.200> today

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
for the view so I was in a store today

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.280 
for the view so I was in a store today
and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.760> saw<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.810> GoPro<00:01:13.850> gooseneck<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> let<00:01:16.200> me

show you basically what you can do with

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929 
show you basically what you can do with
this<00:01:18.659> gooseneck<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:19.560> having<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:20.640> me

this gooseneck if you're having like me

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.630 
this gooseneck if you're having like me
the<00:01:21.600> body<00:01:21.990> board<00:01:22.320> mount<00:01:22.680> issues<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:23.490> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the body board mount issues where it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
the body board mount issues where it's
just<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> wrong<00:01:24.330> wrong<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.920> it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
just on the wrong wrong side or if it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
just on the wrong wrong side or if it's
maybe<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.549> too<00:01:26.700> close<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.390> board<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
maybe just too close to your board and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.390 
maybe just too close to your board and
you're<00:01:27.990> getting<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> spray<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:28.979> water

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you're getting a lot of spray and water

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:52.790 
you're getting a lot of spray and water
and<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> greatest<00:01:30.509> view<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.350 

I<00:01:56.330> can<00:01:57.330> flip<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.630> camera<00:01:57.870> way<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:58.440> here<00:01:59.060> if<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
I can flip the camera way over here if I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
I can flip the camera way over here if I
am<00:02:00.540> gonna<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.320> left<00:02:01.530> where<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.550> I<00:02:02.700> am

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
am gonna go to the left where if I am

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:14.620 
am gonna go to the left where if I am
going<00:02:03.120> sorry<00:02:04.080> I'm<00:02:04.260> gonna<00:02:04.350> go<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.890> right

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.350 

like<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.900> gooseneck<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.770> place

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
like so so with the gooseneck in place

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.850 
like so so with the gooseneck in place
now<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.600> I'm<00:02:21.780> gonna<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.940> left<00:02:24.240> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
now if I'm gonna be going to the left I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:33.050 
now if I'm gonna be going to the left I
can<00:02:25.860> pull<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.550> camera<00:02:31.160> closer<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> middle

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
can pull the camera closer to the middle

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060 
can pull the camera closer to the middle
or<00:02:33.180> even<00:02:33.240> farther<00:02:33.780> over<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> right

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
or even farther over here to the right

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.180 
or even farther over here to the right
so<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.120> not<00:02:36.270> gonna<00:02:36.450> get<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.380> way<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
so it's not gonna get in the way of the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.600 
so it's not gonna get in the way of the
waves<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.700> waves<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.300> gonna<00:02:39.510> cause<00:02:40.410> problems

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
waves the waves not gonna cause problems

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:55.820 
waves the waves not gonna cause problems
and<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.480> go<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.200> right<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:55.320> move<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
and if I go to the right I can move the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.699 
and if I go to the right I can move the
camera<00:02:56.070> position<00:02:56.930> way<00:02:57.930> over<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
camera position way over here to the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.260 
camera position way over here to the
left<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.600> again<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> main<00:03:00.930> issue<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:02.270> getting

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
left and again the main issue is getting

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.910 
left and again the main issue is getting
an<00:03:03.360> off<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.540> board<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.350> don't<00:03:04.530> get<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.739> whole

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
an off the board so we don't get a whole

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.170 
an off the board so we don't get a whole
lot<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.220> spray<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.880> wave<00:03:06.260> interference<00:03:07.260> and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
lot of spray and wave interference and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.560 
lot of spray and wave interference and
also<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.570> get<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.410> be<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:11.150> either<00:03:12.150> side

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
also we can get it to be on either side

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.180 
also we can get it to be on either side
of<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.810> board<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:13.800> doesn't<00:03:14.040> matter

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
of the board so it really doesn't matter

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.140 
of the board so it really doesn't matter
which<00:03:14.550> way<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.690> wave<00:03:15.870> we're<00:03:16.590> gonna<00:03:16.830> go<00:03:17.150> so

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
which way on the wave we're gonna go so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.640 
which way on the wave we're gonna go so
hope<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.540> helped<00:03:18.930> hope<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> good

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
hope that helped hope that was a good

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.180 
hope that helped hope that was a good
idea<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:21.570> gooseneck<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> store<00:03:22.860> was

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
idea and the gooseneck in the store was

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.490 
idea and the gooseneck in the store was
$20<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.300> don't<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.660> if<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:24.989> get<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> mini

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
$20 I don't know if you can get the mini

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.160 
$20 I don't know if you can get the mini
cheaper<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.570> thought<00:03:27.690> I'd<00:03:27.870> run<00:03:27.989> that

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
cheaper but just thought I'd run that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.390 
cheaper but just thought I'd run that
tip<00:03:28.410> by<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.650> okay<00:03:29.400> hope<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.790> enjoy<00:03:30.060> bye
