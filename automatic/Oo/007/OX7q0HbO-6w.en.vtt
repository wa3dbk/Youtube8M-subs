00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:10.800
 well this is an informative video of 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.349
 hannah in hama and I already showed you some 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.090
 creations I had made and a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.970
 update done but I had not 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.989
 talked about them then like that 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.659
 I want to tell you about it so you know 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:24.010
 what is more or less and then 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:28.350
 they encourage you to try it 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.820
 I'll start to ever start 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.450
 good 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.190
 these contents that you see here 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 I suppose there will be many people who 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.570
 I already know him because there are many videos 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.610
 medical 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.520
 what are tutorials and those 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.520
 things but good I say an opinion of mine 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 nothing happened but the same hospital 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.350
 this in particular are not the brand 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.350
 original that is jama h 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.699
 and this is the d 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:16.620
 the label that is the island so they are 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.020
 it consists of the same with difference of 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.320
 that the colors are different is not the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320
 brand 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.229
 As you can see, the boat is in the middle 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.229
 more or less 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:39.210
 and as you can see there is green blue 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.170
 brown orange and I all colors 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.009
 black and white and is that I have spent them 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.840
 from so much use it was worn and I 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.720
 there are very few then just then 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.790
 no longer serve these colors I do not like 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.490
 a lot because it's not like they're colors 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.119
 Pretty fluent pink is a very color 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.119
 fluorine and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 but I said to try it then I try with 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.170
 this is that they are cheaper and I do not know in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.470
 how much it can cost but it's cheaper 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.380
 that the machine 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.000
 this I also found in a store 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.000
 toys to the banner thinks marquez is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.640
 and if you start and it's also a mix and what 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.799
 I bought more than anything because I had meat 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.280
 whiter and more black and what is 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:38.140
 manage it in this box 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.140
 You saw me white and this black 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.960
 and here I have a number was colors I have 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.490
 purple 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.800
 more beautiful the truth and here I have a 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.650
 little black and white and there's also 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.650
 the occasional translucent account 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:04.489
 and apart also in the package comes with 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.680
 the big plate a smaller plate one 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.150
 of heart and another of circle that I have 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.299
 lost but more or less so that the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.099
 di are ideas of heart to have this way 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.530
 even if it has a creation and the circle 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.730
 is 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.370
 and well this one also I basically this 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.050
 I used it at the beginning like that but I have not 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.480
 found much use of these two 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.610
 and I have the little picture that is for 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.080
 smaller creations and the other for 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.770
 rest creations the truth is the one that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.830
 it's used 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.390
 This is a day and I want to do with me 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.450
 those of Hama because those of Hamas have 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.790
 as a voice that quotes and you go linking 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.770
 a picture with another then then do 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 creations are much larger than it is 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.110
 what I'm looking for now because then 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.110
 more or less 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.540
 it also comes with paper east 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.989
 vegetable 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.140
 but I use paper towels because 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.350
 bring on being more sing to the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.390
 so he decided to be these 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.190
 also from another brand out there I found 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.440
 some other different that you can 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.780
 finding in bazaars and stores in 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.980
 crafts more or less and then already 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.980
 creations do not 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.290
 I have some and you can see my videos in 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.630
 my channel of all the facilities and 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.220
 copy them some are from the internet and I 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.419
 I see that the tutorials that there are in 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.400
 youtube like they do not serve much 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.470
 because you do this quietly in the picture of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.940
 how are you going counting the 20 quotes and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.440
 You're doing, you do not have to 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.990
 teach how they are done because if you know 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.139
 do one you already know how to do them all by 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.300
 web and after that I'll tell you more 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.060
 more or less the procedure proceeds 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.600
 but there is already a tutorial in case it is left 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.500
 some doubt and it is 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.540
 basically you take your plate a mold 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.990
 this you take your account with a 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.910
 Go back and put it wherever you go 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.120
 in the pinchitos these is that it is not going to 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.120
 keep 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:20.500
 he puts it in a pinch 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.130
 you take your account and put it 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.930
 another and you put another you're putting 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.020
 imagine that this is what I want 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.310
 do 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.910
 I take my 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.910
 vegetal paper 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.350
 and I could 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.540
 I take an iron to iron the clothes and it is 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.710
 I do not have it for balances 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.840
 we just passed the iron once 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.580
 that is hot we wash platz going on 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.380
 over until the top part is 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.300
 see melted as you will realize 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.250
 there is a good need because here 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.350
 the more or less clearly planned the 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.050
 color is going to notice much more and it's going to 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.930
 see the widest account and that's why we do not 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.930
 we will give separate account remains of 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.910
 exercise already in the class we remove the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.010
 role and what I always do is that 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.080
 because if you remove directly the 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.970
 figure that you can remove the points 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.530
 hands because if you're not going to burn 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.950
 to remove with any a hook or what 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.750
 to be 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.790
 if the base leaves it to dry alone it 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.690
 goes to pump is going to double the same 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.860
 heat then what I do is that 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.980
 minimally when on the plate 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.890
 I just ironed and I turn around and 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:38.530
 I'm in a few minutes pushing against 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:41.409
 something something solid some floor and in fact 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:45.039
 the iron is bent 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:48.009
 from the heat itself then it opened 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:51.639
 then I am already clear because it was 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:54.459
 uncomfortable and it's very easy then of that 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.989
 iron come to be seen to me so 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.419
 least I like the ironed side more 

00:06:55.989 --> 00:07:00.399
 this is the side lie is not there 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.989
 tired on both sides there 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:04.349
 some that I have planted by both 

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:04.349
 sides 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.390
 and mario bros on this side that is 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.520
 ironed it and it shows that 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.910
 they are melted 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.699
 and on this side you do not see the accounts 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.169
 this is the side that is not hooked and 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:24.300
 Yes this is the one I like more 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:27.270
 that if ironed 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.729
 I do not know how I like how he stays asked 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.810
 here we went or for the accounts and good 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:33.820
 Well, you can see 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.740
 the melted account is more or less 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.540
 half of the account I like quite 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.169
 melted at the time they are well founded and 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:44.569
 stay in everything even and smooth and nobody 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.520
 I think I have nothing left to say 

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:49.069
 you can find different brands in the 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.870
 market you can find hama beats that 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:54.030
 is the original to feel it 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.070
 brands as well as ours 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.170
 such toy stores 

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.540
 also those of ikea you can also 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.790
 find but read videos that is another 

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:06.129
 brand that is also quite well known and 

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:09.939
 that I know good and copies and yes 

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:12.279
 and I think it's already there and I do not expect anything 

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:16.979
 I liked you and I will do some tutorial and 

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:16.979
 such and see you the next video bye bye
