00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
starting off a really thin on the inner

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.320 
starting off a really thin on the inner
corner<00:01:44.680> of<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.830> eye<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.340> going<00:01:45.670> thicker<00:01:46.030> on

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
corner of the eye and going thicker on

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.120 
corner of the eye and going thicker on
the<00:01:46.510> outer<00:01:46.690> corner<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.229> eye<00:01:47.350> with<00:01:48.100> a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
slight flick at the end so it is a bit

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.640 
slight flick at the end so it is a bit
tricky<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.680> do<00:01:50.940> but<00:01:51.940> practice<00:01:52.690> makes<00:01:52.720> perfect

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
a flick so starts off really thin on

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.020 
a flick so starts off really thin on
this<00:02:05.080> end<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.680> quite<00:02:06.220> thick<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.880> other

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
this end and quite thick on the other

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.260 
this end and quite thick on the other
end<00:02:07.240> into<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.259> point<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.100> very<00:02:09.310> Marilyn<00:02:09.729> Monroe
