00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.070
 hello everyone with you fly and this is a semi review 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.800
 on the game call of duty gost 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.660
 which did infinity ward no where 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.730
 software and raven software 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.160
 I do not know why but after me 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.770
 enumeration of studio names is requested 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.650
 picture with a bear out of the bushes here is direct 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:40.540
 here by the way into the light of the game released 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:42.970
 activision although who cares 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.010
 say that the code series is now dead and not 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.739
 is nothing interesting 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.739
 Although if you take the calculation of black ops 2 then 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.780
 I liked it but they did this game 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.540
 other disabled people who over time 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.729
 understand what it has to do and a lot 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.760
 creative ideas brought to the series in 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.400
 whole and do not forget that today we 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.950
 talking about ghosts though talking about 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.040
 I don't really want them in the game so much 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.070
 all the curves bespontovo that seems like 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.820
 the game did 5 drunken homeless themselves in 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.039
 box and you are all by the standards of 2013 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.490
 just looks like a golem cardboard 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.219
 wooden limited sad game 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.039
 infuriates after an hour of play and freezes 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.329
 so much it seems like 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.060
 more disgusting nothing can be done 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.159
 the whole story campaign is traversed behind 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.429
 four and a half five hours 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.899
 it is not clear why 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.810
 developers in the demonstrations focused 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.869
 the fact that the game is in principle imperceptible and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.630
 not visible no of course if so 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.630
 think and resolution of human textures 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.020
 Increased all kinds of lighting 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.969
 filters that make the picture more pleasant 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.079
 but very rarely where is it really 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.040
 visible and in principle this is not enough 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.560
 plus I'm not sure what was needed 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.050
 treat the volume of the game because of this only until 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.290
 35 gigabytes on hard disk 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.930
 although maybe this doggy began to occupy and 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.230
 artificial intelligence of fish which so 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 boasted developers don't know gameplay 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.090
 sad at first from the camera which 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.630
 sausage sick as if I have an introductory 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.120
 illness and although I donâ€™t have one 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.130
 there was never artificial intelligence 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.350
 electronic boobs not far gone 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.800
 belches in places at all seems like 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.860
 the brain is the same for all partners 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.380
 feeling that somewhere i already saw it all 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.620
 I do not argue in previous games in the series this 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.780
 it was also noticeable but not so much for 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.510
 passage time I remembered such 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.290
 movies like the beginning and the dark knight 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.050
 revival fu return of the legend 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.130
 the game will be a storm and a whole bunch of parodies 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.820
 stamps for the whole series of modern warfare with 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.170
 Battlefield scene like one-to-one 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.140
 copied without adding something 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.930
 from their copied they are extremely curves 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.760
 it's okay though they won the disease 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.340
 scripts but sorry that the pieces 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.620
 In general, the game as you already understood causes 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.110
 solid negative and frustration can 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.850
 because we're growing up or snickering 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.580
 although I'm still at the time of writing 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.580
 text failed battlefield 4 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.969
 I think that my joyful opinion at the time 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.060
 end 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:43.209

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.239
