pretty<00:03:22.200> well<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.530> 70<00:03:22.800> days<00:03:22.980> but<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.280> know

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
pretty well get to 70 days but you know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.610 
pretty well get to 70 days but you know
reduce<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> small<00:03:24.810> amount<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.200> then<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
reduce it to the small amount and then I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.050

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
options there because the risk is if I

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.640
