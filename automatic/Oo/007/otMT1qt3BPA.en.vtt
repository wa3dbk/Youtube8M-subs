typically<00:01:39.070> most<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.340> my<00:01:40.430> cast<00:01:40.700> got<00:01:40.910> better<00:01:41.150> we

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
typically most of my cast got better we

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.940 
typically most of my cast got better we
got<00:01:41.510> three<00:01:41.780> units<00:01:41.930> don't<00:01:42.230> like<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.530> half<00:01:42.770> of

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
got three units don't like that half of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.940 
got three units don't like that half of
that<00:01:43.070> look<00:01:43.400> at<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.580> souls<00:01:44.740> nothing<00:01:45.740> maybe

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
that look at the souls nothing maybe

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.950 
that look at the souls nothing maybe
even<00:01:46.160> nothing<00:01:46.310> close<00:01:46.610> like<00:01:46.790> 100,000<00:01:47.690> but<00:01:47.870> I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
even nothing close like 100,000 but I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.390 
even nothing close like 100,000 but I
get<00:01:48.170> about<00:01:48.610> 20k<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.910> think<00:01:50.180> souls<00:01:50.510> of<00:01:50.690> run

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
get about 20k I think souls of run

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.800 
get about 20k I think souls of run
through<00:01:52.400> this<00:01:52.520> area<00:01:52.850> including<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.600> gallery

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
through this area including this gallery

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.420 
through this area including this gallery
which<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.260> think<00:01:54.470> gives<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> about<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.980> thousand

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
which I think gives you about a thousand

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.100 
which I think gives you about a thousand
and<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:56.240> run<00:01:56.360> back<00:01:56.480> in<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.660> bonfire<00:01:56.870> or

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
and then just run back in the bonfire or

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.640 
and then just run back in the bonfire or
if<00:01:57.560> you're<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.070> miracle<00:01:58.580> base<00:01:59.290> fake<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.620> know

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
if you're a miracle base fake you know

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.860 
if you're a miracle base fake you know
you<00:02:00.830> take<00:02:01.040> your<00:02:01.100> space<00:02:01.370> base<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:02.720> can

actually<00:02:03.020> cast<00:02:03.380> home<00:02:03.650> working<00:02:03.980> is<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.220> little

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
actually cast home working is a little

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.520 
actually cast home working is a little
bit<00:02:04.940> quicker<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.360> shaves<00:02:05.600> off<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.810> few<00:02:06.080> seconds

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
bit quicker it shaves off a few seconds

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.050 
bit quicker it shaves off a few seconds
now<00:02:07.010> like<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.220> said<00:02:07.280> there's<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.610> few<00:02:07.640> way<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.880> do

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
now like I said there's a few way to do

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.450 
now like I said there's a few way to do
it<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:08.390> way<00:02:08.570> just<00:02:08.600> few<00:02:09.470> ways<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
it this way just few ways to do this the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.820 
it this way just few ways to do this the
quickest<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:11.000> which<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.620> discovered<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.740> my

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
is really really useful to farm this way

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.450 
is really really useful to farm this way
also<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.990> just<00:03:08.380> by<00:03:08.530> tweaking<00:03:08.770> taking<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.370> to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
also like just by tweaking taking it to
