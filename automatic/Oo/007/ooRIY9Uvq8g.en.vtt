00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.140 
that can cause a poor an application to
get<00:00:52.140> stuck<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.610> Windows<00:00:53.909> things

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150

but in the Apple menu there's this thing

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
but in the Apple menu there's this thing
called<00:01:30.420> force<00:01:31.110> quit<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> bring<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
up you're more likely going to find that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.510 
up you're more likely going to find that
your<00:01:34.619> application<00:01:34.710> says<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.369> responding

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
your application says not responding

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.120
