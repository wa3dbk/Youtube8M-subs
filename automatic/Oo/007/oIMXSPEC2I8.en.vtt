00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.300
 to this new video today a team of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.539
 the fucking seasons word pictures here for 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 there are some tips suites players 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 four in the number 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 but it could even be five I have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.519
 But then I actually bought it 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.050
 because there was the press and just too 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 high but we will then immediately 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 we'll start with the first 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.340
 goalie this is adria i just know 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.489
 not to be called by a first name 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.570
 take care to look again directly 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.260
 you see his first name is lindsay 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.450
 pronounce 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.770
 a very good keeper has got it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.210
 play with the team that made me 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 also completely convinced in hindsight but 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930
 also played again with the team and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710
 also have the perfect wait there too 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 ever second 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.489
 This one is a good boy, too 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 from the premier league look at you now 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 simply defend its values to be 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.239
 tempo is fully in order to make it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 so worthy defense worth and very much 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 to ramos in our second advantage 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.320
 Of course a good man, I believe 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.840
 We have three leagues at the start 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.909
 unfortunately not nlb but still so far 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.720
 I think quite reasonable quarterly 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.460
 we have here then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 Here you can also get a man on 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.659
 get the match variant or even 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 cover as in form is in knowledge 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.979
 but this man on the match 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 Search ye just get out yes alex 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.110
 he or alex does not know how to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 pronounce him and he would just enter 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 a little more cost is the price 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.909
 at 90,000 and he is not sold 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 that's why I do not have one with you 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.400
 brought it recover in the third team 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.979
 of the seas that is valued one 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 first bertram no idea in any case 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.310
 he too a superman 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.299
 Who do I think of the players? 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.149
 we'll go back so well 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.860
 Gameplay is also on the start today and that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.740
 is a third team offensive player 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.939
 and for this next player you have to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.860
 first looking for a bit that is 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.340
 a connection player that is, so to speak 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.020
 he mol here but otherwise too 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.579
 a very good man and I think his 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 I will go to physis and defense 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.990
 fully clear except speed shot and pass 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.579
 is it I think everything is okay 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.000
 the pass is okay too 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.229
 that definitely good man 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.120
 then we also have here still in 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.470
 team ramÃ­rez the all-rounder so if 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
 her in midfield have then you are 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.880
 in midfield I think the king 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.990
 as the real really good man 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.890
 the worth it in any case the times 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.630
 try 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.160
 I have that one already 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.780
 or other times in a spot in it 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.240
 rafinha is in our next 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.340
 player connects the whole here as well as 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.959
 unfortunately no nrw for example 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.090
 Players like Kassandra from projects 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.620
 data left no more 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.470
 But I think you would have been from this team 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 but I was able to make a team in nrw 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.730
 the right voice here register 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.730
 if that 's it at the start so still 25 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.200
 stars killer here in the team and a team 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.989
 of the seas and players is missing 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.480
 Of course, and besides, I would have 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.250
 now had another variant 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.280
 that is actually a fifth of the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.380
 season player scott yes that is 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.750
 once he's here jackson martin is the one 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.580
 we're watching him in the back 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.270
 Of course there is also a team and that 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.160
 I realize 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.480
 only his team on the sweet variation 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.910
 and you guys out there and you 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.340
 probably knows his price range 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.450
 that was at the time where I am 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.250
 recorded at 250,000 years old 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.830
 the startup cup winner, there are two 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.530
 teams these variants and its totally 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.850
 for but okay I have in any case 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.380
 his one player from tested.de 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.690
 Feeling then also really good and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.000
 here have served that this the star 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.820
 So this sports a towering one 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.330
 manier janek gola she looks in shape 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.150
 that at 93 paces weak foot 4 stars 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.459
 if so, and so on 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.190
 is really a superior man the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.570
 We recommend everyone to try and then 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.769
 I want to say start already directly 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.690
 I have a game now 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.519
 is done now I think so 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.989
 also with a little comment 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.900
 And the team does not look too bad 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.829
 from yes who mirko calculator on the ndp and 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.530
 Maxim 35 is still here 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.760
 a bit of postage a bit psv 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.750
 Eindhoven was that, but I think so 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.720
 we have the first batch directly 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.540
 appreciate martin is so great 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.549
 shot in the short corner and I'll tell you 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.380
 So as you can times also good cook 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.450
 play with the normal player of 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.310
 six months is that is really one 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.440
 outstanding man that is worthwhile in the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.780
 x to test that did not do 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.160
 the next chance will be a calvin here 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.230
 with the sculptures in the middle pulls 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.310
 the shot is blocked but then 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.380
 our opponent can come forward 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.260
 Adrian show what he can do 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.700
 by vienna message and adrian with 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.990
 We see help from the Torlinetechnik 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.880
 now not the ball again 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.860
 Behind the line was a great parade of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.480
 I like to touch eight, but I do not 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 the right one with great technology 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.890
 could still mend a bit it 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.140
 very clear but otherwise really great 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.850
 parry these two from adrian to ours 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.470
 keeper here not bad either 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.970
 The good man costs 50,000 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.980
 exactly how could the defender 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.260
 and how do you see me now ? 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.010
 had a lot of chances and thought 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.540
 I can not go on like this 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.800
 That's why I have a few more opportunities 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.180
 in the second half 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.550
 cut or on the second 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.560
 at half-time then the game starts 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.630
 out on carla del ponte with the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.150
 flank Calvin and he sits down 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.620
 That's what we say in the header duel 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.480
 and unfortunately he does not behead the ball 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.520
 vola she comes here 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.740
 with a shooter with another train 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.840
 inside and also his dribbling I say 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.070
 now so over powered so who 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.470
 a sick ball control 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.790
 Overall, I do not celebrate things that far 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.650
 he is a bit too big for that 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.300
 a wing player but such a left 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.620
 Striker so as a left striker you can 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.850
 who likes to play 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.730
 Of course, let's make the wine then 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.720
 also purely refined just seen 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.310
 even with a nice lift you 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.440
 really have good players from many players 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.880
 Chances then adrian has the first 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.100
 times parried the second at Canada 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.419
 do nothing 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.340
 that is now unfortunately times then briefly 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.470
 jackson on free kick shortly 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.110
 martinez with the perfect because fits in 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.610
 the run and brother you so the 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.500
 also close all the time must 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.550
 to say frankly but I have the 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.250
 Chance then somehow not so used 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.790
 and maxim well and glad it can 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.110
 51 are also available but unfortunately 22 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.390
 and 6 o'clock martin is then again 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.830
 a chance shoots the outpost 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.230
 so of course there is the normal 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.340
 Variation would be a possibility 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.470
 every time a good man you have to 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.880
 Try every case, yes and 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.669
 especially if his team on this then 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.510
 cheaper then you can get the 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.030
 I think, pick it up 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.160
 Six teams in their wonderful 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.780
 combination again to the data 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.630
 we last chance my friends yes 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.730
 and now we have seen 120 minutes 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.650
 already there comes the yannik buhl asi and 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.930
 then that makes it outstanding and the ball 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.330
 Just land behind the line 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.990
 not looking you the normal my needs 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.400
 actually a bit 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.020
 Discontinuation make the team everyone 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.850
 case really crass but then with 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.130
 the goalkeeping technique I have to 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.789
 hold something so celebrated yes in 120 minutes 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:48.360
 or you with a sugar with one 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:49.860
 sugar lift over the keeper and yes so 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.539
 it looks like if the ball then in 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.610
 bulla she goes even then the mesh 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.259
 with two goals and a goal assist it 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.699
 is so outstanding that a player 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.990
 Things are definitely testing out 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.370
 I actually have that too 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.509
 got missing relatively quickly 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.650
 If you're interested in that , I can 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.340
 of course again 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.139
 release 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.370
 otherwise I would say I am 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.449

 That's why we fell for it 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.539

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.889

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:15.320
