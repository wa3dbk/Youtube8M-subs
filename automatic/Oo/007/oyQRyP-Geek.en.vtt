today's<00:00:01.079> march<00:00:01.410> eight<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:02.280> i<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:03.090> want<00:00:03.240> to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
today's march eight and i just want to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.420 
today's march eight and i just want to
show<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.570> status<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.200> robot<00:00:04.470> i

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
show you the status of the robot i

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.000 
show you the status of the robot i
worked<00:00:06.000> on<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> accelerometer<00:00:07.290> up<00:00:07.350> top<00:00:07.560> i<00:00:07.799> had

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
worked on the accelerometer up top i had

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.190 
worked on the accelerometer up top i had
to<00:00:08.099> add<00:00:08.189> two<00:00:08.429> capacitors<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:10.139> help

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
to add two capacitors to it to help

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.690 
to add two capacitors to it to help
filter<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.620> some<00:00:10.860> noise<00:00:11.040> i<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.340> getting<00:00:11.610> on

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
filter out some noise i was getting on

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.020 
filter out some noise i was getting on
the<00:00:11.820> analogic<00:00:12.599> side<00:00:12.860> it<00:00:13.860> operates<00:00:14.219> at<00:00:14.340> 3.3

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the analogic side it operates at 3.3

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.070 
the analogic side it operates at 3.3
volts<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:16.520> msp430<00:00:17.520> works<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> 3.3<00:00:18.779> volts

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
volts on msp430 works at the 3.3 volts

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.769 
volts on msp430 works at the 3.3 volts
but<00:00:19.170> everything<00:00:19.439> else<00:00:19.560> works<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.949> 5<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.779> input

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
but everything else works on 5 and input

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
but everything else works on 5 and input
into<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> motors<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.650> 14<00:00:23.070> point<00:00:23.279> 4<00:00:23.519> volts<00:00:23.550> so

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
into the motors is 14 point 4 volts so

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.349 
into the motors is 14 point 4 volts so
that's<00:00:24.449> unregulated<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:26.029> basically<00:00:27.029> what's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that's unregulated and basically what's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.220 
that's unregulated and basically what's
happening<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:28.160> getting<00:00:29.160> steady<00:00:29.880> discharge<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
happening is getting steady discharge of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
happening is getting steady discharge of
energy<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> ground<00:00:32.130> stays<00:00:32.489> nice<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
energy the ground stays nice and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.930 
energy the ground stays nice and
comfortable<00:00:33.570> after<00:00:34.430> several<00:00:35.430> caps<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
comfortable after several caps on the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.830 
comfortable after several caps on the
regulated<00:00:36.660> side<00:00:38.149> basically<00:00:39.149> what<00:00:39.390> happens<00:00:39.719> is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
regulated side basically what happens is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.040 
regulated side basically what happens is
i<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.170> only<00:00:41.270> one<00:00:42.270> motor<00:00:42.480> controller<00:00:42.840> hooked

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
i have only one motor controller hooked

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
i have only one motor controller hooked
up<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.230> i'm<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> show<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.890> basically

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
up so i'm going to show you basically

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.660 
up so i'm going to show you basically
how<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.030> works<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:47.780> basically<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> robot

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
how that works but basically the robot

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910 
how that works but basically the robot
got<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.270> shaky<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.230> work<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
got a little shaky because i work on a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
got a little shaky because i work on a
PID<00:00:53.250> controller<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.750> i'll<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.260> show<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
PID controller but i'll just show you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.670 
PID controller but i'll just show you
that<00:00:55.620> finding<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.190> forward<00:00:57.410> let's<00:00:58.410> say<00:00:58.530> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that finding it forward let's say it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.670 
that finding it forward let's say it
backwards<00:01:03.439> it<00:01:04.439> works<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> differential

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
backwards it works but the differential

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
backwards it works but the differential
games<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.360> portion<00:01:09.360> against<00:01:09.630> or

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
games and a portion against or

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.120 
games and a portion against or
inconsistent<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.729> should<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.210> shaken

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.730 

so<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.700> forward<00:01:18.150> goes<00:01:18.420> forward<00:01:18.810> back

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so if I so forward goes forward back

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:50.290 
so if I so forward goes forward back
backwards<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:21.619> working<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:27.140> let's<00:01:28.140> try

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.120 

come<00:01:51.300> as<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> HBO<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.890> sittin

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
come as you see I got to HBO just sittin

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.830 
come as you see I got to HBO just sittin
down<00:01:53.190> there<00:01:53.870> when<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:54.900> there's<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.650> fear<00:01:56.630> for<00:01:57.630> my

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
down there when I there's a fear for my

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.550 
down there when I there's a fear for my
life<00:01:57.870> ugh<00:01:58.680> engines<00:01:59.310> little<00:02:00.270> safety<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
life ugh engines little safety so the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
life ugh engines little safety so the
fact<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.160> show<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.430> off<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:04.170> my

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
fact over here show it off I have my

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.580 
fact over here show it off I have my
wireless<00:02:04.710> transmitters<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
wireless transmitters up here like I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.139 
wireless transmitters up here like I
said<00:02:07.650> regulated<00:02:08.220> side<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.970> 2<00:02:09.119> h's

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
said regulated side and the 2 h's

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.290 
said regulated side and the 2 h's
bridges<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.869> inside<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.150> can

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
bridges get inside and in there you can

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.040 
bridges get inside and in there you can
see<00:02:12.570> him<00:02:12.810> down<00:02:13.020> there<00:02:14.390> really<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.720> no<00:02:18.050> other

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
see him down there really is no other

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.760 
see him down there really is no other
than<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:20.180> start<00:02:21.180> working<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.170> going

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
than that start working on so I'm going

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.580 
than that start working on so I'm going
to<00:02:22.830> put<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> integral<00:02:23.520> portion<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> PID

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
to put a integral portion into the PID

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.470 
to put a integral portion into the PID
right<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> PD<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.610> said<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
right now it's just a PD like I said and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.229 
right now it's just a PD like I said and
after<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.530> should<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:29.030> balancing<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.150> my

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
after that I should be balancing on my

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.370 
after that I should be balancing on my
own<00:02:30.390> two<00:02:30.540> feet<00:02:30.570> i'm<00:02:30.900> going<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.080> finish<00:02:31.200> up

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
own two feet i'm going to finish up

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.660 
own two feet i'm going to finish up
another<00:02:31.650> motor<00:02:31.830> controller<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.489> wheel

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
another motor controller for this wheel

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.980 
another motor controller for this wheel
and<00:02:32.880> I've<00:02:33.840> yet<00:02:34.050> thanks<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:34.950> watching
