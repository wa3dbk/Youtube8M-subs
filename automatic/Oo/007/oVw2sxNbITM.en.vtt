00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
ball pretty easily but yeah I decided to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.420

pretty<00:00:50.610> stupid<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.239> anyway<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> decided<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.440> go

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
pretty stupid but anyway I decided to go

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
pretty stupid but anyway I decided to go
on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> attack<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.460> lose<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> ball<00:00:53.879> straight

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
on the attack we lose the ball straight

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
on the attack we lose the ball straight
away<00:00:54.390> he<00:00:54.600> goes<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> counter-attack<00:00:55.440> once

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

away he goes on the counter-attack once
again<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.370> pressed<00:00:56.969> B<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> guess<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.379> we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
again I pressed B and guess what we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
again I pressed B and guess what we
actually<00:00:58.829> cave<00:00:59.309> away<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> penalty<00:01:00.109> straight

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

after we conceded our first goal and
yeah<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.449> makes<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.809> 2-1<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> terrible

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
get another chance we do cleared away

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
get another chance we do cleared away
but<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.729> he<00:01:47.820> had<00:01:48.000> sit<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.630> tried<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but then he had sit back I tried to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
but then he had sit back I tried to
clear<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> away<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.890> once<00:01:50.130> again<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> pressed

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
clear it away there once again I pressed

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 
clear it away there once again I pressed
X<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.530> stupid<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.009> probably

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
X and it was just so stupid I probably

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.260 
X and it was just so stupid I probably
should<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.490> pressed<00:01:53.759> B<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
should have pressed B because that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.240 
should have pressed B because that
Kolker<00:01:54.899> wouldn't<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.350> done<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.950> slide

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
Kolker wouldn't have done the the slide

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
Kolker wouldn't have done the the slide
tackle<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:57.180> he<00:01:57.780> picks<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.110> another

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
tackle so again he picks up another

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
tackle so again he picks up another
penalty<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.100> makes<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> three<00:01:59.939> hunted<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
penalty and makes it three hunted it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.990 
penalty and makes it three hunted it
worse<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.140> us<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.799> yeah<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> terrible

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000

across I tried to block it off with my

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.390 
across I tried to block it off with my
defender<00:04:20.260> but<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.470> was<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:20.980> bit<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> little

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
defender but I was a little bit a little

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.980 
defender but I was a little bit a little
bit<00:04:21.609> too<00:04:21.729> were<00:04:21.910> too<00:04:22.150> late<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.390> guess<00:04:22.690> with<00:04:22.870> it

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
bit too were too late I guess with it

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.570 
bit too were too late I guess with it
with<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.200> slide<00:04:23.410> cycle<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:23.890> he<00:04:23.979> makes<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.310> for

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
with the slide cycle so he makes it for

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.760 
with the slide cycle so he makes it for
four<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.360> make<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.660> all<00:04:25.870> even<00:04:26.110> then<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.680> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
four to make it all even then in the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.690 
four to make it all even then in the
second<00:04:27.100> off<00:04:27.190> we<00:04:27.310> try<00:04:27.490> to
