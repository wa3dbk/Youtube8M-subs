they're<00:01:32.470> all<00:01:32.590> pretty<00:01:32.770> different<00:01:33.070> from<00:01:33.400> these

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
they're all pretty different from these

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.930 
they're all pretty different from these
ones<00:01:34.540> right<00:01:34.840> here<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:36.130> can<00:01:36.310> tell<00:01:36.490> like<00:01:36.520> I

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.080 
think they put a lot more effort into
these<00:01:38.620> ones<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.130> make<00:01:39.250> them<00:01:39.400> look<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.610> bit<00:01:39.940> more

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
YouTube of this because it's quite rare

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.460 
YouTube of this because it's quite rare
that<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.220> find<00:02:57.250> level<00:02:57.670> 50<00:02:58.000> clan<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.600> it's

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
that you find level 50 clan and it's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.330 
that you find level 50 clan and it's
