and<00:01:52.420> hit<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> ground<00:01:52.869> running<00:01:53.049> now<00:01:54.010> tell<00:01:54.220> us

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
and hit the ground running now tell us

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.920 
and hit the ground running now tell us
about<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.670> new<00:01:54.820> inclination<00:01:55.299> monitor

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
about the new inclination monitor

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.930 
about the new inclination monitor
yeah<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.680> inclination<00:01:56.950> monitor<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.790> now

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
yeah the inclination monitor is now

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.910 
yeah the inclination monitor is now
standard<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:59.080> really<00:01:59.229> just<00:01:59.470> brings<00:01:59.680> in

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
standard and it really just brings in

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.010 
standard and it really just brings in
more<00:02:00.310> information<00:02:00.640> for<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.360> operators<00:02:01.840> to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
more information for the operators to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.690 
more information for the operators to
improve<00:02:02.350> their<00:02:02.530> dosing<00:02:02.920> efficiency<00:02:03.549> and

improve their dosing efficiency and
understand<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.299> terrain<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.869> they're<00:02:05.049> in

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
understand the terrain that they're in

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.410 
understand the terrain that they're in
ok<00:02:06.189> what<00:02:06.340> about<00:02:06.520> some<00:02:06.640> technology<00:02:06.909> updates

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
ok what about some technology updates

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.759 
ok what about some technology updates
anything<00:02:07.780> that'll<00:02:07.960> help<00:02:07.990> miners<00:02:08.379> get<00:02:08.590> more

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
anything that'll help miners get more

improve efficiency as well new operators
like<00:02:19.000> them<00:02:19.209> because<00:02:19.420> they

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
like them because they

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.350 
like them because they
become<00:02:20.020> more<00:02:20.320> efficient<00:02:20.800> faster<00:02:21.640> now<00:02:22.330> that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
become more efficient faster now that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.030 
become more efficient faster now that
these<00:02:22.630> really<00:02:22.840> help<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> new<00:02:23.320> operators<00:02:23.740> get

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
these really help the new operators get

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.190 
these really help the new operators get
acclimated<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.790> machine<00:02:25.270> they<00:02:25.750> do<00:02:25.810> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
acclimated to the machine they do and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.200 
acclimated to the machine they do and
older<00:02:26.470> operators<00:02:27.010> seasoned<00:02:27.760> operators

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
older operators seasoned operators

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.700 
older operators seasoned operators
actually<00:02:28.600> like<00:02:28.780> them<00:02:28.960> as<00:02:29.110> well<00:02:29.260> because<00:02:29.590> it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
actually like them as well because it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.040 
actually like them as well because it
helps<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.040> reduce<00:02:30.310> their<00:02:30.520> workload<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.240> course

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
helps to reduce their workload of course

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.390 
helps to reduce their workload of course
the<00:02:32.170> other<00:02:32.320> big<00:02:32.500> technology<00:02:32.770> story<00:02:33.250> is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the other big technology story is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.550 
the other big technology story is
command<00:02:33.880> for<00:02:34.120> dozing<00:02:34.600> why<00:02:35.080> would<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.350> want<00:02:35.500> to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
command for dozing why would you want to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.830 
command for dozing why would you want to
run<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.740> d<00:02:35.920> 11<00:02:36.190> t<00:02:36.220> remotely<00:02:36.700> yeah<00:02:37.390> just<00:02:37.690> think

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
run a d 11 t remotely yeah just think

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.960 
run a d 11 t remotely yeah just think
about<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.230> environments<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.250> these<00:02:39.490> dozers

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
about the environments that these dozers

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.150 
about the environments that these dozers
work<00:02:40.240> in<00:02:40.480> say<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.050> had<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.410> clean<00:02:41.620> up<00:02:41.650> under<00:02:42.130> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
work in say you had to clean up under a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.060 
work in say you had to clean up under a
collapsed<00:02:42.610> high<00:02:42.910> wall<00:02:43.150> or<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.870> had<00:02:44.070> scooped

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
collapsed high wall or you had scooped

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.010 
collapsed high wall or you had scooped
up<00:02:45.220> radioactive<00:02:45.940> materials<00:02:46.450> or<00:02:46.660> work<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
up radioactive materials or work in a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.170 
up radioactive materials or work in a
very<00:02:47.140> dusty<00:02:47.680> environment<00:02:48.520> or<00:02:48.670> even<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:49.000> very

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
very dusty environment or even a very

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.030 
very dusty environment or even a very
steep<00:02:49.600> slope<00:02:49.630> or<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.500> want<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.680> work<00:02:50.770> at<00:02:50.890> home

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
steep slope or you want to work at home

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.810 
steep slope or you want to work at home
in<00:02:51.280> your<00:02:51.370> pajamas

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
in your pajamas

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.500 
in your pajamas
maybe<00:02:52.420> some<00:02:52.780> day<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.239> role<00:02:55.390> control

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
maybe some day so the role control

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.300 
maybe some day so the role control
system<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.050> hard<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.260> learn<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:57.100> not

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
system is that hard to learn it's not

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.860 
system is that hard to learn it's not
hard<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.640> learn<00:02:57.760> at<00:02:57.970> all<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.300> controls<00:02:58.720> are

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
hard to learn at all the controls are

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.420 
hard to learn at all the controls are
very<00:02:58.900> intuitive<00:02:59.410> because<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.220> same

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
very intuitive because of the same

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.310 
very intuitive because of the same
controls<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.120> are<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.360> our<00:03:01.480> cab<00:03:01.750> it's

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
controls that are in our cab it's

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.080 
controls that are in our cab it's
actually<00:03:02.709> fun<00:03:02.920> I've<00:03:03.489> got<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.700> think<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.910> also

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
actually fun I've got to think that also

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.330 
actually fun I've got to think that also
helps<00:03:04.420> attract<00:03:04.840> those<00:03:05.230> operators<00:03:06.100> we're

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
helps attract those operators we're

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.949 
helps attract those operators we're
talking<00:03:06.610> about<00:03:06.700> sure<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.480> Nintendo

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
talking about sure the Nintendo

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.050 
talking about sure the Nintendo
operators<00:03:08.560> know<00:03:08.770> exactly<00:03:09.190> how<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.430> use<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.880> but

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
operators know exactly how to use it but

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.300 
operators know exactly how to use it but
the<00:03:10.570> older<00:03:10.840> operators<00:03:11.320> like<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.770> too<00:03:11.950> because

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the older operators like it too because

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.890 
the older operators like it too because
then<00:03:12.489> they<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.820> get<00:03:12.940> out<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.390> dust<00:03:13.660> and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
then they can get out of the dust and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900 
then they can get out of the dust and
the<00:03:14.050> vibration<00:03:14.590> environments<00:03:15.220> well<00:03:15.760> with

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the vibration environments well with

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.190 
the vibration environments well with
command<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.270> dosing<00:03:16.540> we're<00:03:16.660> making<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.930> great

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
command for dosing we're making a great

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.620 
command for dosing we're making a great
machine<00:03:17.410> even<00:03:18.130> better<00:03:18.370> we<00:03:18.850> do<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.300> with<00:03:19.450> that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
machine even better we do and with that

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.210 
machine even better we do and with that
command<00:03:19.989> for<00:03:20.140> dosing<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.709> don't<00:03:20.860> even<00:03:21.010> need

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
command for dosing you don't even need

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.190 
command for dosing you don't even need
to<00:03:21.280> stand<00:03:21.610> outside<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.180> operate<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:23.050> can

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
to stand outside to operate it you can

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.990 
to stand outside to operate it you can
take<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.530> console<00:03:23.980> inside<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.370> warm<00:03:24.670> pickup
