so<00:00:57.389> you<00:00:57.479> can<00:00:57.539> tighten<00:00:57.959> this<00:00:58.049> up<00:00:58.229> or<00:00:58.709> four

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
so you can tighten this up or four

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.559 
so you can tighten this up or four

other<00:01:03.149> crown<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.719> them<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.540> speed<00:01:06.810> shift

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
other crown of them so the speed shift

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.410 
other crown of them so the speed shift
system<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.830> showed<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.100> comes<00:01:08.940> on<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.270> off

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
system as I showed you comes on and off

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810 
system as I showed you comes on and off
so<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> shield<00:01:10.170> snaps<00:01:10.440> into<00:01:10.710> place<00:01:10.820> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
so that the shield snaps into place this

so that the shield snaps into place this
has<00:01:12.060> an<00:01:12.270> additional<00:01:12.690> feature<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.590> where

has an additional feature here where

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
has an additional feature here where
it's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> locking<00:01:14.820> mechanism<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it's a locking mechanism in which you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.550 
it's a locking mechanism in which you
can<00:01:16.260> lock<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.130> shield<00:01:17.370> in<00:01:17.550> place<00:01:17.580> an<00:01:18.560> open
