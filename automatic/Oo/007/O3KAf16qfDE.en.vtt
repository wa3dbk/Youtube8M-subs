00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 so today the studio will crash test 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 original huavei touch glass 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:15.780
 honor 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:17.699
 glass has been extracted from parsing the keys all 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.480
 understand what happens the most interesting 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:27.599
 all mine often and so on basically 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 I make an effort well, the glass is not 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.750
 Scratch everything with it is normal to spit 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.750
 I think not even really needed 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.219
 everything is equal there is no use 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.219
 ordinary pintsetik not particularly sharp 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.739
 too wright greenhouses it is quite difficult 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.600
 quietly did not appear use so 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:28.260
 better 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:33.800
 the parsing tool doesn't scratch yet 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.800
 more rigid and sharp and then my 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.210
 put a lot of effort into me 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210
 scratched 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:16.090
 sharp that's how the instrument drunk not 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:16.090
 scratches the legs too pretty 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.520
 Well, at least you do not scratch burst 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.200
 There are absolutely no scratches even glass 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.930
 very soft my bends in all 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.660
 the sides that is when the fall is yes in theory 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.210
 she falls like that and so on 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.930
 the glass of you may bend a little and not 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:59.040
 crack guests don't even know what its 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:12.330
 break here we can take such a coast 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:23.760
 the tag is also not beating 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:29.330
 scratched so here the only thing 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.330
 Screwdriver leaves small mitts 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.150
 very small I think what to scratch 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.489
 This is a glass that you need to scratch 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.170
 I don't know very well Panin 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.170
 bricks or whatever here
