00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:10.420
 and then table galley today's statement 21 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.150
 16 and 21 13 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.890
 I'm going to make a video today to give a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:21.400
 strength of the people who like to play like 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.909
 workshop of 37 that sometimes has to change 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.409
 guitar tuning and has no more than 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:30.099
 that a guitar to keep changing 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:32.829
 tuning in there is that the ropes are played 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:37.210
 Sometimes it hurts faster It wakes up at 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:40.390
 Sometimes the guy heads or does not look good. 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.480
 difficult to set at the beginning is 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.559
 so it starts as soon as it rode then 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.219
 I'm going to make a brief video lesson here. 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:57.039
 in order to teach you trick here in 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:59.739
 blue stone already one x next or in own g1 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:04.330
 next also the streets give to you 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.370
 get it done now position yourself 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:20.380
 that's right 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:24.160
 listen for the sound of the language I'm going 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.780
 I'm going to put this ok button in a 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:41.590
 module ii tea 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:45.040
 I'm going to change here until 99 the beginning I'm going 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.740
 do the following in the center here 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.690
 Duct means you're in the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:57.280
 center of original normal tuning 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:03.580
 nuno tomÃ¡s moro guitar every digit that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 appears here but - lisa 1 cm on 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.490
 so if I want to raise the tone of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 guitar 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.840
 see what will happen here 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.630
 increased half step that is the tone seeb 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 capital would be basically after all 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.470
 inflation 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.900
 now I'll put it here 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.680
 this is the way people who 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.240
 they play music of the gas for example 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 need to use which would be 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.820
 below or a segment below 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.820
 I can put 1 - 1 there you can take 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.240
 and there are some songs from the g3 workshop that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.110
 they use to avoid deceased now in the latter 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.470
 cd they are not tuned a tone down 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.500
 or 2 m tones years and after the war 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:28.170
 for example they use two shades 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.170
 below that is 4 semitones right 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.960
 when I do it I do not need tinkering 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.150
 in the wiring of the direct guitar here in the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.280
 my rates I can leave the same 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.690
 The way the ropes are, I will not stay. 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.570
 Molengas, right? 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.940
 especially if you play with the rope 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:56.140
 09 using the behavior 10 10 11 is 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.690
 even if it lowered the tone 12 tom e ne I 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.820
 two- tone down one 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.440
 limp strings only playgrounds 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:10.650
 wake up 09 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.650
 they will look like a prof 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.440
 Now to show you, they 'll put 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.440
 a brief here 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:43.289
 it's the demonstration 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.210
 now normal 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.500
 We then closed down just to do this 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.130
 video should there but we get very 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.800
 Time, people, I already think of you. 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.580
 Jesus to each one of you 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.790
 I hope this tip is good now 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.150
 It is useful for you who use this 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.150
 true
