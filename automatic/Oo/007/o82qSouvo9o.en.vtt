00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
I'm assuming that they're positioning

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.390 
I'm assuming that they're positioning
those<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.260> when<00:02:17.350> your<00:02:17.500> hands<00:02:17.890> go<00:02:18.040> over<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
those that when your hands go over the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.120 
those that when your hands go over the
sides<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.390> kind<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.810> cups<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> sound<00:02:20.650> rather

sides it kind of cups the sound rather

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.449 
sides it kind of cups the sound rather
than<00:02:21.400> having<00:02:21.670> them<00:02:21.910> come<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> front

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
than having them come out of the front

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.320 
than having them come out of the front
also<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:25.980> left<00:02:26.980> side<00:02:27.100> here<00:02:27.610> we<00:02:27.790> have<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
rocker the power button is curiously up

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.699

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
on the top left here although makes it

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.550 
on the top left here although makes it
easier<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.310> not<00:02:48.489> bump<00:02:48.850> into<00:02:49.209> randomly<00:02:49.750> we'd

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
easier to not bump into randomly we'd

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.259 
easier to not bump into randomly we'd
probably<00:02:50.799> prefer<00:02:51.190> if<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.459> was<00:02:51.580> over<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
probably prefer if it was over on the

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.720 
probably prefer if it was over on the
left<00:02:53.170> or<00:02:53.319> right<00:02:53.350> side<00:02:53.739> somewhere<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.579> could

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
left or right side somewhere you could

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.630 
left or right side somewhere you could
actually<00:02:55.410> hit<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.470> simply<00:02:56.980> especially

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
actually hit it simply especially

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.300 
actually hit it simply especially
because<00:02:57.910> it's<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.570> not<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> very<00:02:59.079> big<00:02:59.310> very

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
because it's it's not a very big very

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.650 
because it's it's not a very big very
big<00:03:00.400> button<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.290> aside<00:03:02.579> on<00:03:03.579> the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
big button so all that aside on the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.770 
big button so all that aside on the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
internals we're looking at Tegra 3 which

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.580 
internals we're looking at Tegra 3 which
is<00:03:07.810> last<00:03:08.079> year's<00:03:08.200> processor<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.910> still

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
is last year's processor but it still

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.930 
is last year's processor but it still
performs<00:03:11.590> very<00:03:12.010> well<00:03:12.070> especially<00:03:12.549> with<00:03:12.820> this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
performs very well especially with this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.250 
performs very well especially with this
lower<00:03:13.150> resolution<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.810> doesn't<00:03:13.989> have<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.140> lot

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
lower resolution it doesn't have a lot

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.979 
lower resolution it doesn't have a lot
