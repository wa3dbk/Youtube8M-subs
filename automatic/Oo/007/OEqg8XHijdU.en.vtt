00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 Hello again 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.859
 Today we have a third 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.189
 hit technique 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.189
 elbows and knees are considered bc 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.679
 more terrible weapon 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.109
 distinctly percussion technique not 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.170
 used elbows and knees 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.520
 I do not think that special 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 very traumatic 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 power strike technique 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.430
 the same principle as the rub 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.430
 only 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.900
 the other day straighten 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.270
 we press the expert 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.960
 sociologists 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.260
 let's start with the side 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.420
 elbow punch 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.130
 all affairs on the support zone 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.540
 same with port 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 twist the body insert so close 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.910
 in his opinion 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.900
 the volume is at his jaw level 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.800
 szfo 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.660
 there are several ways we will look 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.630
 first stage 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 chery whites 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.020
 and the second way is a backhand 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480
 sand 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.710
 and europe 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.070
 the hunter is pure 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.940
 it is instant visit 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.270
 except we fill the class the enemy is not capable 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 adequately see 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 and almost victory in the ass 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.820
 but us points 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 clearly insert 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.860
 and right is better the same 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.620
 lateral to jaw 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 body audit 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 and top 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.159
 Now consider direct elbow strikes. 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.159
 us and shared the accident failure 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.689
 nature smile he 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.029
 performed 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.029
 punch with mass ask 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.739
 adversary 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.309
 david gill 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.949
 For example, for the enemy 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.949
 closed between the gloves between 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.019
 hit face punch nose 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.709
 it's very scary 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.709
 quite dramatic and can be tilted 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.139
 and performed with the conclusion of the same name 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:50.679
 the book 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.679
 as he assandzh all corps 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.280
 take 03 new region 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 and left and midges do 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.159
 now right straight right 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.969
 if you are standing in a tree 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.219
 you will need to take a step right 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.219
 hand before 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.279
 back right 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.459
 in Tokyo 100 thousand 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.859
 these are the basic techniques 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.589
 in the army act that we use 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.249
 there are also others we will consider them 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.769
 next st 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.209
 no more complicated 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.459
 for basic equipment it will be enough 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.359
 flexible 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.419
 handed to colleagues 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.549
 don't let me run 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.099
 practically no front kick only we 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.409
 apply new 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.409
 but taxa sport itself 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.259
 volume right knee 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.599
 punching 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.369
 Eva Bushmina 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:02.369
 raised knees 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.989
 body try we could not break through 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.889
 yes you live knees 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.889
 imagine the enemy 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.169
 like the right knee 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.169
 we are for growing coca 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.909
 in melee 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:48.949
 knee strikes 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.909
 controlled by the inside 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.050
 so let's old fashioned 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 with an adversary 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.400
 he changes court r 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.759
 meaning began to rise 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.759
 to steam level 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.039
 inside 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.039
 as fast as low countries 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.939
 and true 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.559
 knee strikes 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.270
 the main 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.499
 I showed you 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.489
 You can also perform them in motion. 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:31.930
 jump 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.969
 stock charm 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.050
 this is all we will consider further 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.759
 more complicated technique you need to learn this 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.969
 the base 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.800
 for today at Roshka 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.129
 finished 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.770
 all the best to the next
