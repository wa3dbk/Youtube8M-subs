00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:15.120
 Now, when you show this brand movie, the brand is integrated. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.369
 What kind of evolution is there in the new rabbi 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.000
 You can talk to Mr. Matsumoto, I guess that digital device smartphone or 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.550
 If you eat it with your tablet and voice , it's by spreading it a lot 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.930
 That 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.949
 It is said that it is said that we became, but we that nec passer 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.199
 It's a computer , so I think it's not enough yet . Real digital. 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:40.000
 Society is more convenient and more comfortable 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:43.030
 You should believe in Fu say Do not want to make such a living space is 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.540
 We do not have enough still that still not enough 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.090
 Road cubic calculation still more 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.730
 Not enough 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:58.809
 I think the item is like a friend, but I've decided it, sir 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:02.170
 Mr. Matsumoto What kind of convenience comes from the digital society of this idea? 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.110
 Also really Have you the last time it is though is what as I was allowed that story is 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 Digital devices Hey house is also the restored teachings of manners 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.310
 It's a lot of shakes and closets. 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.940
 I I think that analog content of that said, that's hwabyeong tape is full of remains 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 Well then, it is said that there are those who are up in the cloud 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.620
 But 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.100
 It is our investigation Well, in the picture of Ambi that person is saved 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:30.390
 This is about 3% of the data 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.140
 Shiya tablet was not only hardware but also such software 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.290
 App 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:43.259
 And we suggest our customers to be aware of these things and change the digital life 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.759
 Well , if it is the rabbi that we are making to realize this, we want to embody the add-on brand 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.090
 I think in the wind 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.729
 Specifically, 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:56.730
 Just you that what such a thing Well is for that software and applications 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.850
 I introduced it , but in software ai info boat then 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.390
 When 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.740
 my time line then my history 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.040
 Then b voice is getting faster and faster without getting such software 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.280
 Ne 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:16.030
 We are announcing that we will have a TV show like this from now on 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.840
 In particular, it is the want to we proposed but I know that info board that TV 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.860
 In seen in the recently this Tsuke' Panashi 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.709
 This kind of It's a guy that look over while also I I think that some people that say no 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.440
 It is a broken PC in Taiwan 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.190
 I say that music and news program, and it is such a news information 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.739
 is not it 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.860
 If you can access that only when there is information you like in 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.690
 I wonder if it will change 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.920
 It is a part of life that I think in a way like that 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:52.530
 I thought it was this very simple and easy to understand 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.670
 If this is a little PC is not good I wonder if that good people can use it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.850
 I think 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:05.200
 How about a shield? I want to use it already. 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:07.540
 This is to Carry anywhere because actually have those very light also such a public 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 Cloud of do or Sobijinu of maybe 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.700
 I think there will be many people who say it's a little difficult and you do n't know what to do 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.110
 Right 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:28.550

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:31.670

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.850

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.240
 Such being 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:50.320

 cm You saw the making of the shooting 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.160
 There was a scene that shooting was floating in the air or blown by intense wind. 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.870
 How was the shooting 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:19.590
 8 It was a strange shooting site 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:26.910
 I'm not saying that Tsu amazing slow motion I do not is about time motion 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:33.090
 It was such a great subtle movement that there was touching hunting such as photography of 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.630
 Also to match it lend and or contains the camera moving at a speed of only long as it is a close after 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.770
 I was desperate 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:45.460
 It was a very anxious shooting site 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:49.840
 The camera was doing a great movement like the arm of a very special robot 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.830

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.650
