00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.810 
process of putting on our side wind
deflectors<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.900> go<00:00:22.080> ahead<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.820> insert

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
deflectors is to go ahead and insert

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.359 
deflectors is to go ahead and insert
them<00:00:24.029> into<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.570> channel<00:00:25.189> where<00:00:26.189> they're

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
them into the channel where they're

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.419 
them into the channel where they're
going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.930> placed<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.250> want

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to be placed and then what we want

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.550 
going to be placed and then what we want
to<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.060> once<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.779> sitting<00:00:31.470> up

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to do is once we get them sitting up

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.190 
to do is once we get them sitting up
here<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:32.820> ahead<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.149> pull<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> red<00:00:33.690> tape<00:00:33.960> off

here go ahead and pull the red tape off
now<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> tape<00:00:38.010> off<00:00:38.809> we're

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
now that we have the tape off we're

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
now that we have the tape off we're
going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.140> ahead<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> fit<00:00:41.340> our<00:00:41.760> side<00:00:42.180> wind

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
going to go ahead and fit our side wind

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.470 
going to go ahead and fit our side wind
deflector<00:00:43.129> up<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> channel<00:00:47.270> just<00:00:48.270> kind

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
deflector up into the channel just kind

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
deflector up into the channel just kind
of<00:00:48.539> run<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.840> finger<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.410> take<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.890> fingers

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
of run our finger in take your fingers

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
of run our finger in take your fingers
and<00:00:50.340> run<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.820> around<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> inside<00:00:52.280> just

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and run them around on the inside just

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
and run them around on the inside just
with<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> little<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> firm<00:00:54.239> pressure<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
with a little bit of firm pressure to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.790 
with a little bit of firm pressure to
help<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.590> tape<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> adhere<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
help the tape to it adhere to the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.490 
help the tape to it adhere to the
channel<00:00:59.930> then<00:01:00.930> we'll<00:01:01.109> take<00:01:01.320> our<00:01:01.500> spacer

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 

in<00:01:05.070> case<00:01:05.340> you're<00:01:05.520> wondering<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.240> are

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
in case you're wondering what these are

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.380 
in case you're wondering what these are
for<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.980> actually<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.550> go<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.150> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
for these are actually to go in here so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.320 
for these are actually to go in here so
it<00:01:09.840> helps<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.230> window<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.740> past<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:12.000> corner

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it helps the window get past this corner

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
it helps the window get past this corner
of<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.840> side<00:01:13.110> wind<00:01:13.530> deflector<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of the side wind deflector so that it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.000 
of the side wind deflector so that it
doesn't<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.450> caught<00:01:15.660> on<00:01:15.870> there<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.350> pull<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
doesn't get caught on there and pull it

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.800 
doesn't get caught on there and pull it
out<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:18.360> we'll<00:01:18.480> take<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:20.240> place<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.480> up<00:01:21.630> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
out then we'll take that place it up in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.860 
out then we'll take that place it up in
corner<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.980> here<00:01:25.880> push<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> back<00:01:27.300> in<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.780> as

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
corner up here push it back in there as

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.450 
corner up here push it back in there as
far<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:30.860> okay<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.160> we'll<00:01:32.340> go

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
far as we can get it okay now we'll go

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.810 
far as we can get it okay now we'll go

get<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:44.600> into<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.020> channel<00:01:48.640> we're<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:49.670> up

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
get this into the channel we're going up

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.320 
get this into the channel we're going up
in<00:01:50.090> there<00:01:50.890> our<00:01:51.890> finger<00:01:52.400> crossed<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.940> inside

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
in there our finger crossed the inside

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.050 
in there our finger crossed the inside
to<00:01:53.570> press<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.140> really<00:01:54.500> well<00:01:54.820> we'll<00:01:55.820> take

to press it in really well we'll take

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.580 
to press it in really well we'll take
our<00:01:56.270> clip<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.870> insert<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.740> into<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.130> channel

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
our clip and insert it into the channel

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.080 
our clip and insert it into the channel
what<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.620> do<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.250> take<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.820> flat

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
what I do is I just take the flat

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.060 
what I do is I just take the flat
screwdriver<00:02:02.480> because<00:02:03.290> these<00:02:03.650> are<00:02:03.800> kind<00:02:04.010> of

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
screwdriver because these are kind of

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.610 
screwdriver because these are kind of
tough<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.490> get<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.990> go<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.410> center

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
tough to get in I just go in the center

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.480 
tough to get in I just go in the center
of<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.040> just<00:02:07.880> push<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.300> back<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.690> there<00:02:09.460> okay

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
of it just push it back in there okay

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.640 
of it just push it back in there okay
now<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.880> process<00:02:11.450> for<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.900> other<00:02:12.260> side<00:02:12.440> of

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
now the process for the other side of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.620 
now the process for the other side of
the<00:02:12.800> vehicle<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.250> exactly<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.060> same<00:02:14.270> as<00:02:14.480> we

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the vehicle is exactly the same as we

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.780 
the vehicle is exactly the same as we
did<00:02:14.660> here<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:16.160> will<00:02:16.370> complete<00:02:16.760> our

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
did here so this will complete our

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.600 
did here so this will complete our
installation
