00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
 how 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.370
 ah 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.660
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 playing one is easier 4 but in this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.529
 case I'm playing in the client or in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.029
 the cti servers as you already know 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.250
 once in a while I like to bring them buzz 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.960
 so let's say by showing them or telling them 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
 of the updates but in this case 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 I want to do something more like a debate one 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 conversation between you and me let's say 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.279
 I'm not looking at any gameplay now 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.079
 that I have on the screen so I am 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.669
 talking to the wall is basically not 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.710
 I have no written script about 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.570
 things that I want to talk about on time 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 let's say but something that I would like to do 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.110
 before starting the comment is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 ask you to do in the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 comment section if they want between 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 I do not know one or three points of things anymore 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.310
 important that they would like to see 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.900
 changed since we are waiting for a 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.730
 great patch for the month of September in 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.530
 which is only a week from 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.060
 the day that I'm recording this let's say and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.130
 probably they will get it out of the 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
 half since September some Tuesday 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.460
 they always take out the updates 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.140
 so maybe we're seeing something of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.090
 about three weeks let's say for 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 that a patch comes out which is supposed 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.259
 that will change and fix a lot 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.939
 game things for those who do not know or 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.310
 they have not heard anything let's say they are not 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.810
 maybe they are aware of some of the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.250
 things some of the points or the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.760
 things that have decided to change in the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.730
 client 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.320
 you go from the damage of weapons what 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.410
 they have changed in a very small way 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.030
 animations of the characters in forms 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.290
 in which the character moves by 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.730
 example have they put the way how they 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 they move the characters as they hit 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.270
 filters and so react in a way 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.460
 faster to what we give them 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.710
 let's say let's say it's a little more agile not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 they are faster they do not run faster 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 as happened in a version of 7 in the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.060
 which was a little hand with the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 movement speed but that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 respond in a more agile way to what 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 that we ordered them to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 do they have changed the looks have 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 changed the visual retrogression that no longer 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.280
 exists 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.470
 they have changed setbacks of truth in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.870
 some weapons have balanced some 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.630
 weapons and we have changed vehicle maps 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.770
 balance a lot of things I'm not going to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.300
 put together a list now because it would be 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.250
 endless would be half an hour talking 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.110
 but after having played during 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 several hours in the client on the 7th 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.710
 taken a few games let's say yes 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.119
 well I did not agree at all 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.380
 the changes that have decided to be me 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.790
 obviously some of those changes do not 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 they will be once the patch comes out 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.530
 many have been a developer by 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.480
 example pulls an idea that I'm throwing 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.080
 a random example no longer has an idea 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.290
 to change a weapon always 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.630
 for 123 days a week the community 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.430
 he says no for this I'm this you see that the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.690
 vast majority of people say we say no 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.610
 this is a great violence becomes 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.230
 backwards it's something very good let's say the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.120
 community is very involved with respect 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.410
 to the changes that are being made and the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.710
 people that are there is pretty enough 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.960
 seen from seen so 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.580
 comments very specific posts of 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.110
 why some things work out why 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.970
 others not that would have to be changed 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.200
 many but many suggestions for 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.420
 example one of the changes that I do not 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.610
 I liked it was that the damage of 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.560
 what are automatic weapons for a 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.090
 point you good some will say no 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.590
 long ago the difference others 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.570
 will complain as for example I that 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.870
 it could become the game too 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.850
 fluid too fast let's say and that is 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.560
 fly a little less tactical for example 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.350
 one of the questions I asked him 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.730
 developer was how are you going to be that 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.430
 flanked an enemy and grab him by 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.650
 back, worth more once we have a 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.660
 let's say minor damage since I'm giving it 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.459
 more time for my enemy to react 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.080
 turn around and ruin me flanked 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.660
 that I put together while more damage 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.650
 we have more more I'm going to benefit by 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.370
 that postage 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.170
 obviously what he answered was that 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.269
 I think it was that I had to go more for 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.549
 shots to the head that I was going to take 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.900
 greater benefits I went simply by 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.030
 shots to the head on the occasion of 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.470
 be reduced the damage obviously after 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.150
 this was changing and now the damage 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.629
 it's only reduced in what they are 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.400
 combats of 12 meters 12 of 15 meters 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.319
 down let's say in what was 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.599
 too close and what it has 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.940
 been fixed from the net code and fluency 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.250
 of the game that has decided increased already 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.780
 almost not notice, let's try to try more or 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 least keep the same time for 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.500
 kill or to be killed let's say what 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.209
 that is in the normal client but 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.280
 adapting to the new fluidity of 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.870
 I play one of the many examples as 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.730
 I tell them I would like to hear a lot that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.500
 you think because obviously I 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.329
 I can also go to the cti I can afford 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.859
 some of his ideas that pull some of 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.690
 things is always very good let's say 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.049
 share ideas and this is how it has 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.400
 armed the cti as it has been working 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.669
 obviously to all this as I say 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.500
 has been added map changes 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.270
 vehicle changes on some maps are 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.010
 has added an option so that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.110
 players have to press a button 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.639
 ready before the game starts and 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.159
 there is a 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.139
 a count on let's say there's like a minute 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.939
 waiting for not the players with 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.499
 fastest pc always have an advantage 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.349
 about the others, above all we have left 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.029
 like high rolls but on top of that and 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.860
 as I say for the third time 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.210
 I would like to hear your opinion 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.620
 forget to leave your comments below 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.879
 follow me on what are facebook and 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 twitter I'm always posting the 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.969
 videos there so they're never going to 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.349
 lose serve a bit more than youtube 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.569
 who sometimes forgets to send you my 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.219
 videos to subscribers and as always 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.389
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.389
 we see the next chau
