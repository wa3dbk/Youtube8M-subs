00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
of this so I have three stones here for

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.140 
of this so I have three stones here for
you<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.540> see<00:00:55.799> one<00:00:56.799> of<00:00:56.920> them<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.369> more<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:58.000> the

you to see one of them is more of the
light<00:00:58.629> in<00:00:59.440> terms<00:00:59.739> of<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.979> tone<00:01:00.220> another<00:01:00.729> one's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
light in terms of the tone another one's

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.119 
light in terms of the tone another one's

is going to be in a dark shade so

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.620 
is going to be in a dark shade so
there's<00:01:06.190> different<00:01:06.340> evaluations<00:01:07.180> based<00:01:07.390> on

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
there's different evaluations based on

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.830 
there's different evaluations based on
on<00:01:07.810> these<00:01:08.110> color<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:09.190> most<00:01:09.520> valuable<00:01:10.180> would

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
on these color the most valuable would

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.429 
on these color the most valuable would
be<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.229> medium<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.829> medium<00:01:12.189> dark<00:01:12.430> stone<00:01:13.329> a<00:01:14.049> lot

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
be the medium to medium dark stone a lot

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.410 
be the medium to medium dark stone a lot
of<00:01:14.560> people<00:01:14.829> kind<00:01:15.039> of<00:01:15.130> think<00:01:15.399> they're<00:01:15.640> darker

I should the darker of the stone
actually<00:01:20.829> it<00:01:21.159> gets<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.490> little<00:01:21.609> bit<00:01:21.789> more
