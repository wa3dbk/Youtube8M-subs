that there we go so here we go so what I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.980 
that there we go so here we go so what I
love<00:00:27.869> about<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> fact<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.990> can

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
love about this is the fact that I can

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
love about this is the fact that I can
I've<00:00:31.470> always<00:00:31.740> been<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> fan<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> titanfall

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
I've always been a fan of titanfall

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.270 
I've always been a fan of titanfall
since<00:00:33.559> since<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.739> been<00:00:34.860> talked<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.840> I

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
since since it's been talked of and I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
since since it's been talked of and I
like<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> idea<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:39.030> mega<00:00:39.600> giants

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
like the idea like you got mega giants

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680 
like the idea like you got mega giants
known<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.680> titans<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.489> drove<00:00:42.090> half<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> sky

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
known as titans which drove half the sky

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.600 
known as titans which drove half the sky
can<00:00:42.989> climb<00:00:43.200> into<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.649> ensure<00:00:44.010> bad<00:00:44.370> guys

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
can climb into them and ensure bad guys

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
can climb into them and ensure bad guys
or<00:00:45.000> rebels<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.960> yeah<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.530> is

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
or rebels I think it is and yeah this is

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
or rebels I think it is and yeah this is
I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> basic<00:00:51.570> version

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I think this is the basic version

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
I think this is the basic version
because<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:53.219> other<00:00:53.489> Titan

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
because you can get some other Titan

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.510 
because you can get some other Titan
versions<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
versions where that this bit where the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
versions where that this bit where the
head<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> probably<00:00:57.539> left<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> side<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
head bit is probably left on the side of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.950 
head bit is probably left on the side of
the<00:00:58.320> corner<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.489> there's<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> then

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the corner or there's some like and then

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.830 
the corner or there's some like and then
this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> giant<00:01:01.680> gun<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.010> aerial<00:01:02.840> but

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
this is like a giant gun or aerial but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.039 
this is like a giant gun or aerial but
this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.549> basic<00:01:05.549> design<00:01:05.900> which<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
this is just the basic design which I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.690 
this is just the basic design which I
love<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.979> you've<00:01:08.070> got<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.689> feet<00:01:09.689> pattern
