shoulders in the back and the muscles

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.400 
shoulders in the back and the muscles
that<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.600> gonna<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.840> working<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> you're

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that are gonna be working and you're

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
that are gonna be working and you're
pulling<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.070> transition<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
pulling and your transition in the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
pulling and your transition in the
muscle<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.750> because<00:00:28.470> after<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.949> we're<00:00:29.609> gonna

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
muscle up because after this we're gonna

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.880 
muscle up because after this we're gonna
be<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> full<00:00:30.599> muscle<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.439> exercise

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
be going to the full muscle up exercise

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
be going to the full muscle up exercise
so<00:00:32.550> you're<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.239> need<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.660> develop

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so you're gonna really need to develop

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.049 
so you're gonna really need to develop
that<00:00:34.530> strength<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> stability<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.910> take

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
that strength and stability and take

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.130 
that strength and stability and take
care<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.300> those<00:00:36.420> weaklings

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
care of those weaklings

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.630 
care of those weaklings

first<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:43.039> all<00:00:43.159> let's<00:00:43.339> look<00:00:43.399> at<00:00:43.579> some<00:00:43.730> rotator

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
first of all let's look at some rotator

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.180 
first of all let's look at some rotator
cuff<00:00:44.390> exercises<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.320> need<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.530> have<00:00:45.679> a<00:00:45.710> strong

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
cuff exercises you need to have a strong

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.130 
cuff exercises you need to have a strong
stable<00:00:46.670> rotator<00:00:47.239> cuff<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:47.659> order<00:00:47.839> to<00:00:47.929> perform

stable rotator cuff in order to perform
the<00:00:48.320> muscle<00:00:48.589> up<00:00:48.710> safely<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.249> correctly<00:00:49.370> here

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
the muscle up safely and correctly here

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:51.759 
the muscle up safely and correctly here
I'm<00:00:50.479> demonstrating<00:00:50.629> an<00:00:51.109> exercise<00:00:51.530> for

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
I'm demonstrating an exercise for

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.520 
I'm demonstrating an exercise for
internal<00:00:52.370> rotation<00:00:52.729> this<00:00:53.449> is<00:00:53.659> also<00:00:53.839> necessary

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
internal rotation this is also necessary

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.410 
internal rotation this is also necessary
during<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.949> transition<00:00:55.579> from<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:55.969> pull-up

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
during the transition from the pull-up

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.939 
during the transition from the pull-up
to<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.989> dip<00:00:58.989> keep<00:00:59.989> your<00:01:00.140> arms<00:01:00.379> bent<00:01:00.559> at<00:01:00.739> about

90<00:01:01.250> degrees<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.609> lower<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.210> bar<00:01:02.359> back

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
90 degrees and lower the bar back

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.929 
90 degrees and lower the bar back
overhead<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:03.409> then<00:01:03.469> contracting<00:01:04.460> deep<00:01:04.670> into

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
overhead and then contracting deep into

is<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.929> hinge<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.439> door<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.950> you're

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
is the hinge of a door and you're

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.830 
is the hinge of a door and you're
opening<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.939> door<00:01:43.970> outward<00:01:46.479> now<00:01:47.479> let's<00:01:47.720> look

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
opening the door outward now let's look

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.449 
opening the door outward now let's look
at<00:01:47.959> some<00:01:48.140> pulling<00:01:48.379> movements<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.009> complement

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
the muscle up the inverted row is a very

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.979 
the muscle up the inverted row is a very
good<00:01:52.280> basic<00:01:52.819> pulling<00:01:53.209> exercise<00:01:53.629> that<00:01:53.840> will

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
good basic pulling exercise that will

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.199 
good basic pulling exercise that will
strengthen<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.560> biceps<00:01:55.489> and<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.789> shoulders

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
strengthen the biceps and the shoulders

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.119 
strengthen the biceps and the shoulders
and<00:01:56.360> back<00:01:56.539> muscles<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.440> are<00:01:57.590> involved<00:01:57.800> in

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129 
and back muscles that are involved in

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:01.619 
and back muscles that are involved in
the<00:01:58.310> pulling<00:01:58.700> motion<00:01:58.849> during<00:01:59.269> the<00:01:59.479> muscle<00:01:59.780> up

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
the pulling motion during the muscle up

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.089 
the pulling motion during the muscle up
the<00:02:02.629> inverted<00:02:03.110> row<00:02:03.259> can<00:02:03.470> be<00:02:03.500> performed<00:02:04.039> using

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
the inverted row can be performed using

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.479 
the inverted row can be performed using
a<00:02:04.399> bar<00:02:04.610> or<00:02:04.879> using<00:02:05.810> straps<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:07.069> lower<00:02:07.250> your

a bar or using straps and the lower your
angle<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.179> more<00:02:08.330> challenging<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.840> becomes

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.690 

you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.890 

it's<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.790> good<00:02:20.940> idea<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.330> perform<00:02:21.480> some

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
it's a good idea to perform some

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.750 
it's a good idea to perform some
isolation<00:02:22.500> work<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.950> biceps<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.550> well

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
isolation work for the biceps as well

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.970 
isolation work for the biceps as well
and<00:02:24.060> rather<00:02:24.750> than<00:02:24.960> performing<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> using

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and rather than performing this using

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.620 
and rather than performing this using
free<00:02:26.370> weights<00:02:26.580> such<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:27.030> dumbbells<00:02:27.480> or

free weights such as dumbbells or

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
free weights such as dumbbells or
barbells<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:28.350> prefer<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> use<00:02:28.800> bodyweight

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
barbells I prefer to use bodyweight

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.400 
barbells I prefer to use bodyweight
