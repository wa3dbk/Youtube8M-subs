 the moment I have to talk to you when the

 captain asked me to become 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 the coach last year I got

 commit me I know you are a good level 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.810

 not enough to succeed you can 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.470
 Train like crazy all year round

 tokyo 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.730
 when I was little I was weak and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.470
 all the time sick I'm told that 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 the sport was not for me but 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.739
 everything changed a day in primary when 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.330
 of a class outing when we have 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.190
 watched the retransmission of the all star 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.450
 game with all the class I will not forget 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.459
 never what I felt at that moment 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.959
 there I immediately loved this sport 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.459
 awesome and from there do basketball 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.080
 was all that interested me when 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.819
 I integrated my played college club 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.110
 like a kick foot the coach does not 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.250
 did not trust and I spend the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.670
 more light of my time was shining the bench 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.220
 touch 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.230
 seriously it was pathetic then 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.450
 and I'm looking for a girlfriend 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.450

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.620
 to serve others 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.299
 so when I learned that the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.010
 first I needed reinforcement 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.900
 did not think about it and I decided to 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.069
 join the high school basketball club I 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.329
 did not think someone would take my 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.470
 speech literally it's 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.060
 crazy we can make them swallow 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.519
 anything is new we were not 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.379
 not like that we I am when it takes 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.670
 y reached 2 seconds and the girl that 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.900
 I like me said she would agree to 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.400
 go out with me at he became the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.540
 better in something like I 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.870
 did not really have a choice 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.400
 I turned to basketball the year 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.670
 last this little exercise we had 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.069
 entrusted to block for the season it could 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.439
 become a kind of tradition 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.389
 if after that I do not integrate the club at 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.489
 the less I will not regret it 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:51.230
 a touching touch 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.579
 otherwise excuse me I hate shouting you do not 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.739
 have no problem with me 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.249
 serve as a megaphone 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.249
 so you go out 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.870
 it's not true yet the horns of the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 unemployment masquerade club still a little 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 and we should have passed from us
