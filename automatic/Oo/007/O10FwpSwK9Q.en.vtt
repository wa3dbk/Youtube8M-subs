00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.070
 one learns almost every coach change 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.110
 just this very important topic 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.580
 dealing with the public that are 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.740
 of course, but also the media 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.100
 fine work done by Peter Stöger 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.700
 Also in the other groups 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.550
 club jump creates representative business 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.149
 wiberg dogs beside but also the windows 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.550
 the grandstand actually peter stöger 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:36.320
 really very well presented in 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.180
 various events just 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.550
 fruit from fanclub meeting was or that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.260
 lion was solid and that belongs to today 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.060
 trainers business absolutely right and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.440
 the second thing you have in the last 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.620
 seen how important teamwork is 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.170
 That's what you work together 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.430
 simply can delegate but needs the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 of course we just things that we now 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.000
 infuse in the talks 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.470
 It has to be aware of it always 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.579
 there is another difference if I am 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.260
 work for fk austria vienna 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.699
 international or just up 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.170
 national level for a smaller one 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.659
 club or that mean evil now 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.680
 but are just different 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.409
 requirement profiles and that would have to 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.220
 these new candidates in any case 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.390
 fulfill 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.850
 who is interested in marco 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.190
 Meilinger and already with the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.620
 player approximated player borrowed 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.479
 there are new ones from red bull salzburg 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.090
 developments 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.130
 yes, if you like, we have 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.990
 in the last days and weeks very much 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 strongly emphasizing that we have a philosophy 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.549
 we have players continue to develop 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.600
 want and that we are here on 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.000
 set austrian 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.630
 marco meilinger I someone of the kind, so to speak 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.979
 this profile would fit here 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.360
 it is so that it is true that we are 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.110
 for the player more basically 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.740
 interest 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.659
 and I have those, so to speak 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.310
 bundesliga meeting this week 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.310
 also uses with the colleague 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.930
 salzburg and the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.360
 have quite worried yes if it 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.070
 then there are conversations between 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.840
 tommy parits and ralf rangnick led 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.250
 but here is of course now 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.759
 primarily why the trainer theme 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.920
 to be seen 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.530
 this also applies to the player 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.790
 and yes we will see what they are here 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 bring next days 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.690
 but it is also clear it has to be im 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.069
 general match 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.980
 but if he meant Salzburg 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.930
 stay in salzburg then there is one 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.239
 other situation but I would say there 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370
 So what are you interested in? 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.139
 confirm that probably not conceal 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.019
 if it then comes to an agreement that 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.499
 is still some days to wait 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.730
 Finally a bit in the 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:40.680
 Waiting loop participation is based 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.099
 the now actually elapse action 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.900
 to let 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.889
 in principle belongs again 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.569
 keep monaco but roots 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.519
 right we said that this 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.620
 last half year of course for everyone 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.359
 involved network run as we do 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.359
 we hoped for that in the 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.859
 Last days has come to us 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.069
 here really just physical 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.750
 brought problems but his 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.760
 footballing classical undisputed 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.680
 so divorced that we said 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.329
 have the purchase option the oz negotiated 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.530
 was probably only we the book of action 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.159
 We had them in hand 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.319
 elapse 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.900
 this risk is too big we can 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.199
 not show but we have just 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.599
 Today talks again with 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:23.849
 his manager is doing well in the month now 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.319
 finally get feedback this week 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.299
 of course she has her mega 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.489
 Transfers from falcao started 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.620
 also in the priority list somewhere else 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.620
 the situation is unchanged that we 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.989
 under certain conditions with nasa 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.579
 parasitic continue to work that one 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.620
 parasitic here but actually continue 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.239
 wants to work and it is the question of whether 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.970
 we will find an agreement with marco 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.819
 we are in conversation that can on the one hand 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.040
 but be a fix purchase where you have but 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.599
 that minimizes the risk so to speak 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.310
 or it could very well 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.139
 that it comes once again to a loan 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.689
 with an agreed purchase option 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.060
 but that would be easy to see what 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.799
 however, the next days bring the date 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.329
 is changed so that there is a 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.040
 there is a new development now 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.709
 We also have something to think about again 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.159
 as in communication over the 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.569
 manager with markus and we are 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.229
 hope it's positive 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.229
 can conclude
