00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
first we get to this frog this is their

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.799 
first we get to this frog this is their
smaller<00:00:31.710> version<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> their<00:00:32.610> top<00:00:33.239> water<00:00:33.510> frog

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
smaller version of their top water frog

smaller version of their top water frog
collapsible<00:00:34.350> body<00:00:34.559> hooks<00:00:35.370> came<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> little

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
collapsible body hooks came out a little

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
collapsible body hooks came out a little
bit<00:00:36.239> dull<00:00:36.450> I'll<00:00:36.719> sharpen<00:00:37.020> those<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.710> haven't

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bit dull I'll sharpen those up I haven't

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.330 
bit dull I'll sharpen those up I haven't
used<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.489> yet<00:00:38.840> I'm<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.899> assuming<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.980> action

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
used it yet I'm just assuming the action

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.090 
used it yet I'm just assuming the action
is<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:41.940> similar<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
is going to be pretty similar to the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.380 
is going to be pretty similar to the
SPRO<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.670> copers<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:47.149> reason<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.210> bought

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
SPRO and the copers but reason I bought

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
SPRO and the copers but reason I bought
this<00:00:48.570> frog<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.350> small<00:00:50.000> I've

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
this frog is because it is small I've

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.830 
this frog is because it is small I've
seen<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> big<00:00:51.750> bass<00:00:52.640> hitting<00:00:53.640> small<00:00:54.090> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
seen a lot of big bass hitting small you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
seen a lot of big bass hitting small you
know<00:00:54.960> insects<00:00:55.739> whatnot<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.579> ponds

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
know insects whatnot and the my ponds

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
know insects whatnot and the my ponds
and<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.750> ones<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.109> fish<00:00:58.289> around<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.590> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and the ones that I fish around here in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
and the ones that I fish around here in
North<00:00:58.920> Florida<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.489> know<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> won't

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
North Florida I know I'm this won't

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
North Florida I know I'm this won't
chase<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> big<00:01:01.920> fish<00:01:02.129> away<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.300> hoping

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
chase the big fish away what I'm hoping

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
chase the big fish away what I'm hoping
for<00:01:03.629> though<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> size<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
for though is the size because it's a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.830 
for though is the size because it's a
little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.700> smaller<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.240> might<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> better

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
little bit smaller I might get a better

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.219 
little bit smaller I might get a better
hook<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.229> ratio<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.970> body<00:01:09.390> doesn't<00:01:09.600> collapse<00:01:09.990> as

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
hook up ratio a body doesn't collapse as

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
hook up ratio a body doesn't collapse as
easily<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.799> maybe<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.820> some<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> your

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
easily as maybe you know some of your

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.780 
easily as maybe you know some of your
higher<00:01:12.420> end<00:01:12.630> frogs<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.560> only<00:01:13.680> $3.50<00:01:14.640> by

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
higher end frogs this is only $3.50 by

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.969 
higher end frogs this is only $3.50 by
the<00:01:14.850> way<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> great<00:01:15.930> value<00:01:16.110> but

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the way I think it's a great value but

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.980 
the way I think it's a great value but
you<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.060> SPRO<00:01:18.330> collapse<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> little

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you know your SPRO collapse is a little

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.710 
you know your SPRO collapse is a little
bit<00:01:19.080> easier<00:01:19.380> bigger<00:01:19.680> hooks<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> whatnot<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
bit easier bigger hooks and whatnot I

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.210 
bit easier bigger hooks and whatnot I
haven't<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.560> success<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
haven't had good success with the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
haven't had good success with the
Coker's<00:01:23.580> though<00:01:23.729> I've<00:01:24.180> had<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> strikes

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
Coker's though I've had a lot of strikes

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
Coker's though I've had a lot of strikes
on<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> trimmed<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> tail

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
on it but you know I trimmed the tail

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
on it but you know I trimmed the tail
and<00:01:27.509> everything<00:01:27.600> hoping<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.350> would<00:01:28.470> help

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and everything hoping that would help

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
and everything hoping that would help
but<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> frog<00:01:30.299> fish<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
but you know I know how to frog fish I

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.260 
but you know I know how to frog fish I
let<00:01:30.930> them<00:01:31.020> hold<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.560> uh<00:01:31.939> not<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.119> much

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
let them hold it but uh not so much

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
let them hold it but uh not so much
success<00:01:33.420> yet<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.200> I've<00:01:34.259> casted<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
success yet on this one I've casted it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
success yet on this one I've casted it
probably<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.490> about<00:01:35.670> six<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.060> seven<00:01:36.299> trips<00:01:36.600> so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
probably in about six or seven trips so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
probably in about six or seven trips so
check<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.820> though<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
check this one out though I like this

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
will work good detail and this is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.370 
will work good detail and this is
amazing<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.560> body<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.880> one<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.360> all<00:03:13.110> hard

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
amazing the body on this one is all hard

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.410 
amazing the body on this one is all hard
those<00:03:13.800> soft<00:03:14.100> fins<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.550> back<00:03:14.610> or<00:03:14.970> tail<00:03:15.150> this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
those soft fins on the back or tail this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.080 
those soft fins on the back or tail this
one<00:03:15.600> hooks<00:03:16.200> sure<00:03:16.350> came<00:03:16.530> out<00:03:16.680> sharp<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.940> nice

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
one hooks sure came out sharp it's nice

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.430 
one hooks sure came out sharp it's nice
and<00:03:18.300> light<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.420> think<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.690> around<00:03:18.780> 4<00:03:19.110> ounces

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and light I think it's around 4 ounces

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.690 
and light I think it's around 4 ounces
so<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.740> won't<00:03:19.860> have<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.010> transition<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
so it won't have to transition to a
