 Hello my name is Ivan sheaves 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.980
 site revolverlab.com in this video tutorial I 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.650
 tell you how to get root access for 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.809
 samsung galaxy s4 but before starting 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.850
 let 's see why we need root for 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.190
 the average user is not a gecko 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.890
 this is cool this procedure which gives 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.300
 opens you with superuser rights 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.820
 full file system access 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.890
 smartphone with the ability to change and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.990
 adjustments to the settings of this system and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.910
 if an experienced user can very 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.220
 flexibly configure your smartphone on your own 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.480
 what root might be needed for 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.120
 simple consumer 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.160
 firstly if you have samsung galaxy s4 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 then you must have come across 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.520
 this smartphone can not be transferred 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.080
 applications to the memory card 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.000
 and sooner or later place on your 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.250
 the smartphone will end so that's it 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.950
 procedure for obtaining root rights on your 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.900
 s4 opens up such an opportunity now you 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.820
 you can safely download a huge amount 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.920
 applications and games and transfer them to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.660
 the memory card is thus not clogging 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.060
 remaining free space 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.680
 smartphone the second reason is the installation 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.470
 applications that are not root 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.060
 simply do not work bright example of such 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.980
 programs titanium backup 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.370
 thereby ensuring safety and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.350
 safety of all necessary information 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.480
 and this is not the only application 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.370
 if the root functions are important to you 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.800
 perhaps it is worth doing however immediately 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.750
 I warn you this procedure is not safe 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.670
