this<00:01:31.030> guy<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.270> know<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:32.200> know<00:01:32.320> why<00:01:32.500> he

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
this guy you know I don't know why he

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.959 
this guy you know I don't know why he
was<00:01:32.860> such<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.040> bad<00:01:33.219> player<00:01:33.460> but<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.729> just

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
was such a bad player but I just

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.249 
was such a bad player but I just
couldn't<00:01:34.149> score<00:01:34.509> passing<00:01:34.869> we<00:01:34.930> had<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.049> really

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
couldn't score passing we had a really

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.380 
couldn't score passing we had a really
good<00:01:35.409> goalkeeper<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.189> his<00:01:36.820> defenses

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
good goalkeeper and his defenses

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.069 
good goalkeeper and his defenses
defensive<00:01:38.640> tactics<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.790> guess<00:01:39.969> you<00:01:40.210> know<00:01:40.329> seem

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
defensive tactics I guess you know seem

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.260 
defensive tactics I guess you know seem
to<00:01:41.259> keep<00:01:41.439> them<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:42.040> really<00:01:42.880> couldn't<00:01:43.060> break

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
to keep them I really couldn't break

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.700 
to keep them I really couldn't break
this<00:01:43.390> guy<00:01:43.570> down<00:01:43.630> but<00:01:44.049> he<00:01:44.110> just<00:01:44.320> wasn't<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
this guy down but he just wasn't the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.889 
this guy down but he just wasn't the
best<00:01:44.860> attacking<00:01:45.280> hit<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.119> post<00:01:46.270> once<00:01:46.570> there

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
best attacking hit the post once there

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.029 
best attacking hit the post once there
you<00:01:47.140> know<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.409> could<00:01:47.560> have<00:01:47.680> quite<00:01:47.890> easily

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
you know that could have quite easily

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.529 
you know that could have quite easily
come<00:01:48.310> back<00:01:48.460> but<00:01:48.610> then<00:01:48.729> he<00:01:48.759> scores<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.119> nice<00:01:49.299> long

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
come back but then he scores a nice long

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.480 
come back but then he scores a nice long
shot<00:01:49.780> with<00:01:50.500> chip<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.130> was<00:01:51.369> actually

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
shot with chip so that was actually

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.969 
shot with chip so that was actually
quite<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.060> nice<00:01:52.299> goal<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.950> think

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
quite a nice goal and and I think

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.830 
quite a nice goal and and I think
there's<00:01:54.280> one<00:01:54.399> more<00:01:54.549> transition<00:01:55.210> for<00:01:55.570> him<00:01:55.659> to

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
there's one more transition for him to

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.480 
there's one more transition for him to
equalize<00:01:56.289> look<00:01:56.530> at<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.799> goes<00:01:57.009> for<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.280> tram

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
equalize look at that goes for the tram

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.029 
equalize look at that goes for the tram
goal<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.909> hits<00:01:58.719> it<00:01:59.289> doesn't<00:01:59.680> even<00:01:59.799> hit<00:01:59.979> the

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
goal and hits it doesn't even hit the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.399 
goal and hits it doesn't even hit the
side-netting<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:01.119> absolute<00:02:01.689> fail<00:02:01.899> shot<00:02:02.259> that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
side-netting one absolute fail shot that

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.420 
side-netting one absolute fail shot that
was<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:02.799> he<00:02:02.979> could<00:02:03.130> have<00:02:03.219> come<00:02:03.399> back

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
was you know he could have come back

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.819 
was you know he could have come back
quite<00:02:04.060> easily<00:02:04.270> after<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.990> but<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.590> did

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
know it takes quite a while to actually

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.450

you<00:05:44.949> know<00:05:45.070> how<00:05:45.610> he<00:05:45.669> was<00:05:45.940> such<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.120> good<00:05:46.210> player

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
you know how he was such a good player

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.899 
you know how he was such a good player
but<00:05:46.599> his<00:05:46.960> defense<00:05:47.139> you<00:05:47.919> know<00:05:48.039> I<00:05:48.250> think<00:05:48.729> he<00:05:48.789> was

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
but his defense you know I think he was

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.370 
but his defense you know I think he was
containing<00:05:49.360> or<00:05:49.479> something<00:05:49.780> because<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.169> guy

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
containing or something because this guy

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.810 
containing or something because this guy
was<00:05:50.409> just<00:05:50.770> I<00:05:50.949> couldn't<00:05:51.400> break<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:51.669> defense

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
was just I couldn't break the defense

was just I couldn't break the defense
down<00:05:52.090> at<00:05:52.360> all<00:05:52.479> maybe<00:05:52.990> because<00:05:53.229> there<00:05:53.380> was<00:05:53.469> five
