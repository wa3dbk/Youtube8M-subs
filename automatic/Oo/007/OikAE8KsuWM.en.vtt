okay<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:00.900> quick<00:00:01.079> video<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.740> show

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
okay so this is a quick video to show

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.590 
okay so this is a quick video to show
you<00:00:01.979> how<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.310> switch<00:00:02.610> between

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
you how to switch between

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.309 
you how to switch between
lvd<00:00:04.290> mode<00:00:04.680> active<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.850> LVD<00:00:06.330> mode<00:00:06.509> in<00:00:06.839> active

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
lvd mode active and LVD mode in active

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.539 
lvd mode active and LVD mode in active
on<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:09.860> evx<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.870> ESC<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> summit<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.340> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
on the evx to ESC on the summit this is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.519 
on the evx to ESC on the summit this is
the<00:00:14.730> inversion<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.750> low<00:00:16.260> voltage

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the inversion with the low voltage

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.779 
the inversion with the low voltage
detection<00:00:18.830> capability<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
detection capability this is actually a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.779 
detection capability this is actually a
new<00:00:21.150> esc<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> i<00:00:22.080> visit<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> my<00:00:22.680> old<00:00:22.789> summit

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
new esc that i visit to my old summit

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.429 
new esc that i visit to my old summit
the<00:00:23.939> previous<00:00:24.359> esc<00:00:24.750> didn't<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> low

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the previous esc didn't have a low

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.349 
the previous esc didn't have a low
voltage<00:00:25.650> detection<00:00:26.250> i<00:00:26.869> blew<00:00:27.869> up<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.109> couple<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
voltage detection i blew up a couple of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.630 
voltage detection i blew up a couple of
lipos<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.599> i<00:00:30.660> didn't<00:00:30.900> hear<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> alarm<00:00:31.640> on

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
lipos because i didn't hear the alarm on

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.170 
lipos because i didn't hear the alarm on
my<00:00:33.410> low<00:00:34.410> voltage<00:00:35.090> alarm<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.570> off<00:00:36.680> anyway<00:00:38.180> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
my low voltage alarm go off anyway so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
my low voltage alarm go off anyway so
this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.600> how<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.809> switch<00:00:40.340> from<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.640> mode<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this is how you switch from one mode to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.290 
this is how you switch from one mode to
the<00:00:42.480> other<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> give<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> quick<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.940> easy

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the other and to give a quick and easy

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
the other and to give a quick and easy
way<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> doing<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.430> currently<00:00:47.430> I'm

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
way of doing that so currently I'm

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.229 
way of doing that so currently I'm
running<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.930> mypos<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:50.700> let's<00:00:50.910> suppose<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
running to mypos and let's suppose that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.979 
running to mypos and let's suppose that
these<00:00:51.510> lipos

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
these lipos

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.680 
these lipos
have<00:00:52.260> run<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.480> bit

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
have run down so I want to get a bit

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
have run down so I want to get a bit
more<00:00:54.809> runtime<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> field<00:00:56.219> by

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
more runtime out in the field by

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.229 
more runtime out in the field by
switching<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.980> nickel<00:00:58.980> metal<00:00:59.070> hydride

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
switching to my nickel metal hydride

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.220 
switching to my nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.780> happen<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> have

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
batteries which I happen to have

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.179 
batteries which I happen to have
available<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.300> first<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:07.189> okay

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
available so first thing to do is okay

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.490 
available so first thing to do is okay
so<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.850> off<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.360> unplug<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.460> Y<00:01:11.460> pose<00:01:12.500> plug

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so it's off right unplug the Y pose plug

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.850 
so it's off right unplug the Y pose plug
in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.640> nickel<00:01:14.909> metal<00:01:15.000> hydrides<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
in the nickel metal hydrides right so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.990 
in the nickel metal hydrides right so
we've<00:01:16.979> got<00:01:17.009> both<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> those<00:01:17.490> batteries

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
we've got both of those batteries

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
we've got both of those batteries
connected<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.080> turn<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> C<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.710> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
connected now we turn on the C and it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
connected now we turn on the C and it
flashes<00:01:23.250> green<00:01:23.460> red<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.270> confused

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
flashes green red because it's confused

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.429 
flashes green red because it's confused
it's<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.580> LVD<00:01:26.610> low<00:01:27.090> voltage<00:01:27.450> detection<00:01:27.810> active

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it's in LVD low voltage detection active

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.179 
it's in LVD low voltage detection active
mode<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.890> nickel<00:01:31.890> metal<00:01:31.979> hydride

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189

batteries<00:01:33.000> which<00:01:34.100> -<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.280> play<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.869> how<00:01:36.869> do

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
batteries which - don't play so how do

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.149 
batteries which - don't play so how do
we<00:01:37.110> change<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
we change that

should find when we turn it off and back

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.040 
should find when we turn it off and back
on<00:02:25.290> again<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.830> goes<00:02:29.010> red<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:30.870> in

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
on again is it goes red so it's now in

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.790 
on again is it goes red so it's now in
lvd<00:02:31.830> inactive<00:02:32.820> mode<00:02:33.030> which<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.660> good<00:02:33.930> for

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
lvd inactive mode which is good for

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.920 
lvd inactive mode which is good for
running<00:02:35.100> with<00:02:35.660> nickel<00:02:36.660> metal<00:02:36.750> hydride

running with nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:02:38.780> okay<00:02:39.780> nice<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.170> easy<00:02:40.470> okay<00:02:40.739> so

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
batteries okay nice and easy okay so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400 
batteries okay nice and easy okay so
this<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> tell<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.510> how<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.959> switch

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
this is to tell you how to switch

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.790 
this is to tell you how to switch
between<00:02:44.810> nickel<00:02:45.810> metal<00:02:45.900> hydride<00:02:46.050> batteries

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
between nickel metal hydride batteries

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.620 
between nickel metal hydride batteries
and<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.580> light<00:02:47.760> both<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.330> need<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
and on to light both so you need to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.270 
and on to light both so you need to
switch<00:02:48.900> from<00:02:49.459> LVD<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:52.170> active<00:02:52.560> mode<00:02:52.739> which<00:02:53.130> is

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
switch from LVD in active mode which is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.660 
switch from LVD in active mode which is
the<00:02:53.400> red<00:02:53.520> light<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:55.560> lvd<00:02:56.010> active<00:02:56.489> mode

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the red light on to lvd active mode

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.449 
the red light on to lvd active mode
which<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.300> green<00:02:57.810> light<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.400> is

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
which is the green light on and this is

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.870 
which is the green light on and this is
how<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.760> do<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.269> first<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.930> all<00:03:00.989> turn<00:03:01.440> off

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
how you do it so first of all turn off

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.690 
how you do it so first of all turn off
the<00:03:02.880> SC<00:03:03.269> unplug<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.769> metal<00:03:05.220> hydride

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the SC unplug the metal hydride

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.150 
the SC unplug the metal hydride
batteries<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.720> plug<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.470> lye<00:03:10.650> purpose<00:03:11.299> so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
batteries and plug in the lye purpose so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.660 
batteries and plug in the lye purpose so
so<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.280> plugged<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.299> lipos<00:03:16.400> turn<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.519> on

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
so you plugged in the lipos turn it on

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.750 
so you plugged in the lipos turn it on
and<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.570> goes<00:03:18.660> into<00:03:18.870> red<00:03:19.049> mode<00:03:19.519> which<00:03:20.519> means

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
and it goes into red mode which means

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.270 
and it goes into red mode which means
it's<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.209> lvd<00:03:21.660> inactive<00:03:22.410> she's<00:03:22.920> no<00:03:23.040> good

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
it's in lvd inactive she's no good

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.120 
it's in lvd inactive she's no good
because<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:23.880> how<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.150> explode<00:03:24.950> your<00:03:25.950> life

because that's how you explode your life
poses<00:03:26.549> I've<00:03:26.700> learned<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.090> my<00:03:27.209> cost<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.340> what<00:03:29.340> we

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
poses I've learned to my cost so what we

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.289 
poses I've learned to my cost so what we
do<00:03:29.549> now<00:03:29.820> is<00:03:30.269> we<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.830> hold<00:03:31.830> down<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:33.120> button

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
do now is we just hold down the button

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.890 
do now is we just hold down the button
and<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.230> goes<00:03:34.350> off

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
short there it beeps and go green and

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.530 
short there it beeps and go green and
now<00:03:42.300> lvd<00:03:42.900> mode<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.379> active<00:03:44.150> we're<00:03:45.150> ready<00:03:45.360> to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
now lvd mode is active we're ready to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.770 
now lvd mode is active we're ready to
run<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:46.019> those<00:03:46.290> lipo's<00:03:47.209> hopefully<00:03:48.209> they<00:03:48.569> won't

run on those lipo's hopefully they won't

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.400 
run on those lipo's hopefully they won't
explode<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:50.580> how<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.790> switch<00:03:51.410> between

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
explode so that's how you switch between

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.130
