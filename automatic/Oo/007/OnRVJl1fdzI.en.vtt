 [Music] 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.719
 Plastic surgeries continue to generate 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.430
 controversial although you do not believe it in 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.289
 china- a man sued his wife 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.720
 because they had a daughter who thought 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.680
 a little graceful and did not look like 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.900
 him or his wife 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.939
 first I doubt his paternity but 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.500
 finally his wife confessed that he 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.420
 had undergone dozens of surgeries 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.789
 aesthetics to change your appearance 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.130
 how is it that two people arrive to be 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.140
 together it is assumed that in a bond of 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.539
 love but good when I find out that no 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 is this your face I demand you then not 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.920
 I would put on the table a little the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.989
 idea that I would question if it is that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.640
 we had really in that relationship every 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.260
 is more frequent than men and 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.239
 women from all over the world decide 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.609
 undergo risky procedures 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.799
 surgical to model your figures and 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.530
 refine their faces fix me what we are 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.659
 up and down tells me the nose implant 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.850
 of jaw I lifted my lips 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.409
 remove the implant from the jaw 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.089
 implants to increase my lips and two 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.670
 face lifting other 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.920
 complete lifting total 15 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.500
 surgical interventions looking 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.020
 correct those physical defects that the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.850
 they made you feel ugly without going far here 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.189
 we have the case of the journalist 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.020
 al and medina who started his career with 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.570
 a very different aspect to what you have today 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.159
 in day with the passing of the years magaly 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.659
 he went through the operating room in repeated 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.380
 occasions living a true 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.360
 transformation of 165 I can not do it 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.360
 excuse the hypocrisy does not go with 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.220
 we are going to a match 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.229
 another case of physical transformation is the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.270
 of the ex-star and former congresswoman susy 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.310
 day to see that the person is 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.470
 better than the action without chili 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.659
 Italian who underwent multiple 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.729
 surgical interventions for 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.130
 example increase taste and thicken 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:53.950
 her lips 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.950
 [Music] 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.180
 but there are extreme cases like the king's 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.979
 of pop michael jackson who suffered a 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.259
 true metamorphosis that left him 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.000
 however unrecognizable always 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.590
 It was hard to admit that his appearance changed 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.590
 it was due to plastic surgeries 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.289
 6 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.530
 hours 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.370
 is the pathology that leads a person 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.200
 to constantly modify your body 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.269
 because your mind exaggerates your defects 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.330
 physical is known as disorder 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.670
 body dysmorphic is the idea that the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.350
 person that despite becoming one and 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.530
 another change will never be fully 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.450
 satisfied internally is where 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.380
 find the vacuum that has to do with 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.870
 this idea of wanting to change 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.920
 constantly even from the physical 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.230
 how to see my nose finally change 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.080
 I also accept who I am inside 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.790
 as a person are already famous cases 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.799
 young girls who do dozens of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.230
 operations to look like the well-known 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.580
 barbie doll but last week a 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.740
 young american 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.810
 and two years surprised the world when 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.370
 appeared before cameras showing everything 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.710
 that he had done to his body to 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.210
 look like the doll that is not about 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.340
 physical casting of 32 years has made 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.350
 I would listen with 90 plastic surgeries that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.680
 include silicone implants in the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.240
 buttocks 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.430
 and the list continues in addition to reduction 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.700
 and refinement of nose so far 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.830
 has spent at least $ 100 to 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.470
 become what you display 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.840
 in the physical aspect who projects a 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.730
 personality also who is the husband 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.670
 from the husband of barbie not the boyfriend of 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.890
 barbie there is a theme and say perfect bis 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.470
 is then and there is an ideal life that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.360
 girls play in the barbie house 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.380
 all because everything is perfect 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.510
 the curvaceous blonde doll you have 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.790
 Husky then is the other person 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.680
 try to be like this but how empty is it going to 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.940
 feel when I really know what then 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.190
 is being like a plastic doll 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.620
 but if we talk about extremes we have in 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.750
 sorry case of genius with a pretty 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.460
 Korean woman who decided to undergo 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.860
 hundreds of operations on the face 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.200
 for two decades when his face more 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.820
 she was disfigured she felt more beautiful 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.280
 and already when no doctor was 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.380
 willing to operate it again the woman 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.960
 He decided to take a syringe and inject himself 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.580
 herself cooking oil because of 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.890
 big size of your face in comparison 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.870
 with the rest of his body is called 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:39.770
 cruelly the woman fan 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.770
 know only have region by nif 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.910
 many women risk their lives 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.770
 undergoing surgeries that do not need 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.900
 in an eagerness to achieve what they think 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.000
 it's perfection some end 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.100
 dead in the operating room and others in their 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.870
 own house as what happened to 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.210
 this former beauty queen of california 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.400
 that corn oil was injected for 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.290
 erase the lines of expression 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.320
 oil in the bloodstream was 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.210
 wreaking havoc on the entire body in 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.610
 the case of the Chinese who sued his wife 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.650
 for giving her an unattractive daughter the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.900
 man won the trial and his wife should 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.910
 pay him nothing less than 120 thousand dollars 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.070
 for hiding that he had 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.710
 undergoing dozens of cosmetic surgeries 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.290
 and it gives me to think about the attitude 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.480
 of man not only of the attitude of 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.340
 the woman in constant change the fact 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.050
 to cheat or lie because of all 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.570
 ways behind that there is an obsession 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.880
 there is a there is a there is a psychic problem 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.270
 emotional but there is also a theme in the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.640
 man not to not appreciate the value of the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.160
 person regardless of appearance 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.780
 physical cases like these lead us to a 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.289
 reflection on the need for 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.149
 undergo surgery this 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.699
 that are not necessary for the 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:52.770
 psychotherapist alejandro solomon all 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.930
 person who thinks to operate to change 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.939
 your appearance should first consult with a 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.979
 specialist to prevent the matter 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:01.710
 becomes over time a 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.509
 dangerous obsession and I recommend if 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.689
 are you thinking about making a change 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.849
 aesthetic first sees a therapist at a 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.469
 psychologist or a psychotherapist reviews with 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.449
 what does your motivation have to do with 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.639
 change and if you find out what it has to do 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.819
 with something that pushes you into a vacuum or 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.009
 some obsession or something that you do not accept 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.259
 even you is an opportunity to 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.330
 work on therapy and not put 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.330
 scalpel or laser beam ahead of time
