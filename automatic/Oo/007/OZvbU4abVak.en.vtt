00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.600
 Now uh this day gs clip exchange and fly next to it 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 I will install ten thousand yen 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.709
 I will remove this clip that is attached now 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.469
 Speech up 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.469
 I will put a lot 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.439
 next 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.439
 I will remove this clip of the new car 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.149
 is 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.029
 About the integrity of Ltd. 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.510
 Born grip 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.970
 The clip you are about to replace 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.510
 It becomes a clip of the second series 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.620
 Because it is ancient 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.700
 Contract too expensive 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910
 You can do it and maintain it 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 If put together like this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.200
 Because this part is out a little, brake kit shift 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.820
 I will go inside 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.140
 Even for the installment of 10,000 yen 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.760
 In a small cup 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 I'll do more work if I can go home 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.890
 I'm going with 4 mm of postponement 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.890
 At first this 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.119
 I'm going to be a legal adviser for the shift lever. 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 I will dream 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.440
 It moves like this 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 Put a clip 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 I will 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.360
 outside 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.150
 I will light up in front of you 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.450
 I will go through the clip 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.909
 When doing independent business by putting on net public sale, 15 people 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.300
 It is easy to relax and make costumes 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.060
 If the play is off, the shift lever will also Koizumi 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.820
 this is 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.710
 With both grips and that front, Ms. 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.380
 I will put out the setting 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 I will give everything in public 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.359
 8 Finally put on the end cap of the handle 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.140
 Because this plan can be set 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.379
 You can attach it just by flipping it. 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.089
 We will introduce you how to adjust the heat sink 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.329
 Why do you adjust the beauty treatment 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.379
 Powering up with this current condition or performance condition 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.740
 The handle is close when you are 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.950
 By making this Osaka difference 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.379
 Put that handle and 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.210
 To invite 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.940
 It seems that construction will have multiple positions like this 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.699
 In the sense that I will make 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.849
 I'm adjusting it from now on 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.989
 I will do exactly 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.139
 The way is 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.519
 First of all this 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.549
 It's a US actress and it's called a pressure plug here 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.839
 I will relax 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.849
 The reaction is broadened by reversing the point of view this time 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.249
 When that running 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.969
 That wind resistance It runs less and runs faster 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.969
 It will be easier to run even when 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.249
 Like this 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:21.809
 Tomomi Ando 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.129
 I say this 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.819
 I have a broken system 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 Because it is the state of the performance now 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.689
 The fresh-up lap is also completely lake 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.689
 I'm getting pregnant with the system 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.049
 I wanted to see- 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.059
 I will do my best with three soccer players 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.959
 Like this 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.959
 It will be the pressure I removed today 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.359
 I will return to the original position 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.849
 School too 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.849
 Loose in the temporary alliance 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:07.059
 Greatly overwhelmed, but can be added in a straight line 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.569
 It is good in borrowing degree here, but is done inside 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.549
 Losing 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.769
 I mentioned earlier 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.039
 Handle 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.709
 Grapes 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.370
 Don't let this can-mail character go wrong 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 Please be careful 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.529
 Hold the head of the second half 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.880
 When this unit is adopted and put on, it responds 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.880
 It agrees as order to go up to the average year 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.080
 setting change 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 Because such an intention would not be wonderful 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.710
 Please protect 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.710
 I actually got on this bike 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.610
 It is still a reaction even in the state where the anteeth was 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.589
 The person who thinks the other party 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:15.780
 Spacer 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.360
 Still going up and down 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.620
 Can be lowered and raised very much 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.170
 Enter this 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.660
 Celebrating custom milestones for batboy long rides 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.680
 I would like 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.339
 Make a speech 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.199
 I want to go on a long ride 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.499
 I think so
