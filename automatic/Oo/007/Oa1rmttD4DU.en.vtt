going<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.750> technology<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.680> something<00:00:02.190> that's

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
going to technology is something that's

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.490 
going to technology is something that's
inevitable<00:00:02.639> people<00:00:03.449> will<00:00:03.689> go<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> technology

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
inevitable people will go to technology

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.650 
inevitable people will go to technology
because<00:00:04.650> technology<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.490> spreading<00:00:05.970> far<00:00:06.629> and

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
because technology is spreading far and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.350 
because technology is spreading far and
wide<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.200> does<00:00:07.410> offer<00:00:07.620> some<00:00:07.770> advantages<00:00:08.550> but

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
wide it does offer some advantages but

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.330 
wide it does offer some advantages but
to<00:00:09.510> think<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.080> technology<00:00:10.710> alone<00:00:11.070> will

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to think that technology alone will

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.249 
to think that technology alone will
solve<00:00:11.639> problems<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.240> not<00:00:12.269> quite<00:00:12.690> right<00:00:12.960> I

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
solve problems is not quite right I

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.550 
solve problems is not quite right I
think<00:00:14.130> there<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:15.030> few<00:00:15.420> fundamental<00:00:16.139> issues

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
think there are a few fundamental issues

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
think there are a few fundamental issues
here<00:00:16.859> let's<00:00:17.789> assume<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
here let's assume that you can get a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.769 
here let's assume that you can get a
hundred<00:00:19.859> percent<00:00:20.100> connectivity<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.270> Internet

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
hundred percent connectivity to Internet

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.920 
hundred percent connectivity to Internet
and<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.260> let's<00:00:22.800> say<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> true

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
and all that let's say all that is true

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.620 
and all that let's say all that is true
the<00:00:24.930> biggest<00:00:25.260> problem<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.099> using<00:00:26.849> technology

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the biggest problem in using technology

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.359 
the biggest problem in using technology
is<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.429> use<00:00:29.490> technology<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.410> improve

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
is that if you use technology to improve

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.490 
is that if you use technology to improve
the<00:00:32.759> learning<00:00:32.910> outcomes<00:00:33.570> under<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> present

curriculum in the present education

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690 
curriculum in the present education
system<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:37.260> there's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> conflict<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

you have a particular advantage the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.190 
you have a particular advantage the
question<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.920> how<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.780> second<00:02:00.780> part<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
question is how you do it second part is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.749 
question is how you do it second part is
in<00:02:01.500> our<00:02:01.680> parts<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> world<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.430> least<00:02:02.460> I

in our parts of the world at least I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.800 
in our parts of the world at least I
can't<00:02:03.030> say<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.840> developed<00:02:04.799> world

is that in the modern world you should

is that in the modern world you should
be<00:02:33.310> looking<00:02:33.880> for<00:02:33.910> answers<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.540> should<00:02:34.660> become

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
be looking for answers you should become

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.810 
be looking for answers you should become
a<00:02:35.080> self<00:02:35.380> learner<00:02:35.740> because<00:02:36.280> there's<00:02:36.459> so<00:02:36.670> much

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
a self learner because there's so much

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.120 
a self learner because there's so much
out<00:02:37.000> there<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.360> be<00:02:37.450> learned<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.930> there's<00:02:38.800> no

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
out there to be learned and there's no

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.970 
out there to be learned and there's no
way<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.660> content<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.320> humanity<00:02:41.890> is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
way that the content that humanity is

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.550 
way that the content that humanity is
generated<00:02:42.490> over<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:42.970> many<00:02:43.120> hundred<00:02:43.540> years<00:02:43.570> can

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
generated over so many hundred years can

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.440 
generated over so many hundred years can
be<00:02:44.680> absorbed<00:02:45.040> over<00:02:45.400> five<00:02:45.670> ten<00:02:46.030> fifteen

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
be absorbed over five ten fifteen

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.440 
be absorbed over five ten fifteen
sixteen<00:02:46.989> years<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.670> important<00:02:49.150> thing<00:02:49.209> is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
sixteen years so the important thing is

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.600 
sixteen years so the important thing is
to<00:02:49.480> learn<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.020> skills<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.350> learning<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:51.370> learn

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
to learn the skills of learning to learn

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.090 
to learn the skills of learning to learn
cooperatively<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:53.050> old<00:02:53.260> system<00:02:53.680> says<00:02:53.890> you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
cooperatively the old system says you

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.470 
cooperatively the old system says you
are<00:02:54.400> gonna<00:02:54.640> learn<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.150> you're<00:02:55.300> going<00:02:55.450> to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
are gonna learn and you're going to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.540 
are gonna learn and you're going to
appear<00:02:55.720> for<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> exam<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.830> new<00:02:57.040> system<00:02:57.430> is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
appear for the exam the new system is

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.920 
appear for the exam the new system is
saying<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.850> can<00:02:58.000> work<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.330> groups<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.720> learn

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
saying you can work in groups and learn

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.410 
saying you can work in groups and learn
and<00:02:59.080> crack<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.440> problem<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.760> think<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.180> need

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
and crack the problem so I think we need

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120 
and crack the problem so I think we need
to<00:03:01.570> fundamentally<00:03:02.260> change<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.680> way<00:03:02.800> we<00:03:03.070> are

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
to fundamentally change the way we are

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.680 
to fundamentally change the way we are
learning<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.820> way<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.270> we<00:03:04.390> are<00:03:04.480> being

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
learning the way that we are being

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.060 
learning the way that we are being
assessed<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.320> certified<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:05.920> well<00:03:06.150> so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
assessed and certified as well so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.380 
assessed and certified as well so
policymakers<00:03:09.070> very<00:03:09.550> clearly<00:03:09.940> everybody<00:03:10.090> says

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
policymakers very clearly everybody says

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.530 
policymakers very clearly everybody says
put<00:03:10.570> computers<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.950> kids<00:03:12.160> hands<00:03:12.540> that's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
put computers in the kids hands that's

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.270 
put computers in the kids hands that's
only<00:03:13.720> part<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> problem<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.830> my<00:03:15.040> part

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
only part of the problem in in my part

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.370 
only part of the problem in in my part
of<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> world<00:03:15.670> even<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.570> content<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.230> not

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
of the world even the content is not

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.620 
of the world even the content is not
available<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.890> local<00:03:18.190> languages<00:03:18.640> if<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.420> go<00:03:19.570> to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
available in local languages if I go to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.930 
available in local languages if I go to
youtube<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:20.110> can<00:03:20.260> watch<00:03:20.410> many<00:03:20.650> things<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.910> I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
youtube I can watch many things but I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.370 
youtube I can watch many things but I
can't<00:03:22.239> translate<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.230> they're

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
can't translate that because they're

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.890 
can't translate that because they're
copyright<00:03:23.799> issues<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:25.060> after<00:03:25.420> all<00:03:25.630> those

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
copyright issues so after all those

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360 
copyright issues so after all those
things<00:03:26.170> are<00:03:26.350> done<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.560> think<00:03:26.920> we'll<00:03:27.040> be<00:03:27.160> ready

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
things are done I think we'll be ready

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.440 
things are done I think we'll be ready
for<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.959> proper<00:03:28.959> serious<00:03:29.890> use<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.580> technology

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
for a proper serious use of technology

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.170 
for a proper serious use of technology
right<00:03:31.690> now<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.959> technology<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:32.680> only<00:03:32.799> a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
right now the technology is only a

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.790 
right now the technology is only a
helper<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.769> current<00:03:35.769> inefficient<00:03:36.430> system
