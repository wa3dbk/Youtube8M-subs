00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and the fit and it's not just me it's a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.420 
and the fit and it's not just me it's a
team<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.120> people<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.859> are<00:00:16.859> creating<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
team of people that are creating the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.050 
team of people that are creating the
great<00:00:17.609> product<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:22.580> mean<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.880> high

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
great product I mean I have high

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.849 
great product I mean I have high
expectations<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.019> think<00:00:25.230> our<00:00:25.410> team<00:00:25.590> has

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
expectations and I think our team has

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
expectations and I think our team has
high<00:00:26.010> expectations<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.269> puts<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> lot<00:00:27.810> of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
high expectations so that puts a lot of

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.210 
high expectations so that puts a lot of
pressure<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.199> everybody<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:29.039> that's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
pressure on everybody but I think that's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
pressure on everybody but I think that's
the<00:00:29.369> challenge<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.359> we're<00:00:30.539> doing<00:00:30.840> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the challenge of what we're doing in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350 
the challenge of what we're doing in
this<00:00:31.050> creative<00:00:31.500> process<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this creative process and I think the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
this creative process and I think the
industry<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.989> general<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.760> high
