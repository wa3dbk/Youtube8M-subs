00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
the best in all of those areas and that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.910 
the best in all of those areas and that
is<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:32.209> theme<00:01:32.509> that's<00:01:32.750> over<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.200> over<00:01:33.380> again<00:01:33.470> no

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
is a theme that's over and over again no

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.529 
is a theme that's over and over again no
matter<00:01:34.069> what<00:01:34.280> age<00:01:34.459> group<00:01:34.759> there<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.450> I

matter what age group there is and I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.300 
matter what age group there is and I
think<00:01:35.810> those<00:01:36.050> are<00:01:36.259> important<00:01:36.679> aspects<00:01:37.160> to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
think those are important aspects to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.190 
think those are important aspects to
emphasize<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.270> each<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.599> the<00:01:38.690> visits<00:01:39.020> for

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
emphasize on each of the visits for
