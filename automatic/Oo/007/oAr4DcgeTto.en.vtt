the<00:02:03.149> timing<00:02:03.509> isn't<00:02:03.630> quite<00:02:03.899> clear<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.140> would

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the timing isn't quite clear that would

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.080 
the timing isn't quite clear that would
have<00:02:04.560> been<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> last<00:02:05.280> quarter<00:02:05.640> but
