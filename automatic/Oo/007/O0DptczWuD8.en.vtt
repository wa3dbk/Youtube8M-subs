00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.929
 video of me in this video I show 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.780
 you like the pragmatik tubes and the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.030
 filter works that is at all 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.359
 not hard you see these are youtubes 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.160
 that's the filter like the stuff 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 that's what you're looking at 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.519
 how always in time how much we like it 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.140
 here the initial situation is a capacitor 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.189
 which is filled with dirt that I want 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.670
 now just here 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.350
 This box is a war so I take me 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.820
 put the filter on it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 the topic is simply set 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.350
 if I now still with the filter 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.579
 he would provide a redstone signal 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.280
 everything in this box throughout 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.730
 is there purely hunt and although as vollers 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 carpet shows the tomb that was then 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.540
 of course wrong now you see this here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.479
 there is always a whole day he is there 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.320
 we have to get out 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.780
 you have an interface here you can 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.970
 to the new objects also fooled 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 full text is the example i put 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.700
 now 5 tracks in and now we come 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.520
 only sizes of the 53 kraus by 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.460
 Of course you can filter very well 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 build because she can do that too 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 Dream very well and goes very well 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.650
 fix yes that's already the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.869
 basics on the thematic tubes and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.180
 drive to the filter for the extension 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.360
 had had many thanks for 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.360
 look at
