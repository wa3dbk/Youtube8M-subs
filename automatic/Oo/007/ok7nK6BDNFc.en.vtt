00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello hello i start ashore hard drive 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.400
 to give him a point somewhere en go today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.639
 I explain to you how you are a neti 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 pot 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.969
 so so do your nose can rinse 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 well when i first heard that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 then i really thought no going fake there 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
 we go 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.789
 she started when I was once in an army 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.010
 medical center was ok late in 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.349
 I've tried it and since then do it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.230
 I therefore regularly and certainly in the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.059
 winter weather is coming, yes it is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.300
 a good idea to do this for more 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.590
 that is just with water that water 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 a little bit of salt in what should be 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 course say yes little look 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 on your body 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.010
 body fluids what we do is we 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.579
 then can and a little salt I have 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.199
 you use exactly a large teaspoon 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:07.470
 I also do that here, then 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.640
 small half liter of warm water 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.640
 oh beautiful blue water 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.560
 something like that i take the neti pot and in there 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 and then I go through my nose 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 shoot all the most important stains 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.030
 problem is that you just don't get through 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 stop but just not because of you 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.310
 nose and especially 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.050
 because the salt water so well 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.250
 yes amro except 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.680
 other side of your fingers so I will 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.290
 so for now your head must be properly cleaned 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.840
 because that goes through one nostril 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.840
 in and by other mary cute out 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 so your posture so hang your arm 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 slightly upward so the stitch point in which 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.200
 your nose and so I'm going to stop 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.310
 talking man talking and casting that for free 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.020
 not at the same time but then you can 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.820
 see that I had my whole nose 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.000
 nobody from my other house was good 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.000
 plan 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 so you do that with a whole bowl 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.770
 what does take a little too long then 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.770
 a tissue of course 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:49.270
 close and or eat delicious meat 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.880
 So does first gate by one 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.760
 nostril and then jar through it 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.300
 different nostril and if you parker there 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.220
 no sure if yes account is in you 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.590
 more likely to catch a cold 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.620
 then it is just very tasty 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.230
 and I would say good luck with it 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.570
 if you have any questions put it at the bottom on the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.110
 I will answer Sander's website 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.110
 thanks
