body we withdraw hand immediately we

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980 
body we withdraw hand immediately we
detect<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> change<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.090> heart<00:01:06.390> body<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
detect the change of the heart body and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
detect the change of the heart body and
respond<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> by<00:01:08.250> moving<00:01:08.670> hand<00:01:08.909> away<00:01:09.360> from

controlled by a system in the body for
example<00:01:19.700> when<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.850> are<00:01:20.969> in<00:01:21.119> class<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.109> want

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
example when we are in class if we want

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
example when we are in class if we want
to<00:01:22.469> speak<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> friend<00:01:23.390> generally<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.539> speak

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
to speak to a friend generally we speak

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.590 
to speak to a friend generally we speak
in<00:01:24.960> lower<00:01:25.229> voice<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.979> whispers<00:01:26.729> rather<00:01:27.359> than

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
in lower voice or whispers rather than

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.349 
in lower voice or whispers rather than
shouting<00:01:28.969> why<00:01:31.009> because<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.060> recognize

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
shouting why because we can recognize

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.219 
shouting why because we can recognize
the<00:01:33.780> environment<00:01:34.469> around<00:01:34.619> us<00:01:35.039> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> class

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
the environment around us in the class

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
the environment around us in the class
here<00:01:37.229> movement<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.310> whether<00:01:38.609> to<00:01:38.729> whisper<00:01:39.299> or

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
here movement is whether to whisper or

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.359 
here movement is whether to whisper or
shout<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.499> the<00:01:40.979> environment<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.880> class

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
shout and the environment is class

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.919 
shout and the environment is class
therefore<00:01:44.369> control<00:01:45.210> movement<00:01:45.659> must<00:01:45.810> be

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
therefore control movement must be

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.289 
therefore control movement must be
connected<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.859> recognition<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.579> various

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
connected to recognition of various

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.690 
connected to recognition of various
events<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.929> environment<00:01:49.740> followed<00:01:50.490> by

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
events in environment followed by

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.399 
events in environment followed by
correct<00:01:51.299> movement<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.020> response<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:53.359> example
