00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.340
 well here we have what they are 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.720
 control with motor and its speeds on 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.689
 which works with three visions of 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.850
 relays and 3 and n the transmitters the 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.430
 which interpret even the peak a 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.830
 moment of crisis taking the pulse 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.270
 transistors increase the power 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.390
 making the elevators activate the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.750
 elevators write a different load 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:39.220
 of a battery action motorcycles and these 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.220
 expire with different speed respect 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:00.810
 Well, here we have what it is 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:03.290
 is the electric of two guys with boots 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.420
 one of the two possible faults is that 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 one of the bands 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.909
 and stop working like that from natural 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.909
 they would go through the passage of time 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 the electric does not have a backup 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 of energy then if the light is going to 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.200
 wash it off completely 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.320
 as you can see the band works 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.970
 only one way and it only works 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.010
 upwards 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.010
 it is powered with 8 and 12 volts
