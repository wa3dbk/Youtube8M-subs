hi this is my little ultimate badass
solid-state<00:00:06.330> charge<00:00:06.839> on<00:00:07.080> circular<00:00:07.820> and<00:00:08.820> I

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
solid-state charge on circular and I

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.540 
solid-state charge on circular and I
just<00:00:10.170> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> show<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.769> because<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.400> my

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
just want to show this because in my

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.060 
just want to show this because in my
opinion<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.450> very<00:00:13.200> cheap<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.769> easy

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
opinion this is a very cheap and easy

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.620 
opinion this is a very cheap and easy
version<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.730> what<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> lot<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> people<00:00:15.269> are

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
version of what a lot of people are

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.750 
version of what a lot of people are
spending<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.320> thousand<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.920> couple<00:00:17.340> thousand

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
spending a thousand a couple thousand

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
spending a thousand a couple thousand
dollars<00:00:17.789> long<00:00:18.350> which<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> little

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
dollars long which is a little

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.990 
dollars long which is a little
ridiculous<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.430> me<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:25.640> you<00:00:26.640> know<00:00:26.820> what<00:00:26.939> they

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
ridiculous to me but you know what they

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.139 
ridiculous to me but you know what they
want<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.769> but<00:00:28.769> uh<00:00:29.390> all<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.320> very

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
want to do but uh all this is is very

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
want to do but uh all this is is very
what<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> looks<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> damn<00:00:33.989> rashness

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
what it looks like as a damn rashness

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
what it looks like as a damn rashness
was<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.309> they<00:00:35.430> were<00:00:35.550> called<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:37.050> may

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
was what they were called it but it may

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.600 
was what they were called it but it may
look<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.469> crap<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.070> works<00:00:38.160> pretty<00:00:38.489> good

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
look like crap but it works pretty good

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780 
look like crap but it works pretty good
it's<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.059> simple<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.899> gotta<00:00:40.260> drive<00:00:40.559> coil<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
it's very simple I gotta drive coil this

it's very simple I gotta drive coil this
section<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.390> very<00:00:42.750> similar<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> Abedini

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
section here is very similar to Abedini

section here is very similar to Abedini
circuit<00:00:44.360> except<00:00:45.360> I've<00:00:45.570> got<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> third<00:00:46.170> winding

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
circuit except I've got a third winding

circuit except I've got a third winding
on<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.500> I'm<00:00:49.500> basically<00:00:49.920> using

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
on this right here I'm basically using

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.310 
on this right here I'm basically using
two<00:00:50.550> wires<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> shelf<00:00:51.600> isolation

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
two wires just to get a shelf isolation

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.400 
two wires just to get a shelf isolation
and<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.890> tapping<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> high<00:00:53.640> voltage<00:00:54.410> across

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and I'm tapping the high voltage across

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.889 
and I'm tapping the high voltage across
the<00:00:55.680> trigger<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.219> I've<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> third<00:00:57.420> winding

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the trigger and I've got a third winding

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
the trigger and I've got a third winding
here<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.949> low<00:00:59.190> inductance<00:00:59.489> pick<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
here that's got low inductance pick a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
here that's got low inductance pick a
wire<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.780> being<00:01:00.989> rectified<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.739> charging<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
wire it's being rectified is charging a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.240 
wire it's being rectified is charging a
capacitor<00:01:02.930> that's<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.350> excess<00:01:05.010> energy

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
capacitor that's just my excess energy

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.640 
capacitor that's just my excess energy
that<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.240> using<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.380> switch

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that right now I'm using it to switch

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
that right now I'm using it to switch
this<00:01:07.830> relay<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.670> posting<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.210> circular

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this relay for my posting in circular

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
this relay for my posting in circular
and<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.369> basically<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and this is basically just a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
and this is basically just a
three-in-one<00:01:12.450> charger<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
three-in-one charger because what it is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.810 
three-in-one charger because what it is
is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.790> regular<00:01:15.659> charger<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:17.460> i<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:17.790> for

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
is a regular charger that i use for

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.690 
is a regular charger that i use for
charging<00:01:18.600> anything<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.290> no<00:01:19.950> button<00:01:20.340> cell<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
charging anything from no button cell to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910 
charging anything from no button cell to
a<00:01:20.729> car<00:01:21.030> battery<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.930> i<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.229> switch<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.560> with

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a car battery and i can switch it with

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120 
a car battery and i can switch it with
this<00:01:23.130> knob<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> high<00:01:23.939> voltage<00:01:24.210> mode<00:01:25.170> which

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
this knob to a high voltage mode which

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
this knob to a high voltage mode which
basically<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.610> sends<00:01:27.030> my<00:01:27.150> poles<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.659> a

the<00:02:03.509> poses<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.950> uh<00:02:05.960> right<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the poses but uh right now I'm going to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.999 
the poses but uh right now I'm going to
cut<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:08.509> right<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> our<00:02:10.200> regular

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
cut it on right now it's in our regular

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.390 
cut it on right now it's in our regular

excuse<00:02:17.400> me<00:02:17.489> after<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.819> neon<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:20.160> guess

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
excuse me after the neon and I guess

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.160 
excuse me after the neon and I guess
first<00:02:20.879> I'm<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.390> show<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.720> rate<00:02:21.930> at

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
first I'm just going to show the rate at

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.199 
first I'm just going to show the rate at
which<00:02:22.200> it'll<00:02:22.620> charge<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.819> I'm<00:02:23.879> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.060> take

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
which it'll charge so I'm going to take

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.940 
which it'll charge so I'm going to take
this<00:02:24.330> 12-volt<00:02:24.870> down<00:02:25.049> here<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> broke<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.920> up

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
this 12-volt down here and broke that up

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.100 
this 12-volt down here and broke that up
so<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.239> going<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> let<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.720> voltage

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
so I'm just going to let the voltage

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
so I'm just going to let the voltage
rise<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.799> bit<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.549> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
rise a little bit so you can see the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.150 
rise a little bit so you can see the
break

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
going to be less current so it won't

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.330

work on this very very well for charging

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.730 
work on this very very well for charging
then<00:02:54.210> it's<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> draw<00:02:54.870> about<00:02:55.110> 200<00:02:55.650> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.340 

so<00:03:14.770> I'm<00:03:15.190> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.340> take<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.550> off

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.180 

let's<00:03:20.350> switch<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.650> over<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.040> high<00:03:21.160> voltage

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
let's switch it over to the high voltage

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.810 
let's switch it over to the high voltage
now<00:03:22.440> now<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.500> can<00:03:23.710> see<00:03:23.920> kicking<00:03:24.670> out<00:03:24.790> on

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
now now you can see kicking out on

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.150 
now now you can see kicking out on
lateness<00:03:25.210> for<00:03:25.480> lessons<00:03:25.930> about<00:03:26.020> 500<00:03:26.740> volts<00:03:26.920> and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160

what<00:03:27.280> i<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.490> left<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.940> about<00:03:28.260> 127<00:03:29.260> volts<00:03:29.590> so

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
what i have left is about 127 volts so

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.120 
what i have left is about 127 volts so
that's<00:03:30.580> what<00:03:30.760> i<00:03:30.790> would<00:03:31.000> use<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.650> help<00:03:32.830> restore

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
that's what i would use to help restore

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
then cut it off but there you have it
