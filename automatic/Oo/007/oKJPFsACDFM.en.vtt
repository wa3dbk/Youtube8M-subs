00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.030
 hello to all the people of the face game 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.279
 I am embroidering 12 and today I am here 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.439
 on this fantastic channel to offer you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.330
 a somewhat particular review but 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.520
 first let me thank all the staff 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 of physical tea but then taylor tv 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.720
 rinnegan and whoever else is behind it 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.210
 this fantastic channel I talk about 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 little special reviews because it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 you will see that your eyes know that it is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.730
 divided into eight points graphic plot 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 soundtrack long lived so many needs 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 artificial levels playability designs 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 the value for money at which the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.830
 world sign 0 to 12 and a half but know 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.309
 that the votes will not be very adri is now 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:53.610
 below with the first point then the plot is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.190
 or the game doesn't have a plot, at least me 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.019
 I managed to locate one of them 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.519
 wikipedia even dinner a few hints 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.979
 so I can't bring you back what 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.019
 he says is apparently only 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.700
 a bunch of meaningless scene 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.119
 without a logical connection between one and the other 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.040
 the other one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.869
 we are completely at the mercy of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.310
 events rambling events that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 they'll ask why I'm doing 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.570
 this every two minutes 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.189
 I got it you are me afghanistan colo 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 later in a jungle one after that again 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.369
 who knows where 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.679
 really arouses violent instincts 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.939
 there is not even much to say why not 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.159
 there is really nothing to talk about 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.929
 there is no plot and rarely assigns 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.109
 much of the genre also in the plot here 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:34.009
 therefore we cannot avoid the plot 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.009
 0 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.590
 first of all we place the graphics 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.819
 temporally indispensable software 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.899
 for a good classification of the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.789
 graphics 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.049
 from the images we could hypothesize and tar 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.880
 2002 2003 maybe maximum 2004 instead 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.100
 gentlemen gentlemen we are facing a 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.469
 game released at the end of 2007 in 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.179
 some countries in 2008 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.079
 let's just make a comparison to understand each other 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.960
 crisis came out better in 2007 than not 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.689
 needless to say how much better it is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 registry but in spite of everything if the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.840
 we have to compare with everything else 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.240
 which we will find in the game 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.040
 the graphics are almost well done almost ok 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.420
 well done maybe not but there is from ad 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.440
 example the possibility of escorting the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.500
 enemies that is not little 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.500
 so we are graphic magnanimous 3 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.950
 here too we are in the non category 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.239
 received 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.310
 the software soundtrack is from 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.020
 all absent then for the rest 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 explosions and gunshots are 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.480
 well done but for those there 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.360
 even one who never has 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.560
 designed a video game in his life 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 the only chance he would have for 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.790
 keep enough would be if it were a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.319
 low budget game that cost little 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.450
 maybe they gave it to you 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.900
 but it is not so therefore the vote must be 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:54.600
 adjust audio2 from a game that has one 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.060
 absent plot an embarrassing graphic a 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.280
 non-existent audio and one of which 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.260
 we will talk soon but it is not to be joked 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.180
 also what you expect from the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.970
 longevity that is known almost nothing true 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.780
 and instead and instead you perfectly 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.670
 reason 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.080
 like most games that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.959
 longevity falls under this heading 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.120
 of soft 3 something embarrassing the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.160
 time completely if it turns on 3 4 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.209
 hours at most 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.209
 the only thing that can stretch it a 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.290
 little foolish design of the levels of 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.450
 which we will discuss later 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.190
 but it is also fortunate that it lasts so 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.570
 little because otherwise I think the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.090
 suicide rate of those who have 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:36.930
 tried it would be much higher longevity 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.780
 0 ladies and gentlemen I present to you 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.940
 sawyer or fortun 3 the masterpiece of 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.739
 videogame shit par excellence a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.569
 concentrate of errors and behavior 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.049
 stupid that you rarely see in 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.840
 a game 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.850
 the idiocy festival you will see enemies 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.760
 it will come out of a wall and be riddled 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.840
 your shots without looking for shelter 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.579
 opponents who will throw themselves against the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.829
 your grenades eager to blow themselves up 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.750
 in the air soldiers who will be put on 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.940
 row to be massacred by making of 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.680
 use as few punishments as possible 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.200
 in short, a show of pure rubbish 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.090
 artificial so much magnificence deserves a 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.739
 adequate way so that you remember how 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.359
 I will remember this crap for a long time 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.359
 time at 0 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.810
 here too there is the try the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.789
 suicide 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.680
 you really don't save anything in this 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.120
 game levels are done in one 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.770
 horrible way often not understood 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.570
 not even what should be done 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.099
 enemies shoot at the all-around wave 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.550
 places where we had already square up 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.260
 clean 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.940
 almost every level and strata of the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 embarrassing obstacles that prevent us 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
 the passage even for several minutes 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.920
 the maximum before finding the exit 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.720
 will be what we will find ourselves in front of one 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.010
 unpresentable erased standing 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 falling apart 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.820
 then you throw grenades and we wo n't be able to 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.800
 nothing to break down or jump over 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.390
 despite staring at him no one around anymore 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.070
 we will be forced to wander around for minutes 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.570
 endless for the desert field up 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.160
 to find damn passage e 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.990
 those brilliant minds and programmers 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.540
 they left hidden in the place more 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.130
 unlikely they made me mad more 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.660
 of everything else is also stretched 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.540
 even more the game design of the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.070
 levels 0 the playability is usually 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.660
 something simple that is difficult 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.460
 make mistakes but they managed to make a 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.560
 mess here too deserve 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.970
 really a separate medal than in 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.530
 I couldn't run my computer 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.000
 I don't know if some tender my version of 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.740
 the whole game but the pressing of the button 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.110
 the whole screen was made for the shot 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.430
 white as well as perhaps a great deal 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.830
 bad at least I did not see the disgust that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.510
 there was some behind it though 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.250
 details not bad this time there 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.000
 we will find some people shooting 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.440
 does not die 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.690
 no matter what weapons from what 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.820
 neighbors simply the cp 1 will detect i 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.130
 our shots to start will detect the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.810
 his and we will die other times there 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.350
 we will find ourselves in front of low mortals 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.610
 we hit them but they will not die 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.800
 could go on for now to shoot them 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.479
 the numbers they give will never need tricks 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.080
 to pass to the next level as 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.040
 these boxwoods are truly immortal 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.720
 let's add also very nice 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.070
 he answers enemies from places we already had 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.350
 made a clean sweep that we see in 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.580
 senate and the numerous possibility of 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.200
 choice of weapons at the beginning of the level 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.729
 which will be completely useless as it is not 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.169
 you will find the shots to recharge it in 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.490
 ride and you're done 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.490
 playability 1 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.660
 I believe you already imagine the vote too 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.889
 if you don't know yet how much it costs 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.440
 would cost even two euros would be 0 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.539
 anyway but as if this were not enough 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.780
 game currently costs after five years 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.100
 30 euros and his exit cost his 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.620
 from 50 60 euros 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.910
 I don't believe that you accept a thing 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.949
 like that for a game of this 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.470
 level and I would like to give him much less but 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.720
 I can not maybe a good 20 min 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.830
 nothing to enforce the table 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.830
 value for money zero 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.449
 we have thus come to the conclusion e 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.460
 I think he said I was never aware of what 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.960
 stretch horrible video games yes but that 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.810
 they were designed as video games 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.220
 beautiful and have failed miserably but 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.080
 before arriving at the final vote I wanted 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.210
 remind you that on my channel you find 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.800
 other recent similar video games though 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.780
 you want to drop by and maybe 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.240
 register seat absolutely welcome 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.919
 but we come to the vote and let me say that ai 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.500
 lowest I've ever given for you is 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.050
 in fact, only the best is reserved 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.380
 you are glad indeed ladies and gentlemen 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.060
 the final score of 6 out of 100 goes 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.180
 therefore to classify the first place 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.760
 taive most forgettable games ever made 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.560
 and lived here and I hope to see you again 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.789
 to the next review definitely on 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.830
 my channel maybe who knows 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.539
 here again in the channel reserved for 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.539
 great youtubers soon
