however what I found out is something
that<00:01:11.930> actually<00:01:12.080> wasn't<00:01:12.590> listed<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.460> patch

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
that actually wasn't listed in the patch

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.750 
that actually wasn't listed in the patch
notes<00:01:13.729> I'm<00:01:14.270> not<00:01:14.750> sure<00:01:15.040> why<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.100> wasn't<00:01:16.490> listed

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
notes I'm not sure why it wasn't listed

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
in the patch notes and therefore I'm not

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.680 
in the patch notes and therefore I'm not
even<00:01:19.010> sure<00:01:19.250> if<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.580> was<00:01:19.670> implemented<00:01:20.150> in<00:01:20.479> this

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
even sure if it was implemented in this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.890 
even sure if it was implemented in this
patch<00:01:20.930> or<00:01:21.409> one<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.630> previous<00:01:23.630> patches

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
patch or one of the previous patches

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.960
