 let's unpack it together 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.060
 for the rest 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:23.800
 here is the ladder I was talking about 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:26.080
 let's try to raise it like that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.600
 let's see how long it is 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 suddenly the fire will be on the top floor 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:49.560
 push ukhty it is even above my head 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:49.560
 remove it for now and this is what 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.299

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.420
 Flashing Light 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.930

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.659
 the driver's door opens like this 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.420
 any fire truck needs water 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.349

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.349

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:13.020

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:18.590

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.590

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:54.490
