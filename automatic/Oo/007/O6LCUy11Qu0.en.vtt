the level editor see and switch between
the<00:01:24.090> different<00:01:24.140> objects<00:01:25.140> change<00:01:25.770> various

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the different objects change various

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
the different objects change various
values<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.210> position<00:01:28.200> size<00:01:28.710> color<00:01:29.520> etc<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
values like position size color etc and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230 
values like position size color etc and
then<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> attachment<00:01:32.040> button<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.030> can

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
then that attachment button you can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
then that attachment button you can
break<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.140> level<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> show<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
break the level as I'm going to show you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.100 
break the level as I'm going to show you
now<00:01:35.670> it'll<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.479> bigger<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:38.060> there's<00:01:40.400> a

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
now it'll make this bigger so there's a

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
now it'll make this bigger so there's a
button<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:45.090> levels<00:01:45.570> created<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.880> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
button and the levels created see that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.350 
button and the levels created see that
easy<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.780> also<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.290> save<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.130> load

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
easy and also you can save and load

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.280 
easy and also you can save and load
levels<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.630> I'll<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.020> leave<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:53.009> this
