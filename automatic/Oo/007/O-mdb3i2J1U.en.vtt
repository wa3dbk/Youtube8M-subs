00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
 tomorrow the cup match against whc is scheduled and just before Christmas 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 when the selection turned from their best side volunteers fred and marieke into 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.479
 put the spotlight 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.710
 after 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.469
 7 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.960
 6 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.269
 the kick-off 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.249
 lots of fun 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.310
 graphically 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.499
 as the holiday fourth 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.699
 last year 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.359
 networks 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.989
 read more not this time there was also a little bit their camp was not 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.060
 more in 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.820
 the sale again 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
 I have a little further 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.590
 and this is really just one of many objects from a distant past 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.700
 we were actually 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.860
 the suspect is not yes 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.910
 it is expected that were not planned 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.100
 ten men on average 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.059
 forty percent 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.010
 yes according to renÃ© 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.080
 while the Netherlands is still limited 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.140
 in a thick layer of snow, gig has good hope that tomorrow's cup match 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.430
 just continue 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 I think we will continue to be 6 busy 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 so pleased to release they have one 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.389
 a kind of self-confident heartless 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.250
 There are 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.040
 I think it goes on 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 you 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.229
 with an offensive not trained that shows 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.280
 that gig takes this competition and it seriously 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 I think we are very serious about it 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 the best round to get ahead and then it is always 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 on the eye it is better to play at another club where they play against PSV 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.980
 plays 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.300
 so we take this situation more seriously of the game, so it's only about 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.180
 to 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.790
 that the players also realize this in the processes 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.040
 and if teachers do not realize that they should not play out so you have them 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 also viewed park equipment network 2 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.549
 and the unions but that is because of other cameras 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.379
 we were used to in particular 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.220
 took over this summer but we have everything around him 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:26.449
 wheel that is offside 8 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.699
 Bah
