00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.550
 business I was in college for 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.079
 learn Mandarin and English so 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.739

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.030
 who drew me to do my job 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.510

 work with the seasons and sublimate 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 products the curriculum is done in three 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.680
 years of which first year of preparation 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.329
 we learn all the basics

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.160
 chance to do my internships in 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.000
 prestigious houses especially in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.540
 gourmet and 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.010
 and in starry houses I think 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.870
 that the name of this school can help me 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.670
 in my career because the professionals 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.500
 know that we are trained 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.360
 undertake and we have a 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 really very complete training very 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.110
 opened 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 the vision we give of this profession in 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.159
 this school 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.929
 simply a very broad vision 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.880
 that is, we are not only 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.710
 technicians we practice not only 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.480
 in kitchens where opens to others 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.270
 branches including management 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.810
 marketing the right creativity the side 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.580
 artistic in order to better undertake to 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.890
 the end of these three years of Bachelor 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.320
 we must therefore realize a memoir that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.260
 is to take over a business 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.330
 or chalk must have a concept 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.620
 also work on management 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.630
 on the financial parts in me 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.210
 still asks for a job enough 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.490
 therefore we are asked to search 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.380
 to be curious to go to inquire about 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.430
 look at a lot of cookbooks 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.110
 today I really feel 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.960
 to be ready to practice my profession at 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.240
 daily 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.940

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.980

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.830

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.740
 interesting is that we have 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.280
 regularly demonstrations of 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.680
 heads 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.880
