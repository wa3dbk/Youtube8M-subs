00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello guys today I 'm going to show you a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.350
 Realistic style drawing using 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.300
 colored pencils premier color 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 drawing is not complete because I delayed 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.099
 a lot to do it about 21 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.619
 hours but has the most scenes 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 important that I consider so that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.859
 you can also apply this type 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.220
 of destructive technique games of way 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.869
 personal as you see this is a drawing of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 a flower called copihue is a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.189
 actor in technique here of chile and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 obviously that 's the reason why 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.380
 I drew as you see I start by applying a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.850
 layer of pink color and then I start 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.399
 to apply a layer of red color 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.280
 combined also with shadows and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.590
 obviously the color black 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 usually the layers of this drawing 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 there are three to the maximum four because of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.969
 this is because obviously if the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 we started to apply many layers in the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.739
 pencil is going to reach a point in the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.300
 create it will start to saturate the color and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.979
 the result is going to be pretty bad 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.979
 also that we can damage the 2nd 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.460
 although you can apply more 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.410
 layers as long as we have a paper 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 with a lot of texture in this case is a 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.840
 paper that has 125 grams of grammage what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.660
 which is pretty little so it's not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.430
 It is advisable to apply many layers 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.430
 generally three layers would be fine 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.610
 These pencils are made based on wax 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.290
 so it adapts very very quickly and 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.450
 just says they are quite expensive the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.940
 true if you do not have the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.890
 chances of buying them is not 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.780
 necessary these pencils are 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.729
 recommended from my point of view 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.009
 for people who want to get 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.009
 very very advanced results 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.710
 and I before using colored pencils or 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 pencils the character too but the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.760
 basic and you can also get 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.409
 very good results but never at a 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.719
 as professional level as these 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.770
 then as you see here I already begin to 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.969
 delimit the wolf of the flower and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.069
 obviously it is an equal process and 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.099
 complicated because this in pencils are not 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.290
 very not very thin very sharp puntana 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.230
 then with a cardboard carrier they have to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.280
 sharpen it very carefully and then 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.280
 they begin to fill it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.150
 as you can see the first layer is the color 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.040
 pink as I told you before and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 then we started to hat already with the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.200
 red color and then also because of the color 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.200
 black 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 and we can also do it the other way around 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.450
 we can see the oak layer and put it 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.129
 to the past to be the personal choice 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.590
 what I recommend is that the 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.989
 drawing you do it at the beginning with 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.200
 latex graphite as it is in this case 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.120
 here I can basically serve chepo 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.540
 We use it mostly for 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.010
 sketches I have a very smooth pencil and with 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.330
 that more than well the limits then 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.440
 after arriving almost and drawing 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.900
 already arrive and paint with pencils 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.380
 how are you saying they are made in 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.610
 base to wax can not be deleted by 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.610
 There is so much room for error 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.570
 and a very technical and very difficult job and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.080
 in complex but the results are 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.080
 amazing 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.180
 they only say so good even if you 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.489
 mix them with turpentine can 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.940
 Apply the works done with oil with 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.940
 painting 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.780
 in this case as are two flowers in this 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.120
 drawing that you perform the first 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.220
 flower and they always use it as 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.320
 reference to tonality and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.450
 nuance do not go very far away from the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.530
 another so that there is a certain balance 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.530
 between the two parties 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.000
 there is a type of the color bonus 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.390
 also one that's called benitin and those 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.130
 they are from very thin mines and that comes 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.150
 very good for the edges even though 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.799
 I have not used them yet, I know that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.660
 I buy later I will also do 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.760
 a tutorial of that so they know how 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.500
 No voice is applied in one way 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.500
 relatively correct 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.019
 this work is very slow then it is not 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.599
 It is recommended that you do it to the 

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:39.169
 quick you have to take the time to 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.759
 do what 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.759
 so that obviously looks good 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.919
 they can also shine with him with 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:59.260
 the white pencil of very intense video 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.260
 cold too from pretty small studio 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:06.770
 as it looks like 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.169
 here is let 's say from where the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.380
 flower there is also a kind of seven 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.139
 people between yellow with ducati very 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.120
 very clear 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.439
 they are parts pretty always next to 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.189
 the risk obviously the flower that is 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.189
 much more complex 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.630
 if you have a magnifying glass it is very 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.949
 It is also advisable to use it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.169
 obviously if you draw small you 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.749
 they do it in a much larger format 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.219
 it is not necessary in this case the sheet 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.159
 it's pretty pretty little bit small 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.479
 that very good also use a magnifying glass 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.090
 here as I start to mark the limit 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:46.020
 the outline of the leaf and with a green 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.449
 very clear I start to draw it paint it 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.590
 fill it very very well you know and then 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.590
 he applied a yellow color 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.910
 obviously after this the process is 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.190
 exactly like flowers 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.780
 a little less detailed because to me what 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.860
 What interests me is that the flowers of 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.860
 is that not so things 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.340
 here as in this flower the one below 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.530
 projected a kind of shadow on top of 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.960
 the other is also important that you 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.380
 well where they will set the shadows where 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.210
 are lighted colleges and so on and it 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.570
 they will reach realism levels very much 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.570
 greater 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:29.649
 so the process is basically the 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:31.689
 same so much for battles so much and the 

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:34.019
 background I know that you also want it 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.019
 do 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.270
 or that mark the limits apply to a 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.880
 load very light green so after 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.720
 we started applying it later on 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.850
 yellow color 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.280
 when we already have this base, we start 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.180
 hat from the corner and we achieved the 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.180
 effect we want 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.510
 obviously you can not record all the 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.260
 I'm drawing because as I told you, it's a 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.190
 drawing about 21 hours if not me 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.870
 agreement 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.940
 but the process is basically the same 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.370
 that the cream 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.990
 then as you see 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.210
 the result is there 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.220
 and good if you liked it, do not hesitate 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.290
 subscribe remember the videos are 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.240
 on Wednesdays so in that 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.240
 we'll see each other show
