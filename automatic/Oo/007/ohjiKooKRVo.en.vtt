00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
in business and in order to do so I'm

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.490 
in business and in order to do so I'm
not<00:03:42.209> saying<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:42.780> they<00:03:42.900> didn't<00:03:43.230> released

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
not saying that if they didn't released

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.440 
not saying that if they didn't released
on<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> xbox<00:03:43.739> one<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.550> would<00:03:44.700> just<00:03:44.730> sink<00:03:45.180> but

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
on the xbox one they would just sink but

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.479 
on the xbox one they would just sink but
they<00:03:45.780> would<00:03:45.959> make<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.110> lot<00:03:46.320> less<00:03:46.560> money<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.130> in

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
they would make a lot less money and in

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.740 
they would make a lot less money and in
turn<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.910> would<00:03:48.030> take<00:03:48.209> away<00:03:48.239> from<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
turn that would take away from the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.150 
turn that would take away from the
future<00:03:48.959> development<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.680> their<00:03:49.830> upcoming

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
future development of their upcoming

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.130 
future development of their upcoming
games<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> guess<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.570> comes<00:03:51.870> down<00:03:51.989> to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
games so I guess it really comes down to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.680 
games so I guess it really comes down to
what<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.769> more<00:03:52.980> important<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.600> you

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
what is more important to you do you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.990 
what is more important to you do you
really<00:03:54.930> care<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.320> much<00:03:55.620> about<00:03:55.860> drm<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.910> if

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
really care that much about drm and if

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.460 
really care that much about drm and if
you're<00:03:57.150> one<00:03:57.300> of<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.480> people<00:03:57.660> who<00:03:57.900> won't<00:03:58.260> have

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
you're one of the people who won't have
