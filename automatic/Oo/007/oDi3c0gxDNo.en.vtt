00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.260 
and stuff but it may make just a small
difference

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
difference

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.410 
difference
I<00:02:39.440> doubt<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.940> see<00:02:42.120> how<00:02:42.270> it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
I doubt it really but we can see how it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.449 
I doubt it really but we can see how it
goes<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.560> fact<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.950> got<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.190> bit<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
goes the fact that I got a bit of a

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.760 
goes the fact that I got a bit of a
bigger<00:02:44.670> car<00:02:45.000> may<00:02:45.360> kind<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:45.990> outweighed<00:02:46.709> by

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
bigger car may kind of be outweighed by

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.170 
bigger car may kind of be outweighed by
the<00:02:47.040> maybe<00:02:47.430> there's<00:02:47.760> slightly<00:02:48.000> better

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the maybe there's slightly better

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.120 
the maybe there's slightly better
modifications<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.170> product<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:49.860> not
