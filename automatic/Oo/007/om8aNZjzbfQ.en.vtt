kind of make it look as seamless as

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.720 
kind of make it look as seamless as
possible

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.480 

and<00:01:55.730> then<00:01:56.090> again<00:01:56.420> with<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.950> 28-piece<00:01:57.950> neutral

and then again with a 28-piece neutral

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.030 
and then again with a 28-piece neutral
palette<00:01:58.940> I'm<00:01:59.120> choosing<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.230> brown<00:02:00.620> shade

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
palette I'm choosing this brown shade

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.710 
palette I'm choosing this brown shade
right<00:02:01.250> here<00:02:01.310> which<00:02:01.730> is<00:02:01.880> pretty<00:02:02.150> much<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.390> very

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
right here which is pretty much a very

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.920 
right here which is pretty much a very
basic<00:02:02.960> Brown<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.860> I'm<00:02:04.460> using<00:02:04.730> this<00:02:05.120> as<00:02:05.420> an

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
basic Brown and I'm using this as an

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.529 
basic Brown and I'm using this as an
eyeliner<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.460> doesn't<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:07.970> be<00:02:08.119> very

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
eyeliner so this doesn't have to be very

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.120 
eyeliner so this doesn't have to be very
nice<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.200> smooth<00:02:09.500> because<00:02:09.679> we're<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:10.070> to

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
nice and smooth because we're going to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.760 
nice and smooth because we're going to
go<00:02:10.310> ahead<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.729> smudge<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.630> out<00:02:11.720> later<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:12.740> I

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
go ahead and smudge it out later but I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.080 
go ahead and smudge it out later but I
kind<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.280> want<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.820> close<00:02:14.060> to
