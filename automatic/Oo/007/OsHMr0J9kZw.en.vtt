00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
from the bottom here how long does that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389

into<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> slower<00:02:24.240> spot<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.590> move<00:02:25.770> these<00:02:25.920> other

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
into a slower spot and move these other

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.150 
into a slower spot and move these other
ones<00:02:26.370> onto<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.910> little<00:02:27.210> higher<00:02:27.390> heat<00:02:28.100> now<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
ones onto a little higher heat now you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.830 
ones onto a little higher heat now you
don't<00:02:29.460> continue<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.910> base<00:02:30.180> these<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
don't continue to base these right the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.510 
don't continue to base these right the
oil<00:02:30.870> was<00:02:31.200> enough<00:02:31.410> no<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.890> brush<00:02:32.130> them<00:02:32.280> once

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
oil was enough no just brush them once

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.950 
oil was enough no just brush them once
and<00:02:32.820> then<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.330> flip<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.810> about

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
and then you can just flip how about

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.420 
and then you can just flip how about
these<00:02:34.080> potatoes<00:02:34.590> are<00:02:34.620> these<00:02:34.920> partially
