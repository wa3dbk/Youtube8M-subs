00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.810

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.789
 why why why why why 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.920

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.970
 cerebral embolism to uncle look see is 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.770
 making the human star and sure 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.050
 I do not die if I die, I do not know why 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.820
 I'm the only one who commits suicide there's no other 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.970
 who has committed suicide because this happens to me 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.560
 to me because my mother, boy, well, well, 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.749
 nothing we are here in a little game in the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.359
 I do not know what to do are here 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.769
 apparently fighting at the beginning 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.600
 they are fighting they are taking a beating 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.210
 human and maygar is a piece of ramp 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.150
 incredible to fly my mother I think that 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.220
 those who were fighting was because 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.960
 because directly my mother my mother 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.000
 because they did not have a bicycle directly 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.830
 and they were on my bike give it to me 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.950
 give it back to me and now the question is 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.690
 how do you fly around here my mother 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.480
 I'm going to do one of my own 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.270
 troll 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.230
 hello my name is machine and I'm a troll 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.840
 see you later 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.440
 aver if someone dies, okay, let's go, let's go 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.940
 we go pedal pedales pedal and it's 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.420
 very difficult is my mother 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.520
 to see this is not difficult there are 104 there 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 if they are not and we're going, I think it's not 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.850
 you have to pedal 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.870
 be careful because here it moves 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:29.500
 very much let's go let's go let's go 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.440
 I was under eye but and this as how 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.900
 you skip this is that we're going to see this is 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.300
 a little strange and at the same time I can 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.550
 throw a shotgun mother of mine is that 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.740

 here for pedal vale is pedal 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.670

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.280
 inert bodies as they have already arrived 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.990
 or that they have arrived and I what I want 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.970
 to reach my goal is to arrive directly 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.530
 one has arrived in the first place and I suppose 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.940
 that the second one is going to arrive too 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.830

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.550
