00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
is one part marine clean to five parts

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.910 
is one part marine clean to five parts
water<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.570> light<00:02:51.810> use<00:02:52.200> would<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.470> one

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
water and just a light use would be one

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.990

I'm<00:02:57.060> not<00:02:57.180> gonna<00:02:57.330> go<00:02:57.510> over<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.720> test<00:02:58.110> data<00:02:58.470> I

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
I'm not gonna go over this test data I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.760 
I'm not gonna go over this test data I
mean<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.190> look<00:02:59.370> at<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.940> see

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
mean you can look at that and see

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.260 
mean you can look at that and see
materials<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:01.980> service<00:03:02.400> compatibilities

now<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.320> one<00:03:04.560> that's<00:03:04.740> really<00:03:05.070> compatible

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
now this is one that's really compatible

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.699 
now this is one that's really compatible
with<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> lot<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.360> products<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.050> notice

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
with a lot of products and notice

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.010 
with a lot of products and notice
there's<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.980> star<00:03:08.250> down<00:03:08.430> here<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.940> says

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
there's a star down here it says

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.780 
there's a star down here it says
exposure<00:03:10.020> should<00:03:10.440> be<00:03:10.590> limited<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.220> brief

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
exposure should be limited to brief

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.630 
exposure should be limited to brief
periods<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.420> time<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.380> has<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.950> star<00:03:14.250> like

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
periods of time so has the star like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.780 
periods of time so has the star like
here<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:15.000> bronze<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.050> brass<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.770> know<00:03:17.280> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
here on bronze and brass you know you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.979 
here on bronze and brass you know you
should<00:03:18.500> exposure<00:03:19.500> should<00:03:19.769> be<00:03:19.890> limited<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.989> it

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
should exposure should be limited so it

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.290 
should exposure should be limited so it
is<00:03:22.140> compatible<00:03:22.530> with<00:03:22.830> stainless<00:03:23.730> steel<00:03:23.970> iron

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
is compatible with stainless steel iron

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.500 
is compatible with stainless steel iron

so<00:03:40.920> again<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.459> compatible<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.209> lot

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
so again this is compatible with a lot

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.840 
so again this is compatible with a lot
of<00:03:42.540> different<00:03:42.780> products<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.980> marine<00:03:44.519> clean

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
of different products so marine clean

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.420 
of different products so marine clean
this<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.959> be<00:03:46.080> used<00:03:46.350> it's<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.709> degreaser

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
this can be used it's a degreaser

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
this can be used it's a degreaser
cleaner<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.840> used<00:03:49.080> for<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.290> lot<00:03:49.530> of

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
cleaner that can be used for a lot of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.560 
cleaner that can be used for a lot of
different<00:03:49.650> applications<00:03:50.430> but<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.030> also<00:03:51.269> the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
different applications but it's also the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.540 
different applications but it's also the
first<00:03:51.900> step<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.500> you're<00:03:52.650> using<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.040> for<00:03:53.100> rust

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
first step if you're using this for rust

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.300 
first step if you're using this for rust
like<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.940> did<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.269> Mustang<00:03:54.630> project<00:03:55.310> where

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
like I did on the Mustang project where

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.790 
like I did on the Mustang project where
you<00:03:56.459> clean<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.970> metal<00:03:57.120> really<00:03:57.690> good<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.290> then

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
you clean the metal really good and then

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.130 
you clean the metal really good and then
you<00:03:58.950> rinse<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.489> off<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.970> water<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:01.050> you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
you rinse it off with water and then you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.080 
you rinse it off with water and then you
put<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.440> metal<00:04:01.680> ready<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.220> there<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.970> then

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
put the metal ready on there and then

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.970 
put the metal ready on there and then
you'll<00:04:03.239> rinse<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:04.019> off<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.500> then<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.680> can

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
you'll rinse that off and then you can

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.780 
you'll rinse that off and then you can
put<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> por-15<00:04:06.180> coating<00:04:06.959> on<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:08.220> anyway<00:04:08.580> that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
put the por-15 coating on so anyway that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.280 
put the por-15 coating on so anyway that
wraps<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.300> video<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.989> hope<00:04:10.110> this

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
wraps up this video and I hope this

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.380 
wraps up this video and I hope this
helps<00:04:10.590> answer<00:04:10.769> any<00:04:11.040> questions<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.180> may
