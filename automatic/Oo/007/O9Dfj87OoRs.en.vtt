00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.859
 welcome ladies and gentlemen today a piece 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.640
 time for you to tidy up 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.040
 never did it so far 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.480
 I like it I like a team 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 it 's only that old so there will be many 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.980
 changes take place there 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 as soon as I want to make transfer fee and so do I 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 invested a whole lot more 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.300
 i will tell all kinds of story in relation to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.470
 the first match because here it is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 we start against us we start 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 stormy majolica cala d'or send me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.500
 does not pop right in front 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.939
 something that unluckily void also a whole 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.789
 good chance if rooney received the ball 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.380
 van van persie aimed at the left arrow 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.120
 very unfortunate but then you know that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 goal drink to flat sir for 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.230
 rest 5 minutes before getting it from van 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 press the role of nani in those buns 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.739
 with his left in the far corner 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.140
 goalie can't do anything I believe 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.120
 I was here as small is the heart 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 is i can not miss its but rather 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.039
 attacks on in a 352 with the teams like that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 tasty fries and still very good 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 jones and narrow in its great central 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 defenders in which the second half what 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 less high but ten minutes 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.140
 about rest after paper 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 they head the ball inside siku person 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.040
 receive the ball from sacco for his 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.840
 that head a fine along here yes but 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.250
 five minutes later again as van persie 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.170
 the banks bare 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.689
 has that space and it hits him in the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.630
 short angle that guy is overpowered in 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.430
 Everyone abused and so we cargo 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 he made two one of 63 minutes 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.780
 played and from the press 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 yes i don't know i don't like you 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.689
 of course and that has different 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.860
 reasons 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.900
 also because of north and or and are 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.430
 of course but not just la wicks 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.990
 brings to the form, but it is good 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 already reasonable with a he does not play 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 bad 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.070
 here well put him he gets 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 or weather baker who makes his cohen 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.920
 second round match three 168 minutes 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.259
 played and cacoa is really one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.149
 world player in the game really how 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.140
 easy he still players holes how fast 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.820
 that is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.290
 is just amazing it is so god is too 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.970
 really really good 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.680
 but well then the almost comes to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.450
 Finally, a short hour's soggy ball 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.920
 gives who gives the man of persie who 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 gives a by elroni 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.549
 and then your brother goes on purpose or all of her 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.540
 shook off at night and you know what 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.540
 going to come 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.909
 when we tea coal by tom cleverley he 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.879
 makes four one of 82 minutes 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.289
 played and the match has been played and 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.590
 reason day before that suede went like me 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.840
 wanted every chance of a possible 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.280
 avoid closure and I was n't sure 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.330
 or green number 1 would each be their 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.830
 left foot 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
 anyway we win with four one one 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.890
 good result 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.349
 because yes we are still on the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.959
 seventh place I believe to be the first 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.569
 competition match was this forest or not 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.340
 I don't know that anymore but well the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.410
 next race in the hood in the ft-iq 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.299
 would be against wigan if everything is right 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.709
 but that is not the case again 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.360
 but good you sieneke 2 scouts now 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.950
 both 5 close judgment and that is anyway 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.959
 especially important 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.180
 how I never get x-perience from that anymore 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.590
 how many players is cold there but I put 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.849
 they in their own country that often takes care of it 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.769
 on better players 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.260
 I'm so so so but a shot in the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.819
 hissing couple in scotland and in turkey 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.410
 I didn't scout it often I do it 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.420
 most about something england south america 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.760
 that kind of countries but that shot your 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.290
 and I was very upset about it after me 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.269
 just for short what I still church I do wa 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.560
 will put some up most guests here 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.209
 weren't really up yet but yes me 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 have only two and three matches with them 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.790
 played 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.549
 I think there is in many growth 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.049
 henricus as players and as those below 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.790
 they still have a lot of potential 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.840
 I think it's all next years 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.220
 coming 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.630
 but well we also go I would fielder 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.569
 statistics show rooney here 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.400
 light for our team with 18 goals 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.049
 the score pretty much also rooney light 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.970
 also for our team and press assists 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.120
 also has a few same ones 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.440
 the one in the GA already has eleven clean sheets 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.090
 was therefore has two red bottle 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.349
 cards that movie a bit like I had 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.090
 do not expect aggressive one 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.069
 was good we see little bit there 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.109
 set up a scouting network and we go too 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.549
 another game against practice rooms 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.959
 wanders with the capital one cup and 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.940
 who can really be stolen will 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.950
 but I can really advise that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.680
 whoever gets stolen only 100,000 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.660
 or as much as you blind and as a visit eon 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.980
 yes there you have nothing to the 100,000 even 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.900
 a fourth division club of the Netherlands and 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.190
 I am about a hundred thousand but okay me 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.480
 just want to simulate you see her flight 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.970
 you also get rooney filming right away 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.810
 made a zero then 15 minutes and then 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.660
 it went pretty easy 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.310
 valencia after 35 minutes for 2 0 for us 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.139
 can also zuma the cacoa ring still makes 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.150
 a goal in the 64th 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.010
 and stir it now in the 77th minute 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.900
 enter zero in at the cup final 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.760
 the capital one cup which of course is 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.319
 important for me there 100 xp 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 level 25 I have a new version 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.130
 of the scout ii future star that is 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.570
 then again it is a joke expensive than a piece 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.979
 we'll be better so I 'm curious about myself 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.930
 to 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.979
 definitely see if i will do that if 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.420
 you want to see that just comes 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.400
 reaction 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.960
 let's get better but good we have a pot 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.090
 against west ham in light it for in the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 competition and stir already here it goes 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.680
 very early along with a great man 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.360
 shot but your keeper wooden unfortunately and so 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.710
 went the whole match here too you see 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.420
 so with 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.190
 I played Robocraft for fifteen minutes 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.990
 ballroom that gives him back 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.730
 week no offside spence can 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.770
 don't keep a bang team 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.840
 flawless ar down the middle 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.360
 danny welbeck what a great player 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.170
 is that he has so much potential or he 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.540
 is but I think 23 something and he has 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.040
 so much talent he can run very well 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.570
 good man can pass is one 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.370
 shot is also fantastic i don't know 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.900
 what about headlines but good I do 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.980
 it doesn't make so many couples that 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.390
 not off 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.770
 and there is in the second half it was 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.660
 not as exciting as against wolf space 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.850
 but incredibly annoying moment 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.220
 my controller just disappeared 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.710
 was a bit less but a one the cost now 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.240
 saw it there very annoying and and must 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.550
 I attack again I don't feel like me 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.340
 form ' would rather not go under pressure but 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.590
 good weather in the 63rd minute goes rooney 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.150
 very easy to pass direct man and 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.920
 put him in the past the goalkeeper 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.530
 goalkeeper to score a very simple one 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 and rooney is really very good as a striker 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.680
 people less that less because he 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.980
 Double eyes workrate but has moffat 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.660
 is good and then in the 77th minute ornamental 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.890
 once moments final chord you for 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.500
 Danny Welbeck 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.940
 his second of the match and he goes 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.950
 very good mail idea he will be anyway 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.750
 follows seasons as replacement of van persie 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.310
 it is now 30 years old and if I still pay 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.750
 box of which there might exchange for 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.880
 a good boy striker then that would be bad 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.980
 be nice but get here this way 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.720
 anderson still gets the ball from nani and 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.980
 this is the real final agreement than here 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.230
 made four here 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.120
 one of those that each opposed 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.810
 calling but well there can be 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.910
 be worked 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.830
 where is that beautiful ball from after that on 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.230
 anderson who dribbles past a direct one 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.510
 man and he just puts it in the net 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.340
 to make four of them and that's the 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.150
 end position logically lean with four 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.620
 a 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.210
 This means that we are rising to the and 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.830
 60 placements I believe next 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.390
 match against liverpool 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.580
 I do hope you like this video
