a few weeks ago I went to Facebook and
asked<00:00:02.580> people<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.270> can<00:00:03.780> destroy<00:00:04.290> books<00:00:04.710> and

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
asked people how I can destroy books and

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.740 
asked people how I can destroy books and
people<00:00:05.670> did<00:00:05.790> not<00:00:05.970> disappoint

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750

Johnston<00:00:09.900> put<00:00:10.620> Fahrenheit<00:00:11.160> 451<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:12.179> an<00:00:12.330> oven

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
Johnston put Fahrenheit 451 in an oven

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.120 
Johnston put Fahrenheit 451 in an oven
set<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> 452<00:00:14.370> let's<00:00:15.240> test<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.049> love<00:00:16.830> this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
set to 452 let's test this I love this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.620 
set to 452 let's test this I love this
because<00:00:17.460> involves<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.330> favorite

because involves two of my favorite

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.380 
because involves two of my favorite
things<00:00:18.869> science<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.970> science

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
things science and not really science

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.109 
things science and not really science
I'll<00:00:21.930> explain<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> bit<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.279> let's<00:00:23.970> get

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I'll explain a bit but first let's get

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.519 
I'll explain a bit but first let's get
this<00:00:24.240> book<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:24.720> oven

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.580 

here's<00:00:31.529> Ray<00:00:31.769> Bradbury's<00:00:32.520> Fahrenheit<00:00:32.550> 451

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
here's Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
here's Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451
that<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> oven<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> know

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that right here in the oven and you know

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240 
that right here in the oven and you know
just<00:00:37.110> give<00:00:37.230> him<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.469> company<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.129> go

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
just give him some company let's go

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
just give him some company let's go
ahead<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.460> put<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> Sylvia<00:00:39.000> Plath<00:00:39.300> book<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
ahead and put a Sylvia Plath book in

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.170 
ahead and put a Sylvia Plath book in
there<00:00:39.899> why<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.920> she<00:00:41.129> seems<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.000> she

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
there why because she seems like she

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.250 
there why because she seems like she
would<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.480> home<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:42.899> oven

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
would be at home in an oven

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
would be at home in an oven
whoa-oh-oh-oh<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.399> go<00:00:44.489> crazy<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> not

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
whoa-oh-oh-oh don't go crazy that is not

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
whoa-oh-oh-oh don't go crazy that is not
a<00:00:45.510> holocaust<00:00:46.079> joke<00:00:46.230> okay<00:00:47.100> despite<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a holocaust joke okay despite the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.459 
a holocaust joke okay despite the
implications<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.450> Sylvia<00:00:48.809> Plath's<00:00:49.050> poem

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
implications of Sylvia Plath's poem

Plath<00:00:55.890> killed<00:00:56.160> herself<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.699> sticking<00:00:57.030> her

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Plath killed herself by sticking her

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569 
Plath killed herself by sticking her
head<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.600> oven<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> suicide<00:00:59.010> joke

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
head in an oven so it's a suicide joke

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.729 
head in an oven so it's a suicide joke
which<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.719> better<00:01:03.049> now<00:01:04.049> before<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.559> on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
which is much better now before we go on

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
which is much better now before we go on
and<00:01:04.860> monitor<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> progress<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and monitor the progress of this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730 
and monitor the progress of this
experiment<00:01:06.960> let<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> explain

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
experiment let me back up and explain

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500 
experiment let me back up and explain
why<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.070> isn't<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:08.610> science<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.360> are

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
why this isn't really science there are

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
why this isn't really science there are
a<00:01:09.540> few<00:01:09.689> problems<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.619> firstly<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
a few problems with this firstly you can

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.100 
a few problems with this firstly you can
see<00:01:11.700> by<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.880> video<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.960> oven

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
see by this video that I have an oven

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
see by this video that I have an oven
from<00:01:13.380> apparently<00:01:13.860> 1912<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.030> analog<00:01:15.509> radial

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
from apparently 1912 the analog radial

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.249 
from apparently 1912 the analog radial
button<00:01:16.080> prevents<00:01:16.920> accurate<00:01:17.670> temperature

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
button prevents accurate temperature

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.969 
button prevents accurate temperature
alignments<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.619> no<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
alignments so there's really no way I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.480 
alignments so there's really no way I
can<00:01:20.430> isolate<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> degree<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> 451<00:01:23.250> let

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
can isolate to the degree of 451 let

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
can isolate to the degree of 451 let
alone<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> degree<00:01:24.119> 450<00:01:24.810> which<00:01:25.259> would<00:01:25.500> be

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
alone the degree 450 which would be

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
alone the degree 450 which would be
required<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.340> order<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> create<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.420> true<00:01:27.750> valid

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
required in order to create a true valid

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
required in order to create a true valid
experiment<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:29.880> external

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
experiment also I don't have an external

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
experiment also I don't have an external
thermometer<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.079> can't<00:01:31.320> verify<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
thermometer so I can't verify the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190 
thermometer so I can't verify the
temperature<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.360> oven<00:01:33.390> even<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> could

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
temperature of the oven even if I could

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.420 
temperature of the oven even if I could
precisely<00:01:34.560> dial<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.220> into<00:01:35.850> 450<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.540> 451<00:01:37.430> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
precisely dial it in into 450 or 451 but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
precisely dial it in into 450 or 451 but
it's<00:01:38.909> an<00:01:39.030> excuse<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> put<00:01:39.479> books<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.869> an<00:01:39.960> oven

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's an excuse to put books in an oven

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
it's an excuse to put books in an oven
so<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.759> second<00:01:42.090> reason

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so I'm going to do it the second reason

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.510 
so I'm going to do it the second reason
why<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:42.960> unscientific

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
why this is a very unscientific

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.190 
why this is a very unscientific
experiment<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.479> hypothesis

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
experiment is because the hypothesis

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
experiment is because the hypothesis
that<00:01:46.380> paper<00:01:46.619> burns<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.299> 451<00:01:48.299> degrees

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that paper burns at 451 degrees

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
that paper burns at 451 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.460> failed<00:01:50.460> hypothesis<00:01:51.270> from

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
Fahrenheit is a failed hypothesis from

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.819 
Fahrenheit is a failed hypothesis from
the<00:01:51.720> beginning<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.680> already

time right now to ask you to leave in
the<00:02:36.030> comments<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.810> temperature<00:02:37.200> at<00:02:37.380> which

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the comments the temperature at which

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
the comments the temperature at which
you<00:02:37.560> think<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.160> book<00:02:38.370> will<00:02:38.580> ignite<00:02:38.880> if<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you think this book will ignite if it

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.940 
you think this book will ignite if it
does<00:02:39.570> ignite<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.500> think<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.830> would<00:02:40.920> be

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
does ignite I think that would be

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.290 
does ignite I think that would be
interesting<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.550> plus<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.790> need<00:02:41.940> something<00:02:42.240> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
interesting and plus I need something to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.630 
interesting and plus I need something to
pass<00:02:42.480> more<00:02:42.720> time<00:02:42.959> or<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.130> use<00:02:44.250> camera

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
pass more time or I can use camera

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.810 
pass more time or I can use camera
tricks<00:02:44.910> let's<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.420> go<00:02:45.540> ahead<00:02:45.630> ah<00:02:49.760> look<00:02:50.760> at

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
tricks let's just go ahead ah look at

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.510 
tricks let's just go ahead ah look at
that<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.739> burning<00:02:56.690> there<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.930> fire<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.489> I

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
that it's burning there is fire what I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.729 
that it's burning there is fire what I
think<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.850> really<00:03:00.450> cool<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:01.530> whole

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
think is really cool about this whole

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.750 
think is really cool about this whole
experiment<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.930> Sylvia<00:03:04.830> Plath<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.580> bell

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
experiment is that Sylvia Plath the bell

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300 
experiment is that Sylvia Plath the bell
jar<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:07.170> book<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> survived<00:03:07.980> who<00:03:08.190> would

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
jar is the book that survived who would

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.060 
jar is the book that survived who would
have<00:03:08.400> thought<00:03:08.570> Sylvia<00:03:09.570> Plath<00:03:09.860> would<00:03:10.860> be<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
have thought Sylvia Plath would be the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.920 
have thought Sylvia Plath would be the
one<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.310> survive<00:03:11.459> an<00:03:11.730> oven<00:03:12.530> that's<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:14.930> suicide

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
one to survive an oven that's to suicide

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.610 
one to survive an oven that's to suicide
via<00:03:16.560> oven<00:03:16.920> jokes<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.459> one<00:03:17.940> video<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:18.989> bad<00:03:19.200> not
