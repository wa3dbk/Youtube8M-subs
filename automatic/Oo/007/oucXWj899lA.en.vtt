so<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.110> just<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.469> quick<00:00:01.800> overview<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.550> how

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so this is just a quick overview of how

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.059 
so this is just a quick overview of how
the<00:00:02.879> cart<00:00:03.480> works

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
the cart works

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.810 
the cart works
there's<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.819> snowblower<00:00:06.299> engine<00:00:07.220> which<00:00:08.220> sat

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
there's the snowblower engine which sat

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.450 
there's the snowblower engine which sat
in<00:00:09.000> my<00:00:09.120> grandpa's<00:00:09.570> garage<00:00:09.809> for<00:00:10.139> like<00:00:10.170> 10<00:00:11.130> 20

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
in my grandpa's garage for like 10 20

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.129 
in my grandpa's garage for like 10 20
years<00:00:12.559> it<00:00:13.559> only<00:00:13.710> had<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.809> work<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
years it only had to do was work on the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.410 
years it only had to do was work on the
carb<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.400> valve<00:00:17.640> got<00:00:17.940> messed<00:00:18.210> up

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
carb because we the valve got messed up

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.859 
carb because we the valve got messed up
but<00:00:19.130> other<00:00:20.130> than<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.420> had<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
but other than that we just had to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
but other than that we just had to
change<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.529> oil<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.100> works<00:00:23.310> fine<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:25.580> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
change the oil and it works fine and so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.070 
change the oil and it works fine and so
we<00:00:27.420> added<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.720> kill<00:00:27.960> switch<00:00:28.429> up<00:00:30.050> below<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we added a kill switch up below the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.340 
we added a kill switch up below the
steering<00:00:31.619> wheel<00:00:31.940> where<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.660> key<00:00:33.899> slot<00:00:34.170> would

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
steering wheel where the key slot would

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.650 
steering wheel where the key slot would
be<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:35.010> close<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.290> that's<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
be pretty close to so that's just a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
be pretty close to so that's just a
toggle<00:00:40.399> kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> thing<00:00:42.200> on<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
toggle kind of thing on or off and that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.540 
toggle kind of thing on or off and that
just<00:00:44.280> shorts<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> spark<00:00:45.570> plug<00:00:45.809> so

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
just shorts out the spark plug so

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
just shorts out the spark plug so
nothing<00:00:47.550> ignites<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.210> gas<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> mission

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
nothing ignites the gas in the mission

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.090 
nothing ignites the gas in the mission
though<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.850> engine<00:00:51.120> doesn't<00:00:51.329> run<00:00:51.570> anymore

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
though the engine doesn't run anymore

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
though the engine doesn't run anymore
and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.550> flip<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and then you can flip it on and then you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.250 
and then you can flip it on and then you
can<00:00:55.289> start<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.780> there's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.870> pull

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
can start it and then there's a pull

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
can start it and then there's a pull
starter<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:58.859> an<00:00:58.949> electric<00:00:59.340> starter<00:00:59.730> electric

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
starter or an electric starter electric

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
starter or an electric starter electric
starter<00:01:00.780> area<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.230> plug<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.890> wall

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
starter area to plug it into a wall

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.109 
starter area to plug it into a wall
socket<00:01:02.129> though<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> usually<00:01:04.140> use<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.119> pulse

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
socket though so I usually use the pulse

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.859 
socket though so I usually use the pulse
start<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> electric<00:01:09.270> start<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.630> already

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
start and the electric start was already

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
start and the electric start was already
on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> snowblower<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> first<00:01:11.610> place

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
on the snowblower in the first place

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.859 
on the snowblower in the first place
and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> choke<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.869> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and then they have the choke and the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.120 
and then they have the choke and the
exhaust<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:17.570> used<00:01:18.570> gas<00:01:18.840> piping<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.950> can

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
exhaust we used gas piping which you can

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
exhaust we used gas piping which you can
just<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.549> cast<00:01:20.820> iron<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just it's cast iron you can just get it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.590 
just it's cast iron you can just get it
from<00:01:21.840> Home<00:01:22.380> Depot<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:22.740> whatever<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.450> normal

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
from Home Depot or whatever the normal

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.050 
from Home Depot or whatever the normal
hardware<00:01:25.110> store<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> drive<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
hardware store and then the drive to the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.280 
hardware store and then the drive to the
snowblower<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.950> belt<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> goes<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> jack

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
snowblower is belt and it goes to a jack

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.359 
snowblower is belt and it goes to a jack
shaft<00:01:34.970> which<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.780> thing<00:01:38.060> right<00:01:39.060> there

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
shaft which is this thing right there

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.429 
shaft which is this thing right there
and<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> brake<00:01:42.810> disc<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and that just has a brake disc on it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.359 
and that just has a brake disc on it
from<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.890> snowmobile<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.540> has<00:01:46.189> that's<00:01:47.189> an

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
from a snowmobile and that has that's an

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.880 
from a snowmobile and that has that's an
eight-inch<00:01:47.759> brake<00:01:48.030> disc<00:01:48.710> what's<00:01:49.710> not

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
eight-inch brake disc what's not

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.240 
eight-inch brake disc what's not
hydraulic<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
hydraulic it's just a

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.150 
hydraulic it's just a
cable<00:01:53.120> powered<00:01:53.450> but<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:54.530> can<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.830> plenty<00:01:54.980> of

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
cable powered but we can get plenty of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.730 
cable powered but we can get plenty of
leverage<00:01:55.400> which<00:01:55.850> I'll<00:01:56.030> explain<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.480> minute

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
leverage which I'll explain in a minute

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.880 
leverage which I'll explain in a minute
and<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.070> also<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.790> clutch<00:01:59.150> lever

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
and then we also have the clutch lever

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.290 
and then we also have the clutch lever
which<00:02:01.180> pivots<00:02:02.180> on<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:02.630> axle<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:04.300> when

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
which pivots on this axle and then when

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.710 
which pivots on this axle and then when
you<00:02:05.420> pull<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:08.740> clutch<00:02:09.740> handle<00:02:10.240> forward<00:02:11.240> it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
you pull the clutch handle forward it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.990 
you pull the clutch handle forward it
latches<00:02:16.480> kind<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.660> needs<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.650> work<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
latches kind of needs a little work and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.830 
latches kind of needs a little work and
then<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.510> puts<00:02:20.990> tension<00:02:21.320> on<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.830> cable

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
then that puts tension on the cable

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.760 
then that puts tension on the cable
which<00:02:23.840> lifts<00:02:24.410> up<00:02:24.590> these<00:02:24.800> two<00:02:25.250> oak<00:02:25.580> arms<00:02:26.770> which

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
which lifts up these two oak arms which

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.800 
which lifts up these two oak arms which
puts<00:02:28.520> tension<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.240> belt<00:02:29.360> through<00:02:29.660> an

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
puts tension on the belt through an

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.430 
puts tension on the belt through an
idler<00:02:30.170> pulley<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.550> spins<00:02:32.140> there's<00:02:33.140> plenty

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
idler pulley but it spins there's plenty

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370 
idler pulley but it spins there's plenty
of<00:02:33.470> tension<00:02:33.890> there<00:02:34.870> when<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:36.200> go

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
of tension there when they go

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.470 
of tension there when they go
that<00:02:36.710> gives<00:02:37.250> part<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.700> jack<00:02:37.910> shaft<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
that gives part of the jack shaft so the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.160 
that gives part of the jack shaft so the
jack<00:02:38.690> shaft<00:02:38.990> starts<00:02:39.380> spinning<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:41.840> from

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
jack shaft starts spinning and then from

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.270 
jack shaft starts spinning and then from
the<00:02:42.260> jack<00:02:42.470> shaft<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.810> listing<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> belt

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the jack shaft we have listing the belt

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.830 
the jack shaft we have listing the belt
which<00:02:46.280> will<00:02:46.490> then<00:02:46.670> go<00:02:46.880> down<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.090> our<00:02:47.300> wheel<00:02:47.570> but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
which will then go down to our wheel but

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.500 
which will then go down to our wheel but
the<00:02:48.020> wheel<00:02:48.170> right<00:02:48.350> now<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.740> gone<00:02:49.480> because<00:02:50.480> it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
the wheel right now is gone because it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.990 
the wheel right now is gone because it
broke<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.300> I'm<00:02:53.300> getting<00:02:53.810> them<00:02:53.900> out<00:02:54.020> back<00:02:54.230> soon

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
broke so I'm getting them out back soon

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.479 
broke so I'm getting them out back soon
when<00:02:56.000> they<00:02:56.120> were<00:02:56.180> reinforced<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.260> then

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
when they were reinforced it and then

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.640 
when they were reinforced it and then
the<00:02:58.489> brake<00:02:58.730> how<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.030> get<00:02:59.360> enough<00:02:59.570> leverage<00:03:00.260> is

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
the brake how we get enough leverage is

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.210 
the brake how we get enough leverage is
there's<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.100> little<00:03:01.459> sheath<00:03:01.880> cable<00:03:03.010> which<00:03:04.010> goes

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
there's a little sheath cable which goes

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.640 
there's a little sheath cable which goes
back<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.600> lever<00:03:05.900> which<00:03:06.650> works<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:08.650> which

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
back to a lever which works as a which

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.340 
back to a lever which works as a which
works<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.489> an<00:03:10.640> emergency<00:03:10.940> brake<00:03:11.420> it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
works is just an emergency brake it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.060 
works is just an emergency brake it
moves<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:13.040> half<00:03:13.970> an<00:03:14.180> inch<00:03:14.360> but<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.890> do

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
moves like half an inch but it can do

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.420 
moves like half an inch but it can do
enough<00:03:16.370> leverage<00:03:16.610> or<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.890> push<00:03:19.160> on<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
enough leverage or you can push on the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.740 
enough leverage or you can push on the
pedal<00:03:19.790> which<00:03:20.480> pulls<00:03:20.930> on<00:03:21.110> this<00:03:21.260> cable<00:03:22.480> goes<00:03:23.480> up

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
pedal which pulls on this cable goes up

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.630 
pedal which pulls on this cable goes up
through<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:25.000> logical<00:03:26.000> conduit<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.870> it's

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
through this logical conduit but it's

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.070 
through this logical conduit but it's
mechanical<00:03:28.640> cable<00:03:29.060> which<00:03:29.330> goes<00:03:29.570> down<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.959> the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
mechanical cable which goes down to the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.920 
mechanical cable which goes down to the
pedal<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.940> push<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.630> pulls<00:03:32.840> on

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
pedal so you push on that it pulls on

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.220 
pedal so you push on that it pulls on
whatever<00:03:33.610> which<00:03:34.610> then<00:03:34.910> activates<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.050> brake

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
whatever which then activates the brake

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.850 
whatever which then activates the brake
disc<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.690> slows<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.870> down<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.680> also

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
disc and slows it down and then I also

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.720 
disc and slows it down and then I also
made<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.459> quick<00:03:40.790> feature<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.590> parking<00:03:43.130> brake

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
made a quick feature of a parking brake

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.610 
made a quick feature of a parking brake
when<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.569> engage<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.050> just<00:03:46.890> far<00:03:47.310> enough

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.250 

we<00:03:52.620> engage<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.250> far<00:03:53.430> enough<00:03:53.520> then<00:03:54.260> it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
we engage it just far enough then it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.770 
we engage it just far enough then it
locks<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> brake<00:03:55.860> discs<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.310> place<00:03:56.550> or<00:03:56.849> you

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
locks the brake discs in place or you

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.839 
locks the brake discs in place or you
can<00:03:58.170> unlatch<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.800> slide<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.700> block

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
can unlatch it and slide the block

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.780 
can unlatch it and slide the block
forward<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:03.540> there's<00:04:04.170> no<00:04:04.790> parking

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
forward and then there's no parking

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.400 
forward and then there's no parking
brake<00:04:06.030> because<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.569> doesn't<00:04:06.840> slide<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.200> far

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
brake because it doesn't slide that far

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.970 
brake because it doesn't slide that far
for<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:09.709> yeah<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:11.580> have<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.769> one

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
for it and yeah we have a it's a one

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.210 
for it and yeah we have a it's a one
wheel<00:04:14.130> drive<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:15.799> because<00:04:16.799> we<00:04:16.889> don't<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.130> a

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
wheel drive so because we don't have a

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.969 
wheel drive so because we don't have a
differential<00:04:17.760> or<00:04:17.880> anything<00:04:18.109> I'm<00:04:19.109> gonna<00:04:19.229> rig

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
differential or anything I'm gonna rig

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.610 
differential or anything I'm gonna rig
the<00:04:20.190> muffler<00:04:20.549> onto<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.880> exhaust<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.500> have

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the muffler onto the exhaust and we have

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.460 
the muffler onto the exhaust and we have
motorcycle<00:04:23.190> Springs<00:04:23.490> right<00:04:23.729> here<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:25.139> here

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
motorcycle Springs right here in here

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.860 
motorcycle Springs right here in here
and<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.979> entire<00:04:26.460> engine<00:04:26.970> platform<00:04:28.130> pivots<00:04:29.870> on

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
and the entire engine platform pivots on

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.210 
and the entire engine platform pivots on
two<00:04:31.139> bolts<00:04:31.620> right<00:04:32.990> there<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:35.669> right<00:04:36.270> there

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
two bolts right there and right there

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.129 
two bolts right there and right there
so<00:04:38.220> in<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> entire<00:04:39.000> engine<00:04:39.330> platform<00:04:39.540> pivots

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
so in the entire engine platform pivots

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.890 
so in the entire engine platform pivots
up<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.440> down<00:04:40.850> but<00:04:41.850> it's<00:04:42.030> held<00:04:42.270> by<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.479> springs

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
up and down but it's held by the springs

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.940 
up and down but it's held by the springs
and<00:04:43.380> then<00:04:43.530> those<00:04:43.680> bolts<00:04:44.130> just<00:04:45.710> keep<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
and then those bolts just keep the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.180 
and then those bolts just keep the
platform<00:04:47.990> moving<00:04:48.990> up<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.289> down<00:04:49.500> not<00:04:49.740> side<00:04:50.010> to

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
platform moving up and down not side to

00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:00.469 
platform moving up and down not side to
side<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.630> then<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.990> front<00:04:52.760> we<00:04:53.760> have<00:04:58.970> Lord<00:04:59.970> see

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
side and then the front we have Lord see

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.570 
side and then the front we have Lord see
there<00:05:00.770> we<00:05:01.770> have<00:05:02.810> Springs<00:05:03.810> from<00:05:04.650> engine<00:05:05.220> valves

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
there we have Springs from engine valves

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.510 
there we have Springs from engine valves
you<00:05:05.729> just<00:05:05.910> buy<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.330> like<00:05:06.510> it<00:05:06.690> any<00:05:07.220> car<00:05:08.220> parts

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
you just buy on it like it any car parts

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.900 
you just buy on it like it any car parts
store<00:05:08.820> but<00:05:09.539> are<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:10.050> they're<00:05:10.860> just<00:05:11.039> they<00:05:11.610> are

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
store but are and they're just they are

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.670 
store but are and they're just they are
in<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.150> engine<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.930> keep<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.350> valves

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
in the engine to keep the valves

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.460 
in the engine to keep the valves
depressed<00:05:14.100> but<00:05:14.660> in<00:05:15.660> this<00:05:15.780> case<00:05:16.080> we're<00:05:16.440> using

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
depressed but in this case we're using

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.409 
depressed but in this case we're using
it<00:05:16.890> as<00:05:17.070> suspension<00:05:17.580> because<00:05:17.940> they're<00:05:18.090> quite

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
it as suspension because they're quite

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.430 
it as suspension because they're quite
stiff<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:20.280> means<00:05:20.520> three<00:05:20.820> so<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.360> axle<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
stiff it means three so that axle the

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.490 
stiff it means three so that axle the
wood<00:05:22.919> axle<00:05:23.310> can<00:05:23.490> move<00:05:23.669> straight<00:05:23.880> up<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.240> down

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
wood axle can move straight up and down

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.499 
wood axle can move straight up and down
or<00:05:25.500> tilt<00:05:25.919> side<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.400> side<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.060> then

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.110 

and<00:05:32.509> then<00:05:33.199> Neil's<00:05:33.949> our<00:05:34.220> dolly<00:05:34.460> wheels<00:05:34.759> that<00:05:35.060> we

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
and then Neil's our dolly wheels that we

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.480 
and then Neil's our dolly wheels that we
got<00:05:35.270> Harbor<00:05:35.629> Freight<00:05:35.889> I'd<00:05:36.889> definitely<00:05:37.310> not

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
got Harbor Freight I'd definitely not

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.339 
got Harbor Freight I'd definitely not
recommend<00:05:38.030> those<00:05:38.210> especially<00:05:38.810> for<00:05:39.199> any

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
recommend those especially for any

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:46.480 
recommend those especially for any
driven<00:05:39.860> wheels<00:05:40.039> because<00:05:40.580> they<00:05:41.050> broke

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.279 

so<00:05:46.819> this<00:05:47.120> is<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.449> wheel<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:47.870> I<00:05:47.930> have<00:05:48.169> our

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
so this is the wheel that I have our

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.930 
so this is the wheel that I have our
parent<00:05:48.650> it's<00:05:48.740> black<00:05:48.979> spray<00:05:49.220> paint<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.639> look

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
parent it's black spray paint that look

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.659 
parent it's black spray paint that look
just<00:05:50.270> like<00:05:50.389> those<00:05:50.630> other<00:05:50.979> ones<00:05:51.979> you<00:05:52.460> saw

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
just like those other ones you saw

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.839 
just like those other ones you saw
outside<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.330> my<00:05:53.840> neighbor<00:05:54.050> reinforced<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:54.889> by

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
outside and my neighbor reinforced it by

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.990 
outside and my neighbor reinforced it by
adding<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.330> 3/16<00:05:57.199> steel<00:05:57.680> plate<00:05:57.979> between<00:05:58.610> the

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
adding a 3/16 steel plate between the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.040 
adding a 3/16 steel plate between the
two<00:05:59.150> rims

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.899 

so<00:06:07.050> just<00:06:07.229> under<00:06:07.500> this<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.919> then<00:06:08.159> welded<00:06:08.789> the

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
so just under this and then welded the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.399 
so just under this and then welded the
bearing<00:06:09.620> sleeve<00:06:10.620> assembly<00:06:11.460> thing<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:13.169> the

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
bearing sleeve assembly thing to the

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.080 
bearing sleeve assembly thing to the
steel<00:06:13.949> and<00:06:14.509> then<00:06:15.509> also<00:06:15.689> to<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.819> wheel<00:06:17.819> you

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
steel and then also to the wheel you

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.309 
steel and then also to the wheel you
can't<00:06:18.300> quite<00:06:18.479> see<00:06:18.539> it<00:06:18.750> because<00:06:19.050> I<00:06:19.080> had<00:06:19.229> the

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
can't quite see it because I had the

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:25.100 
can't quite see it because I had the
pulley<00:06:19.530> in<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.740> way<00:06:20.900> but<00:06:21.900> yeah<00:06:22.139> and<00:06:22.530> then<00:06:24.110> axle

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
pulley in the way but yeah and then axle

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.360 
pulley in the way but yeah and then axle
goes<00:06:25.199> through<00:06:25.439> there<00:06:25.650> and<00:06:25.860> then<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.129> pulley

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
goes through there and then the pulley

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.390 
goes through there and then the pulley
is<00:06:27.180> independent<00:06:28.139> of<00:06:28.259> the<00:06:28.530> support<00:06:29.159> axle<00:06:30.110> so

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
is independent of the support axle so

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.369 
is independent of the support axle so
the<00:06:32.400> actual<00:06:32.789> number<00:06:32.819> turns<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.719> jack<00:06:33.990> shaft

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
the actual number turns the jack shaft

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.699 
the actual number turns the jack shaft
does<00:06:35.150> loop<00:06:36.150> in<00:06:36.360> one<00:06:36.599> wheel<00:06:36.810> does<00:06:37.550> so<00:06:38.550> yeah
