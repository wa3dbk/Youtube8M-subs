because<00:02:34.489> they<00:02:34.730> are<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:36.500> multiple<00:02:36.950> brands<00:02:40.060> what

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
because they are in multiple brands what

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.580 
because they are in multiple brands what
I<00:02:41.090> read<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.660> really<00:02:41.930> what<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.140> should<00:02:42.170> do

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
I read is that really what you should do

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
I read is that really what you should do
is<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:42.980> should<00:02:43.010> freeze<00:02:43.730> your<00:02:44.090> flower<00:02:45.610> freeze

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
is you should freeze your flower freeze

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.740 
is you should freeze your flower freeze
the<00:02:46.879> flower<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:49.370> will<00:02:49.579> kill<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.150> larvae

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the flower that will kill the larvae

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.140 
the flower that will kill the larvae
which<00:02:51.110> inevitably<00:02:51.650> get<00:02:51.890> into<00:02:52.190> most<00:02:52.400> brands

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
which inevitably get into most brands

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.250 
which inevitably get into most brands
and<00:02:53.420> then<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.739> larvae<00:02:55.250> will<00:02:55.459> never<00:02:55.810> grow<00:02:56.810> into

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
and then the larvae will never grow into

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.680 
and then the larvae will never grow into
full-blown<00:02:58.900> bugs<00:03:00.849> but<00:03:01.849> there<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.209> it

so<00:03:27.940> perhaps<00:03:28.940> good<00:03:29.480> advice<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.139> read<00:03:30.290> on

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
so perhaps good advice that I read on

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.170 
so perhaps good advice that I read on
the<00:03:30.500> internet<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.040> first<00:03:31.220> freeze<00:03:31.880> your

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
then you could avoid well the title of

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.049 
then you could avoid well the title of
my<00:03:39.049> video<00:03:39.310> bugs<00:03:40.419> in<00:03:41.419> your<00:03:41.690> flower
