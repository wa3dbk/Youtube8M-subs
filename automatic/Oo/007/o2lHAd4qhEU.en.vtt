00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.990
 on a safari in had the photographer 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.420
 michael denny squad managed to collect 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.210
 some images that have gone around the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.969
 world and that the truth surprised all 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.190
 the people who look like you know 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.740
 cheetahs are animals that are 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.500
 they dedicate to hunt in order to survive 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.230
 they are carnivores and are considered 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.900
 also the fastest animals in the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.480
 world terrestrial animals more 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 fast reaching speeds of more than 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.139
 100 kilometers per hour 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.249
 comparable to the speeds of a 

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:39.949
 car on a highway notwithstanding what 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:42.350
 what are you going to see next is going to 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.360
 see a series of cheetahs that are 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.210
 Playing 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.210
 with their food that is to say they are not 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.560
 eating and best of all is that the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.050
 dam 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.780
 it seems that he does not care about the presence of 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.690
 these browns can actually see in a 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.540
 picture how you feel good as you lay 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.720
 with complete peace of mind in front of the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.720
 Cheetahs 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.630
 simply awesome and very 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.140
 difficult to explain because it is very rare 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.479
 find this kind of situations in the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.850
 wild nature even situations 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.119
 in which we see that those of the three 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.880
 degrees that are here come to join the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.710
 side of this animal already lick the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 neck as if they were his to me as if 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.820
 were his friends not 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.250
 it is so strange that it seems 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.159
 it seems like a montage but actually 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.960
 it's not a montage because you know 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.090
 It is known that it is real because these photos 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.729
 they were taken by a very photographer 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.729
 famous called michael dennis what 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.350
 the truth is that it is curious that 3 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.320
 cheetahs get to play with a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.000
 Impala and treat him like he was one 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.100
 more of the family this kind of 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.280
 situations do not usually occur in a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 normal since it is true that the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.509
 cheetahs sometimes play with their prey 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.899
 but this has not happened in cheetahs 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.830
 adults not at the level seen in the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.830
 following images
