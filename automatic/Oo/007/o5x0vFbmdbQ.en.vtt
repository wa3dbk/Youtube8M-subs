obviously<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:53.880> easy<00:00:54.270> progression

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
obviously it's a very easy progression

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170 
obviously it's a very easy progression
to<00:00:55.260> learn<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:56.130> is<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.580> something<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.060> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to learn this is just something that I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.570 
to learn this is just something that I
heard<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.510> TV<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.740> the<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> melody<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
heard on TV and I like the the melody of

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.950 
heard on TV and I like the the melody of
it<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.960> put<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.100> keyboard<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.150> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it so I put a little keyboard so the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.670 
it so I put a little keyboard so the
first<00:01:04.290> chord<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:05.100> gonna<00:01:05.370> be<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.670> minor<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
first chord is gonna be a minor it's a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
first chord is gonna be a minor it's a
basic<00:01:08.070> chord<00:01:08.550> progression<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.120> not<00:01:09.240> too

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
basic chord progression it's not too

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.340 
basic chord progression it's not too
difficult<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:10.020> all

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
difficult at all

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
difficult at all
it<00:01:10.470> doesn't<00:01:10.800> change<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.120> at<00:01:12.300> any<00:01:12.330> part<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it doesn't change at all at any part of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.150 
it doesn't change at all at any part of
this<00:01:12.840> long<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.120> play<00:01:15.479> along<00:01:15.660> with<00:01:15.870> it

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
this long so if you play along with it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.390 
this long so if you play along with it
but<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.700> important<00:01:18.210> important<00:01:18.810> part<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
but the important important part is

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.359 
but the important important part is
first<00:01:20.400> board<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.910> gonna<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> minor<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.009> eg<00:01:23.009> B

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
first board is gonna be a minor for eg B

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.240 
first board is gonna be a minor for eg B
D<00:01:23.820> G<00:01:23.850> B<00:01:25.190> so<00:01:26.190> I'm<00:01:26.250> gonna<00:01:26.340> play<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.640> chord<00:01:26.880> first

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250
