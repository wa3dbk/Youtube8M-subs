00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello and welcome to this new video 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.139
 tutorial 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.879
 in this situation I will be 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.590
 teaching how to repair sunglasses that 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.760
 for some situation or another have already 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.460
 been broken 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.020
 for this they are going to need a couple of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.770
 sunglasses preferably mind 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.710
 preferably preferably broken or 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.480
 they can break me in my case and the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 I had prepared once inadvertently 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 the pixels are going to need tape 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.190
 paper and a marker color of their 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.059
 lenses in my case are black as the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.579
 marker but they might be green 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.980
 or even oranges 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.460
 That really depends on each person 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.280
 An important notice if you are under 18 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 years are very likely not to have 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.930
 permission to use the paper tape and if 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 that is your case I recommend you ask 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.610
 help from a responsible person and leave 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.820
 to see this video 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.850
 good now that only people are 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.759
 I will teach you over 18 years old 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.970
 first they will take their sunglasses and 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 open them in this way to facilitate the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.340
 the way of work are going to cut a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.610
 piece of paper tape like that and we 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:47.010
 they will stick with the adhesive part towards 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.010
 the telescope in this way 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 it looks good they are going to repeat the process 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:05.120
 they approach it further away from the point where 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.420
 they started to fix 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.050
 come I decided to start from the middle and 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.480
 move away towards 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.990
 the both sides and then we're going to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.740
 get to the point where we cover all the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.820
 break like this 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.730
 good if what they were looking for I will finish 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.940
 to solve that problem there 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.909
 if what they were looking for was another solution 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.090
 detailed or say if what they were looking for was 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:43.150
 a faster solution this can 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.790
 work if what they were looking for was a 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.799
 to get out of the way but 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.349
 if they are working with and what time 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.230
 seek is a more detailed solution what 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.879
 what they are going to do is close the lenses of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.150
 sun in this way again for 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.359
 facilitate the work will uncover the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.730
 marker or highlighter in my case was the 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.140
 black marker 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.400
 very carefully 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.280
 they will color or paint 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:18.790
 within what they have just 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.280
 cover in this way and you can always go 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.300
 down 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.300
 in circles 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.599
 Or simply 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.599
 in a rather spontaneous way 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.440
 deregulated 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.710
 once we have 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.010
 our colored lens in this 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.140
 case I do it fast but I think it 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.750
 understand the concept once we have 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.810
 the sun lens and colored we can 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.040
 and go unnoticed in this way in 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.840
 the one that in the distance does not notice that 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.840
 it was or is broken 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.080
