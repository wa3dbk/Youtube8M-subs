00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
because as you can see if I can as I get

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.830 
because as you can see if I can as I get
it<00:00:32.930> closer<00:00:33.700> a<00:00:35.050> lot<00:00:36.050> of<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:36.800> foil<00:00:37.510> but<00:00:38.510> once

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
it closer a lot of this is foil but once

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.300 
it closer a lot of this is foil but once
you<00:00:38.930> get<00:00:39.080> far<00:00:39.320> away<00:00:39.470> it<00:00:39.710> kind<00:00:39.920> of

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
you get far away it kind of

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.150 
you get far away it kind of
isn't<00:00:42.060> quite<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.690> clear<00:00:43.140> which<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> was

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
isn't quite as clear which is what I was

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.070 
isn't quite as clear which is what I was
going<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.780> but<00:00:45.780> basically<00:00:47.690> that's<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.930> these

video so add a little bit of brown and
red<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.600> where<00:01:39.229> your<00:01:39.410> knuckles<00:01:39.830> are<00:01:40.460> going<00:01:40.729> to

you<00:01:44.320> have<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:44.590> be<00:01:44.679> really<00:01:45.100> careful<00:01:45.340> with

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you have to be really careful with

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.609 
you have to be really careful with
painting<00:01:45.999> the<00:01:46.090> bottoms<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.659> these<00:01:46.869> because

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
painting the bottoms of these because

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.929 
painting the bottoms of these because
with<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.950> top<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.369> can<00:01:48.429> just<00:01:48.670> kind<00:01:48.880> of

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
with the top so you can just kind of

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.529 
with the top so you can just kind of
extend<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:50.140> cuticle<00:01:50.819> but<00:01:51.819> with<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.329> bottom

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
extend the cuticle but with the bottom

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.880 
extend the cuticle but with the bottom
you<00:01:52.899> know<00:01:52.929> you<00:01:53.079> have<00:01:53.319> to<00:01:53.469> stop<00:01:53.710> at<00:01:53.859> your

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
you know you have to stop at your

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.429 
you know you have to stop at your
fingertip

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
fingertip

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.739 
fingertip
so<00:01:56.920> yeah<00:01:57.070> that's<00:01:57.490> basically<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.240> felt<00:01:58.659> like

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
so yeah that's basically it I felt like

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.569 
so yeah that's basically it I felt like
showing<00:01:59.020> these<00:01:59.259> off<00:01:59.439> in<00:01:59.619> my<00:01:59.710> first<00:01:59.979> video<00:02:00.280> on
