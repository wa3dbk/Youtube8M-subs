anybody you don't really want to be
changing<00:00:18.269> you<00:00:18.330> game<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.840> way<00:00:19.019> or<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> other

changing you game one way or the other
front<00:00:20.759> or<00:00:20.849> behind<00:00:20.939> there<00:00:21.689> are<00:00:21.810> times<00:00:22.109> when<00:00:22.380> you

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
front or behind there are times when you

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.499 
front or behind there are times when you
might<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.220> decide<00:00:23.669> that<00:00:23.909> you've<00:00:24.300> got

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
might really decide that you've got

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.229 
might really decide that you've got
nothing<00:00:24.659> to<00:00:24.839> lose<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.890> push<00:00:26.339> it<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:26.640> forward

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
nothing to lose and push it all forward

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.479 
nothing to lose and push it all forward
but<00:00:27.499> generally<00:00:28.499> I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.589> Judds<00:00:29.159> got<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.339> good

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
but generally I think Judds got a good

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.460 
but generally I think Judds got a good
balance<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.970> his<00:00:30.060> game<00:00:30.349> picking<00:00:31.349> on

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
balance to his game picking on

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.170 
balance to his game picking on
individual<00:00:31.980> shots<00:00:32.220> everybody's<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.090> have

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
individual shots everybody's gonna have

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.610 
individual shots everybody's gonna have
their<00:00:33.300> own<00:00:33.390> style<00:00:33.720> but<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.290> general

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
their own style but your general

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.800 
their own style but your general
standard<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.250> play<00:00:35.489> remains<00:00:36.060> pretty<00:00:36.270> constant

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
standard of play remains pretty constant

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.690 
standard of play remains pretty constant
from<00:00:37.170> Stuart's<00:00:37.560> perspective<00:00:38.070> how<00:00:38.250> should<00:00:38.550> he

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
from Stuart's perspective how should he

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430 
from Stuart's perspective how should he
reflect<00:00:39.150> on<00:00:39.330> that<00:00:39.450> performance<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.140> it'd

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
reflect on that performance I think it'd

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.050 
reflect on that performance I think it'd
be<00:00:40.470> very<00:00:40.530> disappointed<00:00:41.220> that<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.490> mean<00:00:41.670> even<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
be very disappointed that I mean even it

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.510 
be very disappointed that I mean even it
had<00:00:42.330> a<00:00:42.360> good<00:00:42.570> chance<00:00:42.810> in<00:00:42.990> that<00:00:43.110> last<00:00:43.290> frame<00:00:43.620> the

me a tricky read and I went for that
went<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:53.970> felt<00:03:54.440> towards<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.470> end<00:03:55.590> of

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
went in and I felt towards the end of

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.900 
went in and I felt towards the end of
the<00:03:55.709> frame<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.860> just<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.370> didn't<00:03:56.640> think<00:03:56.730> he<00:03:56.850> was

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
the frame I just I didn't think he was

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.759 
the frame I just I didn't think he was
gonna<00:03:57.000> poly<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.330> looked<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.350> little<00:03:58.470> bit<00:03:58.620> nervous

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
gonna poly I looked a little bit nervous

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.150 
gonna poly I looked a little bit nervous
to<00:03:59.070> me<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.630> luckily<00:04:00.630> for<00:04:00.900> me<00:04:01.049> he<00:04:01.260> had<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.440> kick

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
to me and luckily for me he had a kick

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.440 
to me and luckily for me he had a kick
in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.340> last<00:04:02.580> frame<00:04:02.790> which<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> bit<00:04:03.269> unlucky

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
in the last frame which is a bit unlucky

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.090 
in the last frame which is a bit unlucky
but<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.840> think<00:04:04.170> he<00:04:04.290> did<00:04:04.470> have<00:04:04.590> his<00:04:04.620> chances<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
but I think he did have his chances to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.560 
but I think he did have his chances to
win<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.370> we're<00:04:05.910> looking<00:04:05.970> forward<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.360> seeing
