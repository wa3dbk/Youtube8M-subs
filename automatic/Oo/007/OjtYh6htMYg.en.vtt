00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
okay these are uh this is a brake

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.000 
okay these are uh this is a brake
caliper<00:00:16.370> new<00:00:16.789> I<00:00:17.000> rebuilt<00:00:17.480> one<00:00:17.680> then<00:00:18.680> I'm<00:00:18.770> going

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
caliper new I rebuilt one then I'm going

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.590 
caliper new I rebuilt one then I'm going
to<00:00:19.100> install<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:19.790> if<00:00:19.850> you'll<00:00:20.000> notice<00:00:20.330> there's

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
to install and if you'll notice there's

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.650 
to install and if you'll notice there's
a<00:00:20.660> little<00:00:20.930> rubber<00:00:21.910> isolator<00:00:22.910> this<00:00:23.270> is<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:23.540> one

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
a little rubber isolator this is the one

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.860 
a little rubber isolator this is the one
on<00:00:23.780> the<00:00:23.900> other<00:00:23.960> side<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:24.680> belonged<00:00:25.550> here

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
on the other side that belonged here

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.500 
on the other side that belonged here
yeah<00:00:26.870> I<00:00:26.900> just<00:00:27.050> made<00:00:27.260> a<00:00:27.290> rubber<00:00:27.560> can<00:00:28.040> be<00:00:28.130> bent

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
yeah I just made a rubber can be bent

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.480 
yeah I just made a rubber can be bent
well<00:00:29.510> what<00:00:30.140> that<00:00:30.320> does<00:00:30.590> is<00:00:30.800> it<00:00:30.950> causes<00:00:31.160> the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
well what that does is it causes the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.700 
well what that does is it causes the
pads<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:32.000> when<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.780> pads<00:00:32.989> are<00:00:33.170> resting<00:00:33.469> here

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
pads to when the pads are resting here

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.329 
pads to when the pads are resting here
did<00:00:34.640> not<00:00:34.670> go<00:00:34.910> flat<00:00:35.210> against<00:00:35.749> the<00:00:35.839> piston<00:00:36.339> it's

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
did not go flat against the piston it's

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.119 
did not go flat against the piston it's
good<00:00:37.550> for<00:00:37.730> noise<00:00:37.879> isolation<00:00:38.480> but<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.769> problem

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
good for noise isolation but the problem

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.720 
good for noise isolation but the problem
is<00:00:40.249> it<00:00:40.570> isn't<00:00:41.570> good<00:00:41.839> for<00:00:42.249> precise<00:00:43.249> braking

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
is it isn't good for precise braking

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.279 
is it isn't good for precise braking
these<00:00:44.329> are<00:00:44.539> what<00:00:44.629> they<00:00:44.719> call<00:00:44.749> maximum

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
these are what they call maximum

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.090 
these are what they call maximum
motorsport<00:00:47.350> stainless<00:00:48.350> steel<00:00:48.589> bushings

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
motorsport stainless steel bushings

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.459 
motorsport stainless steel bushings
they're<00:00:49.309> made<00:00:49.609> of<00:00:49.760> hard<00:00:50.149> metal<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.719> these<00:00:51.319> are

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
they're made of hard metal and these are

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.809 
they're made of hard metal and these are
going<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.620> be<00:00:51.710> used<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.010> replace<00:00:53.319> these<00:00:54.819> rubber

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be used to replace these rubber

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:59.139 
going to be used to replace these rubber
ones<00:00:56.059> when<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.719> one<00:00:57.019> step<00:00:57.319> here<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:58.999> can

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
ones when you one step here so you can

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.759 
ones when you one step here so you can
see<00:00:59.300> that<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:01.219> is<00:01:01.699> gonna<00:01:01.999> replace<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.769> but

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
see that this is gonna replace that but

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.049 
see that this is gonna replace that but
instead<00:01:03.889> of<00:01:04.070> rubber<00:01:04.370> it's<00:01:04.580> just<00:01:04.760> gonna<00:01:04.850> be

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
instead of rubber it's just gonna be

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.440 
instead of rubber it's just gonna be
hard<00:01:05.390> metal<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.920> metal<00:01:07.159> will<00:01:07.579> be<00:01:07.820> more

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
hard metal and so the metal will be more

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:18.399 
hard metal and so the metal will be more
accurate

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.620 

it's<00:01:19.409> already<00:01:19.679> on<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.009> side<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.670> just

sure mess up the surface that's it
you<00:01:39.929> can<00:01:40.109> see<00:01:40.289> here<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.569> is<00:01:42.719> now<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:43.819> metal

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
you can see here that it is now a metal

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.800 
you can see here that it is now a metal

stainless<00:01:57.899> steel<00:01:58.259> braided<00:01:58.590> brake<00:01:59.250> lines<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
stainless steel braided brake lines I

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.229 
stainless steel braided brake lines I
got<00:02:00.750> these<00:02:00.869> from<00:02:01.280> 500<00:02:02.280> resto<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.090> can

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
got these from 500 resto I think you can

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.449 
got these from 500 resto I think you can
also<00:02:03.359> get<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.599> from<00:02:03.629> EXO<00:02:03.959> motorsports<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
also get them from EXO motorsports it

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.339 
also get them from EXO motorsports it
says<00:02:05.700> stop<00:02:06.000> tech<00:02:06.239> on<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.539> but<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.140> is

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
says stop tech on it but I think this is

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.789 
says stop tech on it but I think this is
what<00:02:07.890> motor<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.399> business<00:02:08.700> hub<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.799> they

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
what motor for business hub like they

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.970 
what motor for business hub like they
see<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> label<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
see the label what you get is a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.740 
see the label what you get is a
stainless<00:02:14.549> steel<00:02:14.760> braided<00:02:15.000> line<00:02:15.359> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
stainless steel braided line and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.849 
stainless steel braided line and
essentially<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> slight<00:02:19.079> different<00:02:19.470> fitting

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
essentially a slight different fitting

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.620 
essentially a slight different fitting
you<00:02:20.579> have<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> mounting<00:02:21.120> bolt<00:02:21.329> now<00:02:21.420> here's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
you have a mounting bolt now here's

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.280 
you have a mounting bolt now here's
what's<00:02:21.810> interesting

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
what's interesting

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.599 
what's interesting
here's<00:02:22.500> all<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.799> bits<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.040> pieces<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.489> go

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
here's all the bits and pieces that go

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.379 
here's all the bits and pieces that go
with<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.959> new<00:02:25.079> fluid<00:02:25.349> bolt<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.130> camps<00:02:26.549> but

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
with it the new fluid bolt the camps but

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.520 
with it the new fluid bolt the camps but
this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:28.049> different

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
this is different

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.479 
this is different
because<00:02:28.919> on<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:31.010> factory<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.160> you'll<00:02:32.310> see

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
because on the factory one you'll see

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.420 
because on the factory one you'll see
that<00:02:32.609> it<00:02:32.790> has<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> factory<00:02:33.630> bracket<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:35.220> need

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that it has a factory bracket and I need

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.280 
that it has a factory bracket and I need
to<00:02:35.579> actually<00:02:35.760> grind<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.419> off<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.959> drill<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
to actually grind it off so I drill a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.589 
to actually grind it off so I drill a
hole<00:02:37.530> put<00:02:37.829> this<00:02:38.010> through<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.669> mount<00:02:39.419> this

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
hole put this through it and mount this

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.330 
hole put this through it and mount this
in<00:02:39.870> place<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.319> bracket<00:02:40.739> let<00:02:40.980> me<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:41.190> get

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
in place of the bracket let me go get

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.530 
in place of the bracket let me go get
the<00:02:41.519> other<00:02:41.639> piece<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.150> that's<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.359> I'm

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the other piece and that's to I'm

00:02:42.540 --> 00:03:07.740 
the other piece and that's to I'm
talking

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.570 

this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.050> factory<00:03:09.350> bracket<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.160> factory

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
this is the factory bracket the factory

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.360 
this is the factory bracket the factory
rubber<00:03:10.850> hose<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.420> see<00:03:11.660> this<00:03:11.810> bracket<00:03:12.370> is

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
rubber hose now you see this bracket is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.170 
rubber hose now you see this bracket is
actually<00:03:15.400> attached<00:03:16.400> at<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.700> bottom<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.120> this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
actually attached at the bottom of this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.030 
actually attached at the bottom of this
rectangular<00:03:17.900> tube<00:03:18.110> is<00:03:18.260> just<00:03:18.470> essentially

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
rectangular tube is just essentially

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.910 
rectangular tube is just essentially
shot<00:03:19.310> peened<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.930> grind<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.620> off

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
shot peened so I have to grind this off

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.020 
shot peened so I have to grind this off
and<00:03:22.870> then<00:03:23.870> drill<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.560> hole<00:03:24.920> through<00:03:25.910> this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
and then drill a hole through this

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.460 
and then drill a hole through this
existing<00:03:26.780> bracket<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.340> cannot<00:03:28.640> place<00:03:28.910> this

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
existing bracket so I cannot place this

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.160 
existing bracket so I cannot place this
on<00:03:30.470> top<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.160> one<00:03:31.340> there<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:32.990> the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
on top of that one there so this is the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.500 
on top of that one there so this is the
one<00:03:33.890> on<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.070> rear<00:03:34.370> axle<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.240> center

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
one on the rear axle this is the center

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.050 
one on the rear axle this is the center
part<00:03:35.750> both<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.920> these<00:03:37.010> lines<00:03:37.280> feed<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.910> two

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
part both of these lines feed the two

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.560 
part both of these lines feed the two
drops<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.070> existing<00:03:40.880> banjo

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
drops and this is the existing banjo

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.420 
drops and this is the existing banjo
fitting<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:41.930> will<00:03:42.110> be<00:03:42.260> replaced<00:03:42.680> with<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> new

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
fitting that will be replaced with a new

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.630 
fitting that will be replaced with a new
one<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.740> factory<00:03:46.100> bracket<00:03:46.280> it's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
one this is the factory bracket it's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.280 
one this is the factory bracket it's
upside<00:03:46.940> down<00:03:46.970> here<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.450> two<00:03:47.630> brake<00:03:47.840> lines<00:03:48.080> for

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
upside down here the two brake lines for

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.950 
upside down here the two brake lines for
the<00:03:48.350> drums<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:50.000> I'm<00:03:50.120> supposed<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.480> grind<00:03:50.780> this

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
off and then drill a hole through it so

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.950 
off and then drill a hole through it so
that<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.290> can<00:03:54.500> put<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.640> new<00:03:55.960> stainless

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.860 
okay these are the stainless steel brake
lines<00:05:35.950> that<00:05:36.160> I'm<00:05:36.280> replacing<00:05:36.550> this<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.750> the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
lines that I'm replacing this is the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.210 
lines that I'm replacing this is the
original<00:05:38.130> rubber<00:05:39.130> one<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:40.420> can<00:05:40.660> see<00:05:40.870> that

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
original rubber one you can see that

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.300 
original rubber one you can see that
it's<00:05:42.220> pretty<00:05:42.490> old<00:05:42.670> for<00:05:42.730> eighteen<00:05:43.150> years<00:05:43.180> and

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
it's pretty old for eighteen years and

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.490 
it's pretty old for eighteen years and
this<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.490> actually<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.910> bracket<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.630> it

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
this is actually the bracket that it

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.790 
this is actually the bracket that it
goes<00:05:47.650> into<00:05:48.420> I'll<00:05:49.420> be<00:05:49.600> putting<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.080> like<00:05:50.860> this

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
goes into I'll be putting this like this

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.930 
goes into I'll be putting this like this
which<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.100> line<00:05:54.700> is<00:05:55.000> then<00:05:55.260> clipped<00:05:56.260> here<00:05:59.940> and

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
which the line is then clipped here and

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.530 
which the line is then clipped here and
so<00:06:01.180> this<00:06:01.360> replaces<00:06:02.670> the<00:06:03.670> rubber<00:06:03.940> line<00:06:04.210> with<00:06:04.510> a

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
so this replaces the rubber line with a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.970 
so this replaces the rubber line with a
stainless<00:06:05.260> steel<00:06:05.290> braided<00:06:05.680> one<00:06:06.210> it<00:06:07.210> allows

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
stainless steel braided one it allows

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.390 
stainless steel braided one it allows
the<00:06:08.980> braking<00:06:09.430> effort<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.330> be<00:06:10.450> much<00:06:10.660> firmer

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
the braking effort to be much firmer

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.060 
the braking effort to be much firmer
because<00:06:12.630> rubber<00:06:13.630> hose<00:06:13.900> is<00:06:14.320> not<00:06:14.350> expanding

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
because rubber hose is not expanding

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.840 
because rubber hose is not expanding
this<00:06:16.030> is<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:16.270> stop<00:06:16.630> tech<00:06:16.960> slash<00:06:17.850> maximum

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
this is a stop tech slash maximum

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.420 
this is a stop tech slash maximum
motorsports<00:06:19.420> line<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.500> I<00:06:20.530> got<00:06:20.740> from<00:06:20.890> $5.00

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
motorsports line that I got from $5.00

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.970 
motorsports line that I got from $5.00
resto<00:06:22.020> so<00:06:23.020> this<00:06:23.350> is<00:06:23.530> a<00:06:23.610> popular<00:06:24.610> pretty
