this is optional but you can also have
pliers<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.050> then<00:05:11.350> you'll<00:05:11.590> need<00:05:11.740> wire<00:05:12.040> cutters

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
pliers and then you'll need wire cutters

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.320 
pliers and then you'll need wire cutters
so<00:05:14.560> first<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.950> just<00:05:15.160> rolled<00:05:15.370> out<00:05:15.520> some<00:05:15.760> wire<00:05:15.970> and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
so first I just rolled out some wire and

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.000 
so first I just rolled out some wire and
you<00:05:16.360> can<00:05:16.540> get<00:05:16.660> as<00:05:16.750> much<00:05:16.900> as<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.200> want<00:05:17.470> for<00:05:17.770> how

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
you can get as much as you want for how

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.920 
you can get as much as you want for how
many<00:05:18.070> coils<00:05:18.520> want<00:05:19.000> your<00:05:19.150> ring<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.450> have<00:05:19.630> and

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
many coils want your ring to have and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.840 
many coils want your ring to have and
then<00:05:20.380> I'm<00:05:20.500> just<00:05:20.680> snipping<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.220> with<00:05:21.430> my<00:05:21.610> wire

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
then I'm just snipping it with my wire

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.360 
then I'm just snipping it with my wire
cutters<00:05:22.330> then<00:05:23.230> starting<00:05:23.680> at<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.800> base<00:05:24.040> of<00:05:24.070> my

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
cutters then starting at the base of my

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.820 
cutters then starting at the base of my
finger<00:05:24.820> I'm<00:05:25.060> just<00:05:25.360> coiling<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.080> around<00:05:26.470> my

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
finger I'm just coiling it around my

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.490 
finger I'm just coiling it around my
finger<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.610> yes<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.510> doesn't<00:05:28.780> have<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.930> be<00:05:29.020> too

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
finger and yes it doesn't have to be too

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.530 
finger and yes it doesn't have to be too
precise<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.400> first<00:05:30.640> time<00:05:30.910> because<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.390> can

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
precise the first time because you can

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.540 
precise the first time because you can
always<00:05:31.780> adjust<00:05:34.590> then<00:05:35.590> once<00:05:35.800> i'm<00:05:35.950> done<00:05:35.980> i<00:05:36.340> just

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
always adjust then once i'm done i just

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.160 
always adjust then once i'm done i just
popped<00:05:36.790> it<00:05:37.000> off<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.420> now<00:05:37.600> i'm<00:05:37.900> making

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
popped it off and now i'm making

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.140 
popped it off and now i'm making
adjustments<00:05:38.290> because<00:05:38.890> mine<00:05:39.280> was<00:05:39.310> quite<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:39.970> bit

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
adjustments because mine was quite a bit

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.520 
adjustments because mine was quite a bit
too<00:05:40.270> tight<00:05:40.300> so<00:05:40.540> I'm<00:05:40.870> just<00:05:41.050> stretching<00:05:41.200> it<00:05:41.440> out

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
too tight so I'm just stretching it out

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.710 
too tight so I'm just stretching it out
to<00:05:42.010> fit<00:05:42.190> me<00:05:42.370> best<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:46.090> one<00:05:46.240> I<00:05:46.270> just<00:05:46.510> made

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
to fit me best and the one I just made

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.270 
to fit me best and the one I just made
had<00:05:47.020> three<00:05:47.290> loops<00:05:47.530> but<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.830> can<00:05:47.980> make<00:05:48.070> them

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
had three loops but you can make them

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310 
had three loops but you can make them
have<00:05:48.460> as<00:05:48.700> many<00:05:48.910> loops<00:05:49.270> as<00:05:49.450> he's<00:05:49.630> like<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.170> they

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
have as many loops as he's like and they

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.100 
have as many loops as he's like and they
will<00:05:50.500> look<00:05:50.650> adorable<00:05:50.890> either<00:05:51.520> way
