00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.109
 finish 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 as for the market and novation 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.399
 with the conassif percent and with the rural association of Paraguay 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.160
 he was written in order to 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.920
 make an innovative service an innovative and fivefold service 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.820
 that we want 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 will offer within the country something that was a felt need 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.650
 the felt need that does exist at the regional level 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.730
 that the biological entity of sheep 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 it can also be equine that other species 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.990
 this project has considered innovative 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.760
 polke in the country where the biological identity study was not carried out 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.880
 in nothing good 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.680
 humans who animals 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.900
 as a consequence a technology that is 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 Unfortunately I am very backward to the country but it did exist in the region 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 so basically the innovation is that in a service 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.750
 but benítez and argentina 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.610
 what the law 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.140
 rp needed the rural region of Paraguay víctor the creators 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.360
 they definitely needed to increase the country 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940
 but with respect to the opening of the market 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.649
 in the countries of the region and especially the country is developed in 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.830
 U.S 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.020
 Europe 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 the theme of technology fill in the traceability is transforming into a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.480
 requirement 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.550
 worldwide growing 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.530
 with respect to the traceability of beef at the livestock level 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.080
 that is being exported outside of the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.710
 will come a time when countries are going to have to certify 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.019
 also because the fingerprint we are going to tell by the technology of the bn 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.269
 that the meat sample that led to an opa 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.900
 in the lots that are left correspond to your biological 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:23.899
 ec that 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.170
 has some traceability thing that were 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.989
 of a breakthrough 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.209
 building writers wanted to homologate determined that then doors to the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.320
 slaughterhouse in such a site and then it was exported 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320
 at such a moment 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.649
 the positive of this project 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:47.539
 in to respect what is the union company in this particular case the 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.859
 Paraguayan rural population with the university that is the institute of 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.129
 health science research 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.319
 it is a very interesting force what is being promoted lately in 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.249
 all the countries of the world 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.369
 especially the monarchy has a very big gain 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.969
 us as a department that always 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.299
 17 years old we had done research 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.649
 we have only devoted ourselves to research 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:16.669
 We are going to be able to offer a service that lowers income to the institution 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.839
 this gain that will enter sources 30 will allow them to be 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.709
 develop mardones actions 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.239
 grow and has been presented for the people of limited resources that is our 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.719
 put it that purpose as diagnostic 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.719
 next to the other areas of the institution 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.189
 we are ready to lisandro the Nazi circus 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.739
 tecate - really 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.709
 in the last two or three years 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.879
 a support force that gives us as researchers of the 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.019
 the Celtic national level 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.209
 a support in the financial area 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.799
 what in many times it was not difficult to be competitive on the outside that was 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.619
 where we could get points 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:03.569
 but yes 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.489
 allows us 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.290
 the cross does not give more security than the country itself 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.319
 invest in technological development 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.839
 at the moment they have known have starred this support% the financial 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.669
 to development and research 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.259
 innovation research 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.919
 eric onassis does not lure you not only that tool that many times in the 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.909
 silver but that also allows us 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.240
 perform comprehensive work 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.129
 and jobs that are not percent 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.749
 I told them about the wake of other countries and they are not our country's own needs 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.170
 the neighboring countries without going any further 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.600
 of the region invest miñones 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.949
 of dollars 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.490
 it is said that rich countries are rich because they do research and it is not that 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.990
 they do research 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.249
 because they are rich, there is a very high concept 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.069
 I wish the investigation 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.319
 many people 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.280
 think 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.990
 despite being research 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.749
 it's a silver expense 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.080
 and that is like a luxury of the country 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.330
 Unlike 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.699
 all the groups that can develop 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.129
 investigation 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.249
 in the countries that is reversed as at this moment 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.049
 is being reversed for an activity there is a need is a project of 

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:25.150
 innovation 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
 10 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.129
 finish 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.189
