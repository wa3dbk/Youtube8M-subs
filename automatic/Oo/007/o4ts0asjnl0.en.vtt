and<00:00:29.189> annoyed<00:00:29.460> me<00:00:29.640> most<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.199> fact

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and annoyed me most of all was the fact

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990 
and annoyed me most of all was the fact
that<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.830> attempted<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> hide<00:00:32.579> during<00:00:32.850> the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
regarding this character to be honest
plus<00:01:29.610> I'd<00:01:29.759> imagine<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:30.479> reason<00:01:30.810> he's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
plus I'd imagine the only reason he's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.620 
plus I'd imagine the only reason he's
currently<00:01:31.380> seen<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.549> scale<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.329> rest<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
currently seen in scale with the rest of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
currently seen in scale with the rest of
the<00:01:33.720> mutants<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.829> movie<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.159> only

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the mutants is because the movie is only

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
the mutants is because the movie is only
five<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> six<00:01:36.000> weeks<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.659> filming<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
five to six weeks into filming so of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520 
five to six weeks into filming so of
course<00:01:38.400> no<00:01:38.670> special<00:01:39.119> effects<00:01:39.479> or<00:01:39.780> CGI<00:01:40.290> has

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
course no special effects or CGI has

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960 
course no special effects or CGI has
been<00:01:40.680> applied<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.369> there's<00:01:41.579> no<00:01:41.700> way<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> can

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
been applied so there's no way I can

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
been applied so there's no way I can
really<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.450> harsh<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.110> character<00:01:43.439> or

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
really be harsh on this character or

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.370 
really be harsh on this character or
really<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> trailer<00:01:45.090> its<00:01:45.659> overall<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really on the trailer its overall just a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
really on the trailer its overall just a
pacifier<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> public<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.700> gives<00:01:48.000> us

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
pacifier to the public which gives us

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
pacifier to the public which gives us
something<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> movie<00:01:49.350> we've<00:01:49.500> been

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
something from the movie we've been

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.069 
something from the movie we've been
really<00:01:50.040> looking<00:01:50.280> forward<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.049> but<00:01:52.049> I

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
really looking forward to but I

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.359 
really looking forward to but I
definitely<00:01:52.140> can't<00:01:52.649> wait<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
apocalypse which I'd assume will be

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
apocalypse which I'd assume will be

really enjoyed the sequence in the last

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.330 
really enjoyed the sequence in the last
film<00:04:15.290> where<00:04:15.470> he<00:04:15.590> would<00:04:15.739> move<00:04:15.860> bullets<00:04:16.250> in

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
film where he would move bullets in

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.550

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
that but I highly doubt anything could

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.200 
that but I highly doubt anything could
top<00:04:21.770> that<00:04:21.950> scene<00:04:22.340> which<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.669> found<00:04:22.789> to<00:04:22.910> be<00:04:23.030> just
