00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.200 

in<00:01:08.250> film<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> drop<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:14.210> but

fast I'm actually going to wash my hair
with<00:01:18.170> clarifying<00:01:20.479> shampoo<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.439> says

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
with clarifying shampoo because it says

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:37.730 
with clarifying shampoo because it says
it<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.369> write<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> deed<00:01:23.850> color<00:01:35.750> yeah<00:01:36.750> okay

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so I'm just like washed and dried I

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.020 
so I'm just like washed and dried I
think<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> could<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> better<00:01:41.850> light

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
think you could see in a better light

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
think you could see in a better light
look<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:43.409> doesn't<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.740> ginger<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.549> it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
look it doesn't look ginger but it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.080 
look it doesn't look ginger but it's
actually<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.060> brown<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.500> mint<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.520> I'm

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
actually like brown and then mint so I'm

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.399
