00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.839
 absent from last year I decided 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.740
 do 15 things you did not know about gta 5 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.950
 part 2 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.240
 good and to get down to start 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.639
 first if you steal a store 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 repeatedly the shopkeeper will recognize you and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 will call the police as soon as you enter 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.359
 assholes had Alzheimer's second yes 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.330

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.910
 you can turn off or turn on the lights 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
 12 x remain if you follow a woman at 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 chance will probably speed up the pace 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.120
