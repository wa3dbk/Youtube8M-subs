paper<00:00:39.300> tube<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> cut<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.280> stick

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
paper tube that you cut and just stick

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.430 
paper tube that you cut and just stick
the<00:00:41.730> end<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.180> fabric<00:00:42.480> through<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the end of that fabric through there and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.790 
the end of that fabric through there and
start<00:00:44.399> wrapping<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.940> around

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
start wrapping it around

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.889 
start wrapping it around
I'm<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:47.100> even<00:00:47.399> gluing<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.210> anything<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I'm not even gluing this or anything and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
I'm not even gluing this or anything and
I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.020> it'll<00:00:49.320> hold<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.860> fine<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I think it'll hold just fine but if you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
I think it'll hold just fine but if you
feel<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.539> want<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.809> hot<00:00:52.079> glue<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> end

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
feel like you want to hot glue the end

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.490 
feel like you want to hot glue the end
of<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.840> worry<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.320> your

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
of that you can and don't worry if your

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
of that you can and don't worry if your
fabric<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.070> cut<00:00:56.370> jagged<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.510> frayed

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
fabric is cut jagged or if it's frayed

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
fabric is cut jagged or if it's frayed
it<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.890> doesn't<00:00:59.280> matter<00:01:04.729> wrap<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> fabric

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it really doesn't matter wrap the fabric

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.789 
it really doesn't matter wrap the fabric
all<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.750> around<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> toilet<00:01:07.770> paper

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.700 

just<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> doesn't<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> be

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
just like that and it doesn't have to be

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
just like that and it doesn't have to be
a<00:01:28.740> perfect<00:01:29.070> triangle<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a perfect triangle you want to kind of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140 
a perfect triangle you want to kind of
imperfect<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.909> one

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
imperfect and then I'm going to take one

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330 
imperfect and then I'm going to take one
of<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.360> corners<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> wrap<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.740> into<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of these corners and wrap it into the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.569 
of these corners and wrap it into the
toilet<00:01:35.520> paper<00:01:35.880> -<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> small<00:01:37.619> safety<00:01:38.310> pin

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
toilet paper - I have a small safety pin

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.550 
toilet paper - I have a small safety pin
and<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> pin<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> corner<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and I'm going to pin the corner of this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950 
and I'm going to pin the corner of this
right<00:01:41.100> onto<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.670> excess<00:01:42.210> fabric<00:01:42.509> that's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
right onto this excess fabric that's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.679 
right onto this excess fabric that's
hanging<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:44.369> you'd<00:01:44.579> rather<00:01:44.790> hot<00:01:45.210> glue<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hanging down if you'd rather hot glue it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.780 
hanging down if you'd rather hot glue it
or<00:01:45.899> sew<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.610> just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
or sew it you can do that but I just

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
or sew it you can do that but I just
think<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> safety<00:01:48.479> pin<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> easiest<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
think a safety pin is the easiest and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.580 
think a safety pin is the easiest and
quickest<00:01:50.780> okay<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
quickest okay I don't know if you can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
quickest okay I don't know if you can
see<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.610> pin<00:01:53.970> right

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
see that but I have this pin right

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
see that but I have this pin right
inside<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.869> tube<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.619> none<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
inside that tube so that none of the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.249 
inside that tube so that none of the
safety<00:01:56.490> pin<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.790> showing<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.020> going

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
safety pin is showing and then I'm going

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.170 
safety pin is showing and then I'm going
to<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> excess<00:01:59.310> piece<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.000> the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.110 

here's<00:03:38.890> what<00:03:39.189> that<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.519> going<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.879> look<00:03:40.090> like

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
here's what that is going to look like

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.979 
here's what that is going to look like
from<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.870> side<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:42.360> now<00:03:43.360> we're<00:03:43.629> just<00:03:43.750> going

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
from the side and now we're just going

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.199 
from the side and now we're just going
to<00:03:44.200> make<00:03:44.500> some<00:03:44.530> curls<00:03:45.040> here<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.640> ponytail

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
to make some curls here in the ponytail

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.449 
to make some curls here in the ponytail
I<00:03:46.450> think<00:03:46.989> this<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.290> going<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> stay<00:03:47.920> just<00:03:48.220> like

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
I think this is going to stay just like

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.460 
I think this is going to stay just like
