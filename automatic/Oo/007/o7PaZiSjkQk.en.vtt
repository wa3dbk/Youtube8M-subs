00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
and really they're very similar but the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.340 
and really they're very similar but the
minor<00:00:43.000> scale<00:00:43.239> has<00:00:43.540> just<00:00:43.720> got<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.900> few<00:00:44.140> more

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
there's no rush you know okay now the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.950 
there's no rush you know okay now the
second<00:04:44.370> part<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:44.880> lesson<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.450> walking<00:04:45.870> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
second part of this lesson is walking a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.630 
second part of this lesson is walking a
teacher<00:04:46.200> which<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.620> really<00:04:46.950> important<00:04:47.460> and

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
teacher which is really important and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.450 
teacher which is really important and
thus<00:04:47.880> how<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.420> use<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.900> plectrum<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:50.160> get<00:04:50.340> the

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
thus how to use the plectrum to get the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.370 
thus how to use the plectrum to get the
most<00:04:50.670> speed<00:04:51.060> out<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.420> your<00:04:51.510> playing<00:04:51.720> so

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
most speed out of your playing so

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.320 
most speed out of your playing so
normally<00:04:53.010> when<00:04:53.190> people<00:04:53.220> learn<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.880> play<00:04:54.090> they

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
normally when people learn to play they

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.060 
normally when people learn to play they
start<00:04:54.660> by<00:04:54.810> just<00:04:54.990> plucking<00:04:55.260> downwards<00:04:55.830> but

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
start by just plucking downwards but

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
start by just plucking downwards but
what<00:04:56.490> I'm<00:04:56.580> going<00:04:56.730> to<00:04:56.820> ask<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.330> do<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.930> this

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
what I'm going to ask you to do and this

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.800 
what I'm going to ask you to do and this
is<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.470> key<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:59.040> speed<00:04:59.400> when<00:05:00.150> combined<00:05:00.660> with

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
is the key to speed when combined with

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.330 
is the key to speed when combined with
hammers<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.410> pull-offs<00:05:01.770> it'll<00:05:02.100> all<00:05:02.220> become

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
hammers and pull-offs it'll all become

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.570 
hammers and pull-offs it'll all become
clear<00:05:02.550> shortly<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:04.020> want<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.740> pluck<00:05:05.190> bang

clear shortly I want you to pluck bang

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.340 
clear shortly I want you to pluck bang
words<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.060> upwards<00:05:06.450> with<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.750> plectrum<00:05:06.960> like

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
words and upwards with the plectrum like

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.940 
words and upwards with the plectrum like
this<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:10.140> what<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.350> want<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.740> practice

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
this so what I want you to practice

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.710 
this so what I want you to practice
doing<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.730> go<00:05:11.850> all<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.120> way<00:05:12.240> through<00:05:12.570> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
doing is to go all the way through the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.110 
doing is to go all the way through the
scale<00:05:12.930> plucking<00:05:13.440> down<00:05:13.680> then<00:05:14.220> up<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:14.640> each<00:05:14.790> note

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
scale plucking down then up on each note

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:32.790 
scale plucking down then up on each note
like<00:05:15.480> this

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.589 

okay<00:05:33.800> now<00:05:34.430> I<00:05:34.460> really<00:05:34.849> wanted<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.090> thoroughly

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
okay now I really wanted to thoroughly

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.330 
okay now I really wanted to thoroughly
practice<00:05:36.319> that<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.680> of<00:05:36.770> course<00:05:37.009> you'll<00:05:37.220> go

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
practice that and of course you'll go

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.800 
practice that and of course you'll go
all<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.669> way<00:05:37.759> down<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.240> all<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.389> way<00:05:38.509> back

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
all the way down and all the way back

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.080 
all the way down and all the way back
again<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.379> learn<00:05:39.949> to<00:05:40.250> pluck<00:05:40.460> down<00:05:40.490> and<00:05:40.970> up

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
again and learn to pluck down and up

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.450 
again and learn to pluck down and up
here's<00:05:41.389> the<00:05:41.599> key<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.840> speed<00:05:42.409> because<00:05:43.099> when<00:05:43.310> you

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
here's the key to speed because when you

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.180 
here's the key to speed because when you
watch<00:05:43.789> me<00:05:44.090> you<00:05:44.360> know<00:05:44.509> play<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.800> know<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:45.949> bit<00:05:46.159> of

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
watch me you know play you know a bit of

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.520 
watch me you know play you know a bit of
a<00:05:46.310> solo<00:05:46.759> if<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.330> watch<00:05:47.509> my<00:05:47.750> right<00:05:48.020> hand<00:05:48.319> and

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
a solo if you watch my right hand and

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.529 
a solo if you watch my right hand and
you'll<00:05:48.620> see<00:05:48.860> my<00:05:49.039> plectrum<00:05:49.610> it's<00:05:50.060> not<00:05:50.270> just

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
you'll see my plectrum it's not just

00:05:50.539 --> 00:06:02.590 
you'll see my plectrum it's not just
going<00:05:50.810> down<00:05:50.990> it's<00:05:51.169> going<00:05:51.199> down<00:05:51.440> and<00:05:52.009> up

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.480 

okay<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:03.630> think<00:06:03.780> you<00:06:04.080> understand<00:06:04.650> because<00:06:05.130> that

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
okay I think you understand because that

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.190 
okay I think you understand because that
effectively<00:06:06.120> allows<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.720> pay<00:06:06.870> twice<00:06:07.140> as

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
effectively allows you to pay twice as

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.860 
effectively allows you to pay twice as
quickly<00:06:07.620> as<00:06:08.040> if<00:06:08.310> you<00:06:08.550> as<00:06:09.000> opposed<00:06:09.390> to<00:06:09.540> review

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
quickly as if you as opposed to review

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.480 
quickly as if you as opposed to review
were<00:06:09.990> just<00:06:10.230> plucking<00:06:10.560> bang<00:06:10.740> words<00:06:10.980> I<00:06:11.190> hope

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
were just plucking bang words I hope

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.610 
were just plucking bang words I hope
that<00:06:11.670> makes<00:06:11.850> sense<00:06:12.210> so<00:06:12.810> there<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.200> go<00:06:13.380> that's

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
that makes sense so there you go that's

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.990 
that makes sense so there you go that's
what<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:13.920> want<00:06:14.130> you<00:06:14.190> to<00:06:14.280> practice<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.820> day

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
what I want you to practice the day

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.790 
what I want you to practice the day
you've<00:06:15.270> now<00:06:15.450> got<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:15.840> minor<00:06:16.080> scale<00:06:16.350> to

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
you've now got the minor scale to

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.280 
you've now got the minor scale to
practice<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:18.120> down-up<00:06:18.630> technique<00:06:19.110> with

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
practice and the down-up technique with

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.850 
practice and the down-up technique with
the<00:06:19.380> plectrum

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
the plectrum

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.620 
the plectrum
and<00:06:20.220> once<00:06:20.490> you've<00:06:20.640> got<00:06:20.670> used<00:06:21.090> to<00:06:21.210> plucking

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
and once you've got used to plucking

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.570 
and once you've got used to plucking
down<00:06:21.840> up<00:06:22.020> on<00:06:22.170> each<00:06:22.290> no<00:06:22.590> what<00:06:22.800> you<00:06:22.920> can<00:06:23.100> do<00:06:23.310> is

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
down up on each no what you can do is

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.900 
down up on each no what you can do is
pluck<00:06:24.030> down<00:06:24.360> on<00:06:24.990> one<00:06:25.200> note<00:06:25.470> and<00:06:26.400> then<00:06:26.580> up<00:06:26.730> on

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
pluck down on one note and then up on

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.360 
pluck down on one note and then up on
the<00:06:27.060> next<00:06:27.540> and<00:06:28.290> then<00:06:28.410> down<00:06:28.650> on<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:28.920> next<00:06:29.130> note

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
the next and then down on the next note

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.730 
the next and then down on the next note
and<00:06:30.120> then<00:06:30.240> up<00:06:30.420> on<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.750> neck<00:06:30.900> all<00:06:31.500> the<00:06:31.560> way

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
and then up on the neck all the way

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.350 
and then up on the neck all the way
through<00:06:32.070> the<00:06:32.190> scales<00:06:32.490> so<00:06:32.700> you're<00:06:33.030> plucking

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
through the scales so you're plucking

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.970 
through the scales so you're plucking
each<00:06:33.480> note<00:06:33.780> once<00:06:34.080> but<00:06:34.470> you're<00:06:34.590> doing<00:06:34.860> them

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 
each note once but you're doing them

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.340 
each note once but you're doing them
alternately<00:06:35.760> down<00:06:36.150> and<00:06:36.360> up<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:36.750> hope<00:06:37.200> that

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
alternately down and up I hope that

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.530 
alternately down and up I hope that
makes<00:06:37.560> sense<00:06:37.710> I'm<00:06:38.070> sure<00:06:38.280> it<00:06:38.460> does<00:06:38.670> okay<00:06:39.480> so

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
makes sense I'm sure it does okay so

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.750 
makes sense I'm sure it does okay so
that's<00:06:40.110> enough<00:06:40.230> of<00:06:40.470> me<00:06:40.530> talking<00:06:40.860> now<00:06:41.280> I<00:06:41.490> think

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
that's enough of me talking now I think

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.100 
that's enough of me talking now I think
it's<00:06:42.030> time<00:06:42.150> for<00:06:42.210> you<00:06:42.390> to<00:06:42.510> go<00:06:42.660> and<00:06:42.810> get<00:06:42.930> on<00:06:43.080> with

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
it's time for you to go and get on with

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.810 
it's time for you to go and get on with
that<00:06:43.350> go<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:43.680> learn<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:43.860> you<00:06:44.280> know<00:06:44.400> and<00:06:44.580> do<00:06:44.700> it

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
that go and learn it you know and do it

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.910 
that go and learn it you know and do it
thoroughly<00:06:45.090> be<00:06:45.480> patient<00:06:45.900> with<00:06:46.020> yourself<00:06:46.110> go

eCourse and eventually we're going to
use<00:06:52.440> these<00:06:52.680> scales<00:06:53.040> and<00:06:53.310> I'm<00:06:53.370> going<00:06:53.520> to<00:06:53.580> teach

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
use these scales and I'm going to teach

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.000 
use these scales and I'm going to teach
you<00:06:53.790> how<00:06:54.060> to<00:06:54.090> improvise<00:06:54.750> you<00:06:55.290> know<00:06:55.440> so<00:06:55.650> you<00:06:55.710> can

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
you how to improvise you know so you can

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.860 
you how to improvise you know so you can
play<00:06:56.370> all<00:06:56.550> that<00:06:56.700> cool<00:06:56.970> stuff<00:06:57.120> yourself<00:06:57.720> and

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
play all that cool stuff yourself and

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.870 
play all that cool stuff yourself and
make<00:06:58.140> it<00:06:58.350> up<00:06:58.470> as<00:06:58.650> you're<00:06:58.770> going<00:06:58.950> along<00:06:59.160> so

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880
