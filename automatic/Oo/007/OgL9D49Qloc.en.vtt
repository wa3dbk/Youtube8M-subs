00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 well I'm going to start with this eye what 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.290
 first thing I'm going to do is apply a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.930
 test stops 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.000
 shadows I do it because I have the 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.730
 quite fatty eyelid and if I do not 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 because the schematic shadow does not last me 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 nothing creases are created and then that 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.900
 and now I'm going to take a cream shadow 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.200
 white I will use the time of the ix 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 in milk and I'm going to apply 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.340
 on the mobile eyelid 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.060
 I'm going to blur it with the same finger 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.800
 and I'm going to blur the very well it's a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.450
 pretty fat pencil so if not the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.530
 we blend well 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.730
 probably creates folds and this 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.350
 shadow now I'm applying for 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.500
 enhance the target in the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.450
 eyelid mobile 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:00.340
 then I'm going to take the palette of 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:04.430
 188 neutral tones this white here and 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.860
 white with a brush half and I'm going 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.060
 to apply on this 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.060
 this shadow a cream 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.240
 and I'm going to take a smudge brush 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.930
 as I am here and I will use 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.189
 this brown here its brown medium and what 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.189
 I'm going to mix with 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.960
 I'm going to deposit it in the eye socket 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.960
 upwards 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.090
 and now I'm going to take a brush to blur 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.310
 more accurate than this cove on tip and I'm going 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.649
 to be using this brown here 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.509
 which is right next to the previous one and 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.050
 I'm going to start depositing it in the basin 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.760
 to be like that on the outside of the eye 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.760
 and I will integrate it into the account 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.290

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.239
 I'm going to draw a diagonal on the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.050
 line of the tabs in the part 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.050
