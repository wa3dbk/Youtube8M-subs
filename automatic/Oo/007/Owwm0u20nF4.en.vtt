to go in our bottling bucket beers
primed<00:00:18.590> we<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.770> need<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.010> get<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.250> into<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
bottles so what we're going to do is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.759 
bottles so what we're going to do is
attach<00:00:24.949> our<00:00:25.949> sanitized<00:00:26.699> bottling<00:00:27.769> bottle
