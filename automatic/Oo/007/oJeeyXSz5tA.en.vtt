purely<00:00:44.969> elder<00:00:45.300> scrolls<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.840> fall<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
purely elder scrolls and think fall is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
purely elder scrolls and think fall is
the<00:00:46.379> dumbest<00:00:46.710> shit<00:00:46.920> ever<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.670> are

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the dumbest shit ever and there are

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
the dumbest shit ever and there are
people<00:00:47.969> who<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.059> fallout<00:00:48.390> fans<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
people who are fallout fans and this is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
people who are fallout fans and this is
usually<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.070> Elder<00:00:50.399> Scrolls<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
usually I go to think Elder Scrolls in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
usually I go to think Elder Scrolls in
its<00:00:50.910> fantasy<00:00:51.210> setting<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> dumbest<00:00:52.320> shit

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
its fantasy setting is the dumbest shit

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
its fantasy setting is the dumbest shit
ever<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.670> where<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> lot<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.449> lies

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
ever so that's where a lot of it lies

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.240 
ever so that's where a lot of it lies
but<00:00:54.870> most<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.379> us<00:00:55.469> appreciate<00:00:55.829> just

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
but most of us appreciate just

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
but most of us appreciate just
Bethesda's<00:00:56.940> worlds<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.449> create<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Bethesda's worlds that they create and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
Bethesda's worlds that they create and
the<00:00:58.050> type<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> games<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.250> make<00:00:59.430> because

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the type of games they make because

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.849 
the type of games they make because
they're<00:00:59.940> always<00:01:00.180> freaking<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.829> I

years now mind you he's not talking

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.510 
years now mind you he's not talking
about

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
about

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.740 
about
development<00:04:26.849> cycles<00:04:27.150> here<00:04:27.240> he's<00:04:27.419> talking

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
development cycles here he's talking

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.180 
development cycles here he's talking
about<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.990> space<00:04:28.229> between<00:04:28.440> when<00:04:28.889> we<00:04:29.009> see

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
about the space between when we see

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.670 
about the space between when we see
games<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.699> he's<00:04:30.509> kind<00:04:30.930> as<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.139> point<00:04:31.379> there<00:04:31.560> is

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
games and he's kind as a point there is

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.200 
games and he's kind as a point there is
that<00:04:31.710> Bethesda<00:04:32.009> is<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.550> focused<00:04:32.789> on<00:04:33.000> one

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
that Bethesda is so focused on one

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.450 
that Bethesda is so focused on one
project<00:04:33.389> at<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.750> time<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:35.129> really

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
project at a time that it's a really

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.369 
project at a time that it's a really
long<00:04:35.729> time<00:04:35.970> before<00:04:36.180> we<00:04:36.539> they<00:04:36.930> can't<00:04:37.289> just

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
long time before we they can't just

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.649 
long time before we they can't just
alternate<00:04:37.919> series<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:38.550> like<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:38.909> they

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
alternate series just like that they

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:40.879 
alternate series just like that they
don't<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:39.810> multiple<00:04:40.259> teams<00:04:40.470> where<00:04:40.740> they

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
don't have multiple teams where they

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.860 
don't have multiple teams where they
have<00:04:41.129> this<00:04:41.310> these<00:04:41.729> two<00:04:41.940> focuses<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.629> they<00:04:42.720> can

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
have this these two focuses and they can

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.930 
have this these two focuses and they can
turn<00:04:43.199> out<00:04:43.409> these<00:04:43.620> games<00:04:43.919> but<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.550> think<00:04:44.819> that's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
turn out these games but I think that's

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.100 
turn out these games but I think that's
also<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.210> good<00:04:45.300> thing<00:04:45.659> it's<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.840> bittersweet

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
also a good thing it's a bittersweet

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.540 
also a good thing it's a bittersweet
thing<00:04:46.349> you<00:04:46.560> know<00:04:46.650> we<00:04:46.800> don't<00:04:46.889> see<00:04:47.009> a<00:04:47.099> lot<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.370> our

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
thing you know we don't see a lot of our

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.430 
thing you know we don't see a lot of our
favorite<00:04:47.849> franchises<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:48.960> makes<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.199> so

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
favorite franchises but it makes it so

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.379 
favorite franchises but it makes it so
special<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.009> such<00:04:50.129> a<00:04:50.159> rich<00:04:50.400> experience<00:04:50.550> when

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
special and such a rich experience when

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.480 
special and such a rich experience when
we<00:04:51.479> actually<00:04:51.629> do<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.590> them<00:04:52.860> because<00:04:53.280> it's

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
we actually do get them because it's

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.730 
we actually do get them because it's
such<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.669> long<00:04:54.030> wait<00:04:54.539> personally<00:04:55.379> I'm<00:04:55.530> fine

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
such a long wait personally I'm fine

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.830 
such a long wait personally I'm fine
with<00:04:55.889> either<00:04:55.949> but<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.520> miss<00:04:56.879> fall<00:04:57.150> out<00:04:57.330> more<00:04:57.629> and

I'll<00:04:57.960> end<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.319> with<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.710> because<00:04:59.009> that's<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
I'll end it with that because that's the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
making a new Elder Scrolls game you'd

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.369 
making a new Elder Scrolls game you'd
imagine<00:05:24.419> they<00:05:24.509> predicted<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:24.990> future<00:05:25.110> and

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
imagine they predicted the future and

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.869 
imagine they predicted the future and
knew<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:25.770> game<00:05:25.949> was<00:05:26.039> gonna<00:05:26.219> flop<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.849> a

degree<00:05:27.060> which<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.960> don't<00:05:28.080> think<00:05:28.289> they<00:05:28.500> did<00:05:28.560> I

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
degree which I don't think they did I

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.800 
degree which I don't think they did I
think<00:05:29.219> they<00:05:29.280> expected<00:05:29.400> more<00:05:29.940> out<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.419> so<00:05:30.630> I

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
think they expected more out of it so I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.290 
think they expected more out of it so I
don't<00:05:31.409> know<00:05:31.469> I<00:05:31.530> think<00:05:31.860> it's<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:32.880> know<00:05:33.090> in
