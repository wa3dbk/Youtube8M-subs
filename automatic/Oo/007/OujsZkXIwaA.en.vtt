i haven't tried animation that's that's
a<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.390> question<00:01:48.570> where<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> show<00:01:49.290> live

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
a good question where the show live

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.289 
a good question where the show live
still<00:01:50.189> keeps<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> schedule<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> 15<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
still keeps the schedule of the 15 and

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
pitch here's the first pitch slider that

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.500 
pitch here's the first pitch slider that
just<00:06:03.920> tails<00:06:04.190> out<00:06:04.490> of<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.730> zone<00:06:04.760> its<00:06:05.240> ball<00:06:05.300> one

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
just tails out of the zone its ball one

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.660 
just tails out of the zone its ball one
that's<00:06:06.380> what<00:06:06.500> you<00:06:06.620> have<00:06:06.740> to<00:06:06.860> do<00:06:06.980> against<00:06:07.340> a<00:06:07.400> big

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
that's what you have to do against a big

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.420 
that's what you have to do against a big
sweeping<00:06:08.480> slider<00:06:08.870> like<00:06:09.170> that<00:06:09.410> it<00:06:09.650> starts<00:06:10.250> in

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
sweeping slider like that it starts in

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.220 
sweeping slider like that it starts in
the<00:06:10.490> zone<00:06:10.970> and<00:06:11.240> it's<00:06:11.390> probably<00:06:11.600> gonna<00:06:11.900> finish

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
the zone and it's probably gonna finish

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.990 
the zone and it's probably gonna finish
out<00:06:12.440> of<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:12.740> zone<00:06:12.770> so<00:06:13.160> that's<00:06:13.340> a<00:06:13.460> good<00:06:13.730> job

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
out of the zone so that's a good job

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.170 
out of the zone so that's a good job
just<00:06:14.270> to<00:06:14.300> lay<00:06:14.630> off

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
just to lay off

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.180 
just to lay off
10<00:06:16.990> on<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.350> way<00:06:19.440> swung<00:06:20.440> on<00:06:20.650> and<00:06:20.860> hit<00:06:21.009> in<00:06:21.130> the

10 on the way swung on and hit in the

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.820
