now let's compare the blitz wolf and
this<00:02:46.700> Yomi<00:02:47.150> monopod<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:48.200> check<00:02:48.409> out<00:02:48.620> which<00:02:49.010> one

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
this Yomi monopod to check out which one

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.740 
this Yomi monopod to check out which one
is<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.730> better<00:02:49.879> option<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:50.390> you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
is the better option for you

the<00:02:51.650> Shiomi<00:02:52.099> remote<00:02:52.489> control<00:02:52.940> works<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.629> two

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
the Shiomi remote control works with two

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.369 
the Shiomi remote control works with two
Shiomi<00:02:54.200> camera<00:02:54.739> but<00:02:55.280> not<00:02:55.310> with<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> smartphone

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
Shiomi camera but not with a smartphone

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.600 
Shiomi camera but not with a smartphone
so<00:02:57.379> if<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.680> are<00:02:57.739> planning<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.190> use<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
so if you are planning to use the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.820 
so if you are planning to use the
monopod<00:02:59.030> more<00:02:59.299> often<00:02:59.569> with<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.870> phone<00:03:00.080> you

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
monopod more often with the phone you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.009 
monopod more often with the phone you
can<00:03:01.069> still<00:03:01.310> attach<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.849> camera<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.480> maybe

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
can still attach the camera and maybe

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.990 
can still attach the camera and maybe
get<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.500> remote<00:03:03.860> control<00:03:04.370> without<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
get a remote control without the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.080 
get a remote control without the
original<00:03:05.090> monopod<00:03:05.900> additionally<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:06.980> use<00:03:07.879> my

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
original monopod additionally I use my

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.479 
original monopod additionally I use my
camera<00:03:08.319> preferably<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.620> videos<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.190> take

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
camera preferably for videos and take

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.330 
camera preferably for videos and take
photos<00:03:10.910> with<00:03:11.090> my<00:03:11.239> iPhone<00:03:11.629> so<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.200> think<00:03:12.379> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
photos with my iPhone so I think the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.309 
photos with my iPhone so I think the
Blitz<00:03:13.579> wolf<00:03:13.819> monopod<00:03:14.329> will<00:03:14.840> be<00:03:14.989> my<00:03:15.170> first

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
Blitz wolf monopod will be my first

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.759 
Blitz wolf monopod will be my first
choice

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
choice

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.789 
choice
as<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.819> is<00:03:16.849> more<00:03:17.209> versatile<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:18.019> can<00:03:18.470> use<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
as it is more versatile I can use the

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.220 
as it is more versatile I can use the
smartphone<00:03:19.190> mount<00:03:19.489> or<00:03:19.819> detach<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.840> use

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
smartphone mount or detach it and use

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500 
smartphone mount or detach it and use
the<00:03:21.410> GoPro<00:03:21.560> mount

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.809 

if<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:25.319> just<00:03:25.590> want<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.010> use<00:03:26.159> your<00:03:26.340> monopod

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
if you just want to use your monopod

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.910 
if you just want to use your monopod
with<00:03:27.150> your<00:03:27.330> zero<00:03:27.569> me<00:03:27.629> camera<00:03:28.349> then<00:03:28.890> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
with your zero me camera then the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.190 
with your zero me camera then the
original<00:03:29.250> monopod<00:03:29.970> with<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.450> remote<00:03:30.720> control

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
original monopod with the remote control

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.890 
original monopod with the remote control
is<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.860> better<00:03:32.040> choice<00:03:32.129> for<00:03:32.580> you

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
is the better choice for you

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
is the better choice for you
the<00:03:33.900> Shiomi<00:03:34.319> monopod<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.670> smaller

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the Shiomi monopod is a little smaller

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
the Shiomi monopod is a little smaller
in<00:03:36.209> size<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.780> therefore<00:03:37.230> doesn't<00:03:37.769> extend<00:03:38.129> as

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
in size and therefore doesn't extend as

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.270 
in size and therefore doesn't extend as
much<00:03:38.730> as<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.239> blitzwolfer<00:03:39.629> monopod<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.470> also

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
much as the blitzwolfer monopod I also

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.430 
much as the blitzwolfer monopod I also
think<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.330> blades<00:03:42.569> wolves<00:03:43.019> locking

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
think that the blades wolves locking

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280 
think that the blades wolves locking
mechanism<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.459> more<00:03:44.760> easy<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.269> use<00:03:45.480> as<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
mechanism is more easy to use as the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.589 
mechanism is more easy to use as the
chiami<00:03:46.739> monopod<00:03:47.250> gets<00:03:47.610> stuck<00:03:47.910> from<00:03:48.120> time<00:03:48.420> to

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
chiami monopod gets stuck from time to

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.119 
chiami monopod gets stuck from time to
time

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
time

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.559 
time
despite<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.310> blitz<00:03:50.549> wolf<00:03:50.790> monopod<00:03:51.269> being

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
despite the blitz wolf monopod being

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.199 
despite the blitz wolf monopod being
larger<00:03:52.110> with<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> battery<00:03:53.129> included<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:54.090> is

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
larger with a battery included it is

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.330 
larger with a battery included it is
still<00:03:54.450> lighter<00:03:54.720> than<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.409> Shiomi<00:03:55.860> monopod

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
still lighter than the Shiomi monopod

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.509 
still lighter than the Shiomi monopod
they<00:03:57.090> are<00:03:57.150> both<00:03:57.329> great<00:03:57.629> tools<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.739> think<00:03:59.250> about

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
they are both great tools so think about

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.490 
they are both great tools so think about
which<00:03:59.819> one<00:04:00.060> might<00:04:00.299> work<00:04:00.569> out<00:04:00.810> better<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.170> you

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
which one might work out better for you

which one might work out better for you
