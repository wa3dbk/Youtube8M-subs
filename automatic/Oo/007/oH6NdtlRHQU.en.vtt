00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.670
 we go with the other case where we will also apply the flash technique of 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.190
 filling 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.120
 On a cloudy day the light can be excessively psoe-par to the face the 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120
 we will give more vivacity filling them with a little bit of flash 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.220
 if you do it with manual flash or with manual flash with automatisms once placed 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.949
 the synchronization speed and adjusted the diaphragm based on the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 distance that we are going to place of the person we will do the photo 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.290
 if it is not artificial, we will reduce the power of our flash again 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.830
 cobiÃ¡n we will close or a point of apramp to 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.520
 but be careful one more time 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.829
 do not forget to open a point for the speed 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:46.670
 yes yes no 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 you raise you will put the bottom 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 my now after compensating the speed 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.409
 she well 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.140
 and the background well 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.100
 we own the photographs 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 the photo without flash does not conveniently illuminate the face 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 it shows it very off 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 the photo with flash revive him excessively 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 in the photo with compensated flash the face seems well lit and much 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.030
 more natural 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 if we work with flash ctl we will act in this way also some of these 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.520
 pleasures allow you to reduce the exposure with which hughes 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.040
 exposure values 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 every euro that you reduce in your flash is how to reduce a point the exposure 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.120
 but the power of the flash is reduced so you do not have to compensate for the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.120
 speed 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.370
 with the ctl flash we can also forget the shadows that fall on a 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.370
 object a person on a sunny day 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.210
 but here you have to be careful in one thing 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 the light of the flash impose to all type of light nevertheless to the sunlight it is added 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 creating light on exposures in the image 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.090
 to avoid this once the sync speed is set home north 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.780
 and placed between the distances that the flash sends before shooting 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.349
 we will directly reduce a little bit the power of this as we have 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.349
 learned 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.419
 We can also do this technique with plasma 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.249
 you have to know that the shutter speed does not affect the health of flash 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.539
 it is with the diaphragm only with which this type of light is regulated 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.849
 look if not this sequence of photos we throw the first one with flash to the 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.829
 synchronization speed 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.900
 and in the following we keep the diaphragm and the distance 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.370
 but we are putting slower speeds however the scene 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.370
 it becomes clear as we go the speed 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.620
 once few patica with your phrase you will understand as not only outdoors 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.510
 if not practically anywhere 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.939
 It is very interesting to compensate the exposure as we have shown you 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.680
 in many camera models the retractable crank that they incorporate allows 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.019
 also compensate the exposure 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.239
 these phrases can take us on more than one occasion of pure gold always and 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.799
 when the subject is near 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.309
 About three meters, as we told you at the time, they are ideal 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.989
 also to photograph children for its power is not very big and so 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.779
 both barely bother them 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.529
 let's see these pictures 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.180
 In the first, the camera flash was used without compensating the presence of 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.940
 this kind of lights very obvious 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.649
 there are whitish areas and the colors are 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.649
 a little diluted 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:42.680
 in these others however the flash was compensated by exposing it point and a half 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.180
 the result is much more natural and also the colors are more 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.520
 contrasted even in some we could come to doubt 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.919
 yes yes they did with flash 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.309
 that's the interesting thing about compensating the flash we benefit from this 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.309
 fantastic light but in such a way that it seems natural 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.079
 to finish in the same way that compensated fashions position when 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.689
 the white predominated our picture we should do when we have a 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 similar situation that we work purchases 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:16.199
 in this way we will comment on the power of our flash or on how we will expose 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.289
 We are through the USA 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.289
 the differences between one photo and another will be appreciated immediately
