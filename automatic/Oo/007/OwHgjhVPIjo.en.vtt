draw and the third Test match we lost so

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.300 
draw and the third Test match we lost so
it<00:03:07.930> was<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.080> very<00:03:08.350> close<00:03:08.650> series<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.160> West

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
it was a very close series and West

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.240 
it was a very close series and West
Indies<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.060> 86<00:03:10.600> 88<00:03:11.050> was<00:03:11.650> one<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:11.980> best

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
Indies that in 86 88 was one of the best

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.430 
Indies that in 86 88 was one of the best
sides<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.880> world<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.660> was<00:03:13.810> very<00:03:14.170> difficult

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
sides in the world it was very difficult

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.160 
sides in the world it was very difficult
for<00:03:14.739> any<00:03:15.100> team<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.790> even<00:03:16.060> come<00:03:16.269> closer<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.989> West

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
for any team to even come closer to West

India and Pakistan team did unruhe

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.480 
India and Pakistan team did unruhe
now<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.850> think<00:03:19.970> Imran<00:03:20.420> Khan<00:03:20.980> gave<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> calmness

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
now I think Imran Khan gave a calmness

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.170 
now I think Imran Khan gave a calmness
and<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.330> direction<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> cricket<00:03:25.490> team<00:03:25.670> then

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
and a direction to a cricket team then

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.390 
and a direction to a cricket team then
the<00:03:26.209> one<00:03:26.660> team<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:26.990> actually<00:03:27.410> matched<00:03:27.680> the

they had a lot of good players but they

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.540 
they had a lot of good players but they
lost<00:04:09.290> three<00:04:10.290> out<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.650> five<00:04:10.830> matches<00:04:11.129> and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.030 
lost three out of the five matches and
and<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.180> know<00:04:12.269> one<00:04:13.049> more<00:04:13.260> one<00:04:13.500> more<00:04:13.530> loss<00:04:13.860> they

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040

would they were out of the tournament
and<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.780> guess<00:04:15.959> something<00:04:16.260> snapped<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.349 
and I guess something snapped and
something<00:04:17.220> happened<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.699> then<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
something happened and then then the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.099 
something happened and then then the
team<00:04:18.690> turned<00:04:18.930> around<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.440> Imran<00:04:21.109> started

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109

batting<00:04:22.410> at<00:04:22.500> number<00:04:22.710> three<00:04:23.150> score<00:04:24.150> runs<00:04:24.360> there

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
batting at number three score runs there

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.000 
batting at number three score runs there
and<00:04:25.590> somehow<00:04:26.340> he<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:27.540> know<00:04:27.660> got<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.590> best<00:04:28.860> out
