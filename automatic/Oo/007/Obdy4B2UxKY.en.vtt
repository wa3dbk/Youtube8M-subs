can't really sculpt them as well but

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.140 
can't really sculpt them as well but
that<00:02:27.870> might<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.410> my<00:02:29.480> incapable<00:02:30.480> nurse<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and I don't whether it's just because

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.090 
and I don't whether it's just because
the<00:02:35.520> brush<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.760> really<00:02:36.000> thick<00:02:36.360> or<00:02:36.660> what<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.710> um

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I do more of a close-up I think like

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.080 
I do more of a close-up I think like
just<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.670> show<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.960> get<00:03:27.960> back<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.290> focus

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090
