and some wild plants are probably the
easiest<00:01:49.259> tank<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
easiest tank you can have if you're a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.679

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
this isn't doing really well this is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.789 
this isn't doing really well this is
hideous

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
hideous

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.940
