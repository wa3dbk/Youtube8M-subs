00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.660
 the future that are pretty strong that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.570
 it hurt all of us 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.980
 it was noted that we were not in that game 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.480
 the same 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.180
 that we were playing in matches 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.170
 before us a break for 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.440
 part of everything and I think that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 the technician did not or did not know that 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.350
 we are quite aware of the error 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 we made not by winning a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.790
 classic we can afford or the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.260
 advantage of the other games played in 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.170
 different way to the contrary we have to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.449
 the performance of keeping it knowing 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 that have important dates but has 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.480
 a super nice option to have that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.160
 talk has returned to the tournament they gave 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 enough results that favored us 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.040
 and the culprits are us 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 first responsible for this and the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.470
 first also that the weekend 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.629
 we want to reverse the bad image that 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.800
 we leave in san felipe and super complicated 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.690
 a rival who is expanding his option 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.489
 to enter the playoffs 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.280
 previous one already does a little what the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.920
 descent and the group but they are going to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.230
 have a chance 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.259
 before us to be able to enter between 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.750
 eight us with the conviction and with the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.360
 intact faith that on these two dates 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.330
 we can sanz if they continue to give 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.530
 things still power is to have the illusion 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.810
 that I'll turn the championship on 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 this regular phase is not going to be for nothing 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.710
 easy a court that we're not 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.340
 used to them more than us 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.630
 but but we will try as I say 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.930
 change the image that we leave the last 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.119
 weekend we have the weapons for 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.700
 do it and we have the conviction also 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.190
 in the group is aware that of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.600
 that we are on the right foot from that of 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.890
 We have done enough good things is 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.360
 here but nothing has been achieved yet and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.460
 pretty good today practiced 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.580
 football in its normal form recovery 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.110
 has been pretty good and renny in the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.060
 portico inside the court of a 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.220
 super important person gives you a lot 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.509
 confidence a lot of security came 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.490
 doing pretty good until the last 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.440
 match he played and he gets the bad 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.610
 fortunate to get injured but 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.679
 he has the chance to play again 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.709
 Hopefully the advantage because a 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.149
 great archer a great person and all 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.900
 we are very confident that Saturday 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.430
 what is going to be 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.259
 in good shape 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.600
 to see is felipe a super game 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.600
 important also not for not playing the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.700
 day on Friday with san felipe 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.980
 we lost the match mauro came in with all 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.080
 he wins and intends to do well 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.930
 there he played a game that in the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.189
 which not all of us enter plugged 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.859
 but felipe has the opportunity 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.159
 again on Saturday 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.650
 with him we understand each other quite well 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.510
 play what 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.460
 and that the truth has been quite 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.380
 important for the team hopefully 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.910
 can return to the level that I am that has 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.670
 come showing hopefully to return to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.340
 goal that is super important to him 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.680
 and also for the team so the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.560
 independent the one who plays is more gold 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.620
 felipe me if it's my turn to be important 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.480
 is that it is in benefit the team continues 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.340
 hits us pretty I think with san 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.920
 felipe we made the mistake of thinking of 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.330
 that we would win it only with so that 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.880
 with the shirt of which it was not like that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.069
 we went very relaxed we did the first 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.020
 goal and we believe that the match is already 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.250
 finished and it was not like that in front there was 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.140
 a rival who is fighting for not 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.209
 descend that showed more desire than 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.220
 us to go not so much football but 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.600
 when he had to run more than the rival 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.940
 sometimes it helps you to win matches 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.069
 and that's what happened to us they had more 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.840
 more hungry than us we saw a 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.000
 team relaxed party in many 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.970
 Sometimes things that happen to us 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.739
 previously especially in environments of 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.150
 opening and that is what we do not have to 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.980
 Go through the same thing again 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.930
 a conversation and a reprimand for 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.640
 part of the technician who has all the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.440
 reason and we agree the whole campus with 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.240
 what happened so we hope not to return 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.820
 I think to repeat 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.410
 what happens in a moment that serves us 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.720
 to react knowing that it comes in 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.520
 super important instances about all 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.340
 the premises where this type of 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.800
 advantage you can stay outside in the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.700
 first axis in the first heel can be 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.920
 that there does not have the prominence 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.270
 during many passages of the game but 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.390
 I think at the right time where it has 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.790
 appeared with Catholic did not enter much 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.890
 at stake but I had the open open the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.750
 key so that the party would have 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.630
 define with the 'u' either then are 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.959
 there's a lot there's a lot of reason but 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.959
 as well 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.540
 in this case what I have to do the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.820
 scorer and be in the moments 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.710
 precise where the team needs it most 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.810
 in the independent care of everything 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.850
 they are the ones who send in and out 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.960
 of the court or if they are going to start a 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.790
 conversation with them always have 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.920
 to be with respect never to exceed the 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.370
 limits because at the time of them from 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.380
 inform those who never believe you 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.780
 there independent or that they had the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.510
 true or things are not like 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.730
 as they say they are in the room but 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.000
 you have the credibility of the court in 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.200
 this case it was up to gonzalo we waited 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.790
 what 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.560
 that things like this do not happen again 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.720
 type because losing players by 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.760
 entire port or things that already happen 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.120
 off the court and out 90 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.560
 minutes are perfectly avoidable well 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.980
 that we have to control that is 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.590
 dedicate ourselves to play more than anything 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.020
 and the subject of the referees knowing that 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.570
 the arbitration in the classic was very 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.010
 questioned out there we can from here 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.350
 from now on win a little hand by 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.600
 which we have to be prepared and 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.020
 have a pretty strong head like 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.710
 to hold out maybe the work the subject what 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.710
 that we can come
