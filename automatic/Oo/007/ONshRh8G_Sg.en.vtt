00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
liked this part was not like that when I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
liked this part was not like that when I
got<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> patch<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.870> pretty

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
got it out of patch it was it was pretty

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
got it out of patch it was it was pretty
dips<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> skinny<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> use<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.760> tweezer<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
dips and skinny so I use a tweezer to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.899 
dips and skinny so I use a tweezer to
squeeze<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> part<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.670> put

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
squeeze the part out and then I put

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.500 
squeeze the part out and then I put
foundation<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.590> part<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> bob<00:01:09.299> was

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
foundation in my part the bob was

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.929 
foundation in my part the bob was
actually<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.939> asymmetrical

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
actually a little bit more asymmetrical

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.530 
actually a little bit more asymmetrical
so<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.510> side<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.020> actually<00:01:13.520> longer<00:01:14.540> than

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so this side was actually longer than

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.280 
so this side was actually longer than
this<00:01:15.750> side

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this side

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.969 
this side
but<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> made<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:18.290> kind<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> even<00:01:19.799> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but I kind of made it kind of even so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.920 
but I kind of made it kind of even so
they're<00:01:20.159> pretty<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> same<00:01:21.119> length<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
they're pretty much the same length I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
they're pretty much the same length I
just<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.280> side

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
just go a little bit off of this side

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.469 
just go a little bit off of this side
and<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.580> bang<00:01:26.850> was<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> little<00:01:27.390> bit

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and this the bang was a little bit

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.039 
and this the bang was a little bit
longer<00:01:27.750> too<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.119> did<00:01:30.119> some<00:01:30.329> layers<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
longer too so I did some layers in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.550 
longer too so I did some layers in the
front<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.729> put<00:01:32.939> baby<00:01:33.119> powder<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.320> week

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
front and I put baby powder on this week

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
front and I put baby powder on this week
because<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.460> shiny<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
because it was a little bit shiny and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.730 
because it was a little bit shiny and
that<00:01:36.570> took<00:01:36.810> away<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> whole<00:01:37.470> Ricky<00:01:38.220> look<00:01:38.520> I

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
that took away the whole Ricky look I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.410 
that took away the whole Ricky look I
think<00:01:40.740> isn't<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.119> cute

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
think isn't really it's a really cute

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.190 
think isn't really it's a really cute
look<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.229> different<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
look and it's different for me because I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.330 
look and it's different for me because I
usually<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.610> longer<00:01:48.030> weeks<00:01:49.340> I've

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
usually like the the longer weeks I've

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.679 
usually like the the longer weeks I've
been<00:01:50.399> doing<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> straight<00:01:51.180> look<00:01:51.420> slightly

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
been doing the straight look slightly

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.179 
been doing the straight look slightly
with<00:01:52.049> visa

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
with visa

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.230 
with visa
but<00:01:55.179> I<00:01:55.539> wanted<00:01:55.869> something<00:01:56.640> shorter<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.909> metal

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
but I wanted something shorter and metal

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.800 
but I wanted something shorter and metal
Bob<00:01:58.420> but<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.960> have<00:01:59.259> my<00:01:59.499> hair<00:02:00.810> braided

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
Bob but I have my hair braided

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.340 
Bob but I have my hair braided
underneath<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:03.460> it's<00:02:03.909> not<00:02:04.179> like<00:02:04.929> bumps

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
underneath so it's not like bumps

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.919 
underneath so it's not like bumps
everywhere<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.189> hump<00:02:06.429> so<00:02:07.299> it<00:02:07.450> lays<00:02:07.600> pretty

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
everywhere and hump so it lays pretty

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.509 
everywhere and hump so it lays pretty
flat<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.700> week<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.739> thin<00:02:12.099> though

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
flat this week is kind of thin though

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.240 
flat this week is kind of thin though
like<00:02:13.299> I<00:02:13.569> wish<00:02:13.750> they<00:02:13.900> had<00:02:13.930> five<00:02:14.769> weeks<00:02:15.129> that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
like I wish they had five weeks that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.309 
like I wish they had five weeks that
we're<00:02:15.489> kind<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.730> like<00:02:15.849> thicker<00:02:16.239> like<00:02:17.019> more

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
we're kind of like thicker like more

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.160 
we're kind of like thicker like more
more<00:02:17.920> full<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.519> back<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.629> I<00:02:19.870> think<00:02:19.900> this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
more full in the back but I think this

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.559 
more full in the back but I think this
looks<00:02:20.410> pretty<00:02:20.680> natural<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.519> posted<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.360> picture

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569

on Instagram yesterday and then one of
the<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:26.849> think<00:02:27.849> it's<00:02:28.150> probably<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.599> subscriber

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the I think it's probably a subscriber

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.839 
the I think it's probably a subscriber
she<00:02:29.620> actually<00:02:29.890> thought<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.430> was<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.670> a

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
she actually thought this was like a

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.780

sew-in<00:02:31.379> but<00:02:32.379> yeah<00:02:32.829> I<00:02:32.890> don't<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.610> I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
don't I don't do so in that kind of

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.420 
don't I don't do so in that kind of
stuff<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.099> takes<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.519> on<00:02:48.640> my<00:02:49.150> opinion<00:02:49.390> so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.300 
yeah I think this is a really cute look
I<00:02:54.099> think<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.700> kind<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.970> makes<00:02:55.180> me<00:02:55.359> look<00:02:55.569> more

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
I think it kind of makes me look more

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.870 
I think it kind of makes me look more
mature<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.700> feel<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.540> look<00:02:59.079> 24<00:02:59.799> now

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
mature I feel like I look 24 now

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.080 
mature I feel like I look 24 now
I<00:03:00.910> look<00:03:01.240> like<00:03:01.270> me<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.550> that's<00:03:03.700> not<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.880> bad

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
I look like me and that's not a bad

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.160 
I look like me and that's not a bad
thing<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.720> don't<00:03:04.750> want<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.110> look<00:03:05.200> matronly<00:03:05.500> but

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.750 

she<00:03:11.170> bought<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.560> from<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:12.220> local<00:03:12.460> beauty

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
she bought this from a local beauty

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.250 
she bought this from a local beauty
supply<00:03:12.910> store<00:03:13.480> though<00:03:13.840> she<00:03:13.930> probably

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
supply store though she probably

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.130 
supply store though she probably
overpaid<00:03:15.070> for<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:16.120> looked<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.780> up<00:03:16.900> on

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
overpaid for it but I looked it up on

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.200 
overpaid for it but I looked it up on
hair<00:03:17.590> sisters<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:18.550> week<00:03:18.760> was<00:03:18.910> only

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
hair sisters and this week was only

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.600 
hair sisters and this week was only
twenty<00:03:19.570> three<00:03:19.600> ninety<00:03:20.050> five<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.770> it's

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
twenty three ninety five so it's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.070 
twenty three ninety five so it's
definitely<00:03:22.120> affordable<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:24.180> would<00:03:25.180> like<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.930> do

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
definitely affordable I would like to do

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.080 
definitely affordable I would like to do
another<00:03:26.230> bob<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:27.100> would<00:03:27.280> probably<00:03:27.490> go<00:03:27.760> for

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
another bob I would probably go for

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.910 
another bob I would probably go for
something<00:03:28.810> with<00:03:28.990> more<00:03:29.140> highlights<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.250> so

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
something with more highlights in it so

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.890 
something with more highlights in it so
that's<00:03:32.920> what<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.130> probably<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.690> cap

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
that's what I probably do and the cap

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.460 
that's what I probably do and the cap
construction<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.680> pretty<00:03:35.920> standard<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.900> two

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
construction is pretty standard it's two

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.310 
construction is pretty standard it's two
combs<00:03:38.940> no<00:03:39.940> it's<00:03:40.180> one<00:03:40.390> come<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.810> back<00:03:40.990> and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
combs no it's one come in the back and

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.130 
combs no it's one come in the back and
then<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> parking<00:03:42.730> area<00:03:42.910> there's<00:03:43.870> two

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
then in the parking area there's two

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.520 
then in the parking area there's two
cones<00:03:45.240> just<00:03:46.240> in<00:03:46.360> case<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.720> want<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:46.960> to<00:03:47.170> press

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
cones just in case you want it to press

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.620 
cones just in case you want it to press
apart<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.340> then<00:03:48.520> blend<00:03:49.000> your<00:03:49.120> hair<00:03:49.330> with<00:03:49.480> it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
apart and then blend your hair with it

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.450 
apart and then blend your hair with it
but<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.810> never<00:03:50.110> do<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.530> because<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:50.950> natural

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
but I never do that because I'm natural

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.810 
but I never do that because I'm natural
and<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.330> wouldn't<00:03:52.570> work<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:54.370> that's<00:03:54.580> all

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
and that wouldn't work think that's all

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.060 
and that wouldn't work think that's all
like<00:03:55.240> I<00:03:55.570> didn't<00:03:56.110> do<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.410> demo<00:03:56.890> video

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
like I didn't do like a demo video

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.040 
like I didn't do like a demo video
because<00:03:57.520> Bob<00:03:57.940> weights<00:03:58.360> are<00:03:58.570> pretty<00:03:58.810> straight

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
because Bob weights are pretty straight

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.810 
because Bob weights are pretty straight
forward<00:03:59.220> I<00:04:01.320> like<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.500> have<00:04:02.680> my<00:04:02.890> bangs<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.490> little

does<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:10.060> does<00:04:10.120> mimic<00:04:10.600> like<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.960> sew-in<00:04:11.740> look<00:04:12.160> in

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400
