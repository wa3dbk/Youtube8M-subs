00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
prom her hair and she lived to make that

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.399 
prom her hair and she lived to make that
decision<00:04:11.889> maybe<00:04:12.280> when<00:04:12.519> she's<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:13.019> 15<00:04:14.019> or<00:04:14.049> 16

decision maybe when she's like 15 or 16

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.640 
decision maybe when she's like 15 or 16
and<00:04:15.069> if<00:04:15.579> she<00:04:15.730> once<00:04:15.969> one<00:04:16.239> then<00:04:16.539> she<00:04:16.989> can<00:04:17.139> get<00:04:17.349> one

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
and if she once one then she can get one

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.310 
and if she once one then she can get one
but<00:04:18.519> anytime<00:04:19.180> before<00:04:19.389> that<00:04:19.720> she's<00:04:20.079> going<00:04:20.229> to

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
but anytime before that she's going to

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.749 
but anytime before that she's going to
be<00:04:20.410> natural<00:04:21.419> because<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:24.220> jaunt<00:04:24.550> that

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
be natural because that jaunt that

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.300 
be natural because that jaunt that
