there's<00:00:00.299> always<00:00:00.420> got<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.659> lot<00:00:00.810> of<00:00:00.840> climbing<00:00:01.079> a

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
there's always got a lot of climbing a

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.439 
there's always got a lot of climbing a
lot<00:00:01.350> of<00:00:01.469> mountain<00:00:01.800> stages<00:00:02.149> it's<00:00:03.149> not<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.360> to

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
lot of mountain stages it's not going to

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.289 
lot of mountain stages it's not going to
be<00:00:03.510> easy<00:00:03.629> by<00:00:03.870> any<00:00:03.899> means<00:00:04.170> but<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:05.040> see<00:00:05.400> compared

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
be easy by any means but I see compared

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.670 
be easy by any means but I see compared
to<00:00:06.330> some<00:00:06.569> other<00:00:06.600> years<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.350> don't<00:00:07.500> have<00:00:07.649> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
to some other years so we don't have a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.190 
to some other years so we don't have a
really<00:00:08.160> big<00:00:08.340> days<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.880> 5,000<00:00:09.510> meters<00:00:09.719> plus

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
really big days of 5,000 meters plus

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
really big days of 5,000 meters plus
climbing<00:00:10.740> day<00:00:10.980> up<00:00:11.130> today<00:00:11.460> but<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.849> didn't

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
climbing day up today but it didn't

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.360 
climbing day up today but it didn't
still<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.389> certainly<00:00:13.019> difficult<00:00:13.259> pink<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
still be certainly difficult pink on the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.980 
still be certainly difficult pink on the
first<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> first<00:00:15.059> half<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.839> more

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
first the first half is going to be more

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.410 
first the first half is going to be more
about<00:00:16.230> staying<00:00:16.770> out<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.949> trouble<00:00:17.070> then<00:00:17.609> then

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
about staying out of trouble then then

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.320 
about staying out of trouble then then
making<00:00:18.660> big<00:00:18.930> differences<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.039> always

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
making big differences but it's always

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.779 
making big differences but it's always
hard<00:00:21.330> lots<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> climbing<00:00:22.800> slightly<00:00:23.490> more<00:00:23.640> I'd

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
hard lots of climbing slightly more I'd

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.040 
hard lots of climbing slightly more I'd
say<00:00:23.970> slightly<00:00:24.210> more<00:00:24.420> favorable<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
say slightly more favorable to the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439 
say slightly more favorable to the
climbers<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:26.250> climbing<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.210> every

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you were all very strongly this year is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
you were all very strongly this year is
a<00:00:33.090> route<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:34.020> will<00:00:34.110> suit<00:00:34.320> your

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a route that you think will suit your

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.490 
a route that you think will suit your
own<00:00:34.590> characteristics<00:00:35.370> no<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> i<00:00:36.450> I'd<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
own characteristics no I i I'd like to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
own characteristics no I i I'd like to
think<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.059> performance

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
think so I'm here to see my performance

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
think so I'm here to see my performance
in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> uphill<00:00:39.960> time<00:00:40.140> trial<00:00:40.440> wasn't<00:00:40.649> anywhere

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
in the uphill time trial wasn't anywhere

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.580 
in the uphill time trial wasn't anywhere
where<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> needed<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.600> 44<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.410> least

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
where it needed to be 44 at least

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.799 
where it needed to be 44 at least
holding<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> place<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.550> GC<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.090> where<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
holding the place on GC where where I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.229 
holding the place on GC where where I
was<00:00:46.250> certainly<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> few<00:00:47.730> few<00:00:48.090> areas

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
was certainly there's a few few areas

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.360 
was certainly there's a few few areas
that<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.530> improve<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.070> from

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that I can that I can improve on from

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
that I can that I can improve on from
from<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> last<00:00:51.600> two<00:00:51.780> years<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.230> going

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
from from the last two years to going

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
from from the last two years to going
into<00:00:52.770> next<00:00:52.890> year<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.699> said<00:00:54.449> there's<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
into next year and I said there's a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
into next year and I said there's a
reasonably<00:00:55.590> good<00:00:55.620> course<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.190> me<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
reasonably good course for me and of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
reasonably good course for me and of
course<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.329> happened<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.899> depend<00:00:58.770> on

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
course it all happened all depend on

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.139 
course it all happened all depend on
what<00:00:58.980> happens<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> three<00:00:59.760> weeks<00:00:59.879> there

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
what happens in the three weeks there

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
what happens in the three weeks there
you've<00:01:00.960> said<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> folks<00:01:01.829> than

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you've said that you got a folks than

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.969 
you've said that you got a folks than
the<00:01:02.100> Giro<00:01:02.340> rather<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> tour<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.979> how

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the Giro rather than the tour and how

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.350 
the Giro rather than the tour and how
will<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.220> program<00:01:05.580> change<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.030> terms<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
will your program change in terms of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.940 
will your program change in terms of
preparation<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.439> terms<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> build

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
preparation for that in terms you build

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
preparation for that in terms you build
up<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> race<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.900> keeps<00:01:09.900> things<00:01:10.140> pretty

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
up for the race it keeps things pretty

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.990 
up for the race it keeps things pretty
much<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> same<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.430> course<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> Giro

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
much the same but of course the Giro

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
much the same but of course the Giro
coming<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.450> May<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.840> opposed<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> July<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
coming in May as opposed to July you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.950 
coming in May as opposed to July you
start<00:01:14.850> everything<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.540> earlier<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
start everything a little bit earlier so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
start everything a little bit earlier so
i<00:01:16.140> might<00:01:16.380> add<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> few<00:01:16.950> more<00:01:17.009> races<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
i might add a few more races in the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
i might add a few more races in the
early<00:01:18.270> season<00:01:18.450> two<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:19.710> days
