parts very tough you have to apply a lot
of<00:01:26.970> pressure<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> break<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
of pressure you're not going to break it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.800 
of pressure you're not going to break it
but<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.180> power<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.720> the

but just use all your power to the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.390 
but just use all your power to the
little<00:01:31.290> gaps<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.680> inside<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> controller

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
little gaps are inside the controller

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940 
little gaps are inside the controller
and<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.180> try<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> pry<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.750> apart<00:01:33.960> takes<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and just try to pry it apart takes a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
and just try to pry it apart takes a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
thought I was going to break it the
first<00:01:39.060> time<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.329> did<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:40.740> all

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
first time I did it but just use all

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
first time I did it but just use all
your<00:01:41.100> strength<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.390> try<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
your strength if you can and just try to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
your strength if you can and just try to
pry<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.320> apart<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.860> they'll<00:01:44.009> fly<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
pry it apart and they'll fly off like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
pry it apart and they'll fly off like
that<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.509> don't<00:01:45.930> worry<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that and don't worry it's not going to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
that and don't worry it's not going to
break<00:01:46.890> you'll<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.430> fine<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.540> first

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
break you'll be fine that's your first

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
break you'll be fine that's your first
step<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.380> exposes<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
step because now that exposes all of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.240 
step because now that exposes all of
your<00:01:51.210> screws<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.799> take<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> back

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
your screws so you can take the back

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.880 
your screws so you can take the back
panel<00:01:53.670> apart<00:01:53.939> there<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.960> five<00:01:55.200> total<00:01:55.439> screws

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
panel apart there are five total screws

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.490 
panel apart there are five total screws
in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.630> two<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.810> each<00:01:57.960> side<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.409> have

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
in the back two on each side you have

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.780 
in the back two on each side you have
worn<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> middle<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.399> under<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
worn in the middle there under the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
worn in the middle there under the
battery<00:02:00.000> pack<00:02:00.360> where<00:02:01.229> there's<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
battery pack where there's a really a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
battery pack where there's a really a
sticker<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.610> took<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
sticker there but I took that off see it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
sticker there but I took that off see it
goes<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:05.159> need<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> remove<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
goes right there we need to remove that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
goes right there we need to remove that
so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.390> gain<00:02:06.540> access<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.740> important

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so you can gain access to the important

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
so you can gain access to the important
screw<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.149> holds<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.569> entire<00:02:09.810> group

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
screw which holds the entire group

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
screw which holds the entire group
filler<00:02:10.410> together<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.580> want<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
filler together so you want to take that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
filler together so you want to take that
apart<00:02:12.480> right<00:02:12.629> away

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
apart right away

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
apart right away
the<00:02:13.709> other<00:02:13.830> four<00:02:14.130> screws<00:02:14.520> there<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.120> up

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the other four screws there was a one up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.270 
the other four screws there was a one up
the<00:02:15.360> top<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> bottom<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.950> side<00:02:17.130> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the top and the bottom on the side you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.550 
the top and the bottom on the side you
can<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.700> there<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.690> bottom<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.350> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
can see right there on the bottom of the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280 
can see right there on the bottom of the
handle<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:21.420> kind<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.600> hard<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.110> can't

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
handle it's kind of hard to see it can't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
handle it's kind of hard to see it can't
let<00:02:22.410> focus<00:02:22.709> right<00:02:22.860> now<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.450> one<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
let focus right now the one in the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.900 
let focus right now the one in the
middle<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.260> said<00:02:25.500> -<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:26.310> those<00:02:26.430> triggers

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
middle like I said - on those triggers

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.000 
middle like I said - on those triggers
and<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> bottom<00:02:28.080> which<00:02:28.590> would<00:02:28.800> equal

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and one of the bottom which would equal

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.070 
and one of the bottom which would equal
5<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.120> we're<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.630> through<00:02:30.930> this

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
5 so we're going to go through this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.750 
5 so we're going to go through this
really<00:02:31.500> quick<00:02:31.890> I'm<00:02:32.069> not<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> show<00:02:32.580> me

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
really quick I'm not going to show me

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.510 
really quick I'm not going to show me
doing<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.470> said<00:02:34.530> use<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.069> Torx

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
doing it but like I said use that Torx

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.340 
doing it but like I said use that Torx
t8<00:02:36.300> h<00:02:36.690> uh<00:02:38.120> tool<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> security<00:02:40.140> tool

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
t8 h uh tool it is a security tool

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.320 
t8 h uh tool it is a security tool
because<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.069> screws<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.700> these<00:02:41.850> have<00:02:42.120> that

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
because the screws on these have that

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.770 
because the screws on these have that
little<00:02:42.510> hole<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.520> screw<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.510> don't

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
little hole in the screw so you don't

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.080 
little hole in the screw so you don't
it's<00:02:46.260> made<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.769> can't<00:02:47.040> mod<00:02:47.220> them<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.880> make

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it's made so you can't mod them so make

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.550 
it's made so you can't mod them so make
sure<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.239> get<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.450> tool<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.230> once<00:02:49.440> you're

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
sure you get that tool and once you're

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170 
sure you get that tool and once you're
taking<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:49.950> your<00:02:50.130> screws<00:02:50.430> apart<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
taking all your screws apart as you can

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.370 
taking all your screws apart as you can
see<00:02:51.360> at<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.600> fast<00:02:51.810> forward<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> little<00:02:52.260> bit

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
see at the fast forward a little bit

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.630 
see at the fast forward a little bit
that'd<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.739> boring<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.100> watch<00:02:53.340> me<00:02:53.489> take

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
that'd be boring you watch me take

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.150 
that'd be boring you watch me take
screws<00:02:53.940> apart<00:02:54.239> once<00:02:55.080> all<00:02:55.320> five<00:02:55.650> are<00:02:55.950> out<00:02:56.130> you

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
screws apart once all five are out you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.180 
screws apart once all five are out you
can<00:02:56.519> now<00:02:56.970> open<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> controller<00:02:58.440> I'll<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.040> to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
can now open the controller I'll have to

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.130 
can now open the controller I'll have to
do<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.519> just<00:02:59.670> pry<00:03:00.209> apart<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.600> shelves<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.050> you

can see cool front and the back

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.550 
can see cool front and the back
right<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:06.180> wiggle<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.989> out<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.410> there

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
right now it's wiggle that out and there

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
right now it's wiggle that out and there
you<00:03:07.650> go<00:03:07.860> you're<00:03:08.190> exposing<00:03:08.910> all<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.209> really

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
now you put on the shell it's pretty

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.979 
now you put on the shell it's pretty
simple<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.060> back<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.540> want<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.780> line<00:03:18.959> up

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
simple the back you just want to line up

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.440 
simple the back you just want to line up
where<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> battery<00:03:19.890> pack<00:03:20.130> would<00:03:20.310> go<00:03:20.549> just

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
where the battery pack would go just

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.310 
where the battery pack would go just
trying<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:23.280> now<00:03:23.660> put<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.989> like<00:03:25.200> I'm

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
trying to for now put that on like I'm

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.930 
trying to for now put that on like I'm
doing<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.400> you're<00:03:26.519> going<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.670> want<00:03:26.880> to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
doing here but you're going to want to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.550 
doing here but you're going to want to
push<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.360> triggers<00:03:27.720> down<00:03:27.930> because<00:03:28.290> there<00:03:28.440> are

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
push the triggers down because there are

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.800 
push the triggers down because there are
those<00:03:28.680> certain<00:03:29.010> guard<00:03:29.250> areas<00:03:29.700> takes<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.660> while

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
those certain guard areas takes a while

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.180 
those certain guard areas takes a while
if<00:03:30.930> you're<00:03:31.019> not<00:03:31.140> used<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.769> try<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.950> fit

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
if you're not used to it just try to fit

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.340 
if you're not used to it just try to fit
it<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.430> properly<00:03:32.880> hold<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.630> down<00:03:33.750> tight<00:03:34.079> so

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
it on properly hold it down tight so

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.509 
it on properly hold it down tight so
make<00:03:34.530> sure<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.709> fits<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.459> said

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
make sure it fits in and like I said

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.580 
make sure it fits in and like I said
push<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.360> triggers<00:03:36.720> down<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.380> get

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
push the triggers down so you can get

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350 
push the triggers down so you can get
them<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.100> certain<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.940> little<00:03:39.120> guard

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
them in that certain that little guard

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.150 
them in that certain that little guard
air<00:03:39.540> near<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.840> triggers<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.590> it'll<00:03:40.950> fit

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
air near the triggers and it'll fit

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.699 
air near the triggers and it'll fit
appropriately<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.690> push<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.109> in<00:03:43.260> make

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
appropriately and I just push it in make

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
front shell yeah let's see here with a

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.840 
front shell yeah let's see here with a
little<00:03:49.170> motor<00:03:49.470> swing<00:03:49.890> into<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.160> trigger<00:03:50.549> I

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
little motor swing into the trigger I

everything<00:04:14.760> back<00:04:15.090> together<00:04:15.450> as<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.810> can<00:04:15.870> see

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
everything back together as you can see

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.690 
everything back together as you can see
I'm<00:04:16.169> doing<00:04:16.289> here<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.250> said<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.609> are

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
I'm doing here like I said there are

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.670 
I'm doing here like I said there are
five<00:04:18.000> total<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.690> then<00:04:19.140> make<00:04:19.350> sure<00:04:19.380> everything

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
five total and then make sure everything

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.170 
five total and then make sure everything
feels<00:04:19.890> right<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.070> know<00:04:20.160> make<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.489> make<00:04:21.150> sure

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
feels right you know make this make sure

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.010 
feels right you know make this make sure
the<00:04:21.390> triggers<00:04:21.720> are<00:04:21.870> clicking<00:04:22.260> down

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
the triggers are clicking down

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.360 
the triggers are clicking down
because<00:04:23.379> that's<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:23.889> to<00:04:23.979> be<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.129> hardest

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
because that's going to be the hardest

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.100 
because that's going to be the hardest
part<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.819> messing<00:04:25.479> up<00:04:25.569> the<00:04:25.629> triggers<00:04:25.960> if

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
part is messing up the triggers if

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.290 
part is messing up the triggers if
you're<00:04:26.229> not<00:04:26.319> used<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:28.090> if<00:04:28.180> any

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
you're not used to this and if any

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.670 
you're not used to this and if any
things<00:04:28.449> go<00:04:28.629> just<00:04:28.660> want<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.050> snap<00:04:29.349> back<00:04:29.379> on

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
things go just want to snap back on

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.939 
things go just want to snap back on
these<00:04:30.160> little<00:04:30.610> handles<00:04:31.090> on<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.270> side<00:04:31.949> they're

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
these little handles on the side they're

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.499 
these little handles on the side they're
kind<00:04:33.129> of<00:04:33.159> weird<00:04:33.310> used<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.699> line<00:04:33.909> them<00:04:34.060> up<00:04:34.210> were

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
kind of weird used to line them up were

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.149 
kind of weird used to line them up were
like<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.900> little<00:04:35.110> indents<00:04:35.440> are<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.860> snap

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
like the little indents are and snap

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.529 
like the little indents are and snap
them<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.460> place<00:04:36.699> they're<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:36.970> lot<00:04:37.090> easier<00:04:37.419> to

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
them in place they're a lot easier to

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.749 
them in place they're a lot easier to
put<00:04:37.720> on<00:04:37.750> as<00:04:38.440> opposed<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.220> difficulty<00:04:39.639> they

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
put on as opposed to the difficulty they

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.909 
put on as opposed to the difficulty they
are<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.970> take<00:04:40.150> off<00:04:40.330> then<00:04:41.229> once<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.710> do<00:04:41.889> that

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
are to take off then once you do that

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.219 
are to take off then once you do that
know<00:04:42.639> just<00:04:42.940> look<00:04:43.389> around<00:04:43.509> make<00:04:43.870> sure<00:04:43.900> things

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
know just look around make sure things
