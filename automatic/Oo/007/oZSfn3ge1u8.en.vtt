hey<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.439> fizzy<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.550> to

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hey this is fizzy and this is going to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.440 
hey this is fizzy and this is going to
be<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.790> quick<00:00:03.090> explanation<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.740> new

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
be a quick explanation of how this new

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.490 
be a quick explanation of how this new
monitor<00:00:06.450> test<00:00:06.810> works<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.269> input<00:00:09.780> connects

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
monitor test works the we input connects

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.640 
monitor test works the we input connects
to<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.860> AVerMedia<00:00:11.519> live<00:00:11.730> gamer<00:00:11.790> portable

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
to the AVerMedia live gamer portable

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
to the AVerMedia live gamer portable
which<00:00:13.650> converts<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.639> component<00:00:15.240> input<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
which converts the component input to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.609 
which converts the component input to
HDMI<00:00:16.369> which<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> fed<00:00:17.820> into<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> monitor<00:00:18.630> then

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
HDMI which is fed into the monitor then

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.820 
HDMI which is fed into the monitor then
the<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.369> sound<00:00:20.760> input<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.359> connected<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.170> an

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the we sound input is connected to an

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.960 
the we sound input is connected to an
external<00:00:23.460> speaker<00:00:24.050> this<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.859> case

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
external speaker this one in this case

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.689 
external speaker this one in this case
then<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.840> device<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:29.550> actually

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
then this device here can actually

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
then this device here can actually
actually<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> has<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> microphone<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
actually it has a microphone on it and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.819 
actually it has a microphone on it and
an<00:00:32.189> LED<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> detects<00:00:34.079> sound<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.770> I'm

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
an LED and when it detects sound so I'm

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.020 
an LED and when it detects sound so I'm
going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> put<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> microphone<00:00:35.399> next<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
going to put the microphone next to the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
going to put the microphone next to the
speaker<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.170> detects<00:00:37.559> sound

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
speaker and when it it detects sound

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
speaker and when it it detects sound
it's<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.190> light<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.700> LED<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it's gonna light up this LED then I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.850 
it's gonna light up this LED then I
could<00:00:40.290> record<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> LED<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.149> screen<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
could record the LED and the screen at a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
could record the LED and the screen at a
high<00:00:44.219> FPS<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.600> calculate<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
high FPS and we can calculate the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
high FPS and we can calculate the
difference<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.160> Franck<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.879> video<00:00:48.210> frames

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
difference in Franck and video frames

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.979 
difference in Franck and video frames
between<00:00:49.410> when<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> LED<00:00:50.700> lights<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
between when the LED lights up and the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
between when the LED lights up and the
frame<00:00:52.260> we're<00:00:52.469> looking<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.039> shows<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
frame we're looking for shows up on the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
frame we're looking for shows up on the
TV<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.640> any<00:00:56.850> kind

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
TV and then we can do this with any kind

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.700 
TV and then we can do this with any kind
of<00:00:57.270> monitor<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> with

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of monitor and we can also do it with

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
of monitor and we can also do it with
composite<00:00:59.129> inputs<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.899> don't<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> use

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
composite inputs so we don't have to use

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
composite inputs so we don't have to use
a<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.590> scaler<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.280> anything<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a down scaler or anything like that to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.289 
a down scaler or anything like that to
test<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> CRT<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:05.880> compare

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
test it on a CRT so we can then compare

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.890 
test it on a CRT so we can then compare
the<00:01:06.600> lag<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.140> CRT<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> lag<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.900> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the lag of a CRT to a lag of this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.880 
the lag of a CRT to a lag of this
monitor<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.680> any<00:01:11.040> other<00:01:11.310> monitor
