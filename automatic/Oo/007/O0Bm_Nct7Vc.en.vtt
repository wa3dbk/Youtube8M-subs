completely<00:00:33.250> lost<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.580> plot<00:00:33.610> it<00:00:34.390> is<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.750> word

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
completely lost the plot it is the word

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.810 
completely lost the plot it is the word
pole<00:00:35.379> star<00:00:35.769> that<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.129> need<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.460> concentrate

pole star that you need to concentrate

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.570 
pole star that you need to concentrate
on<00:00:37.030> because<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:37.720> means<00:00:38.110> this<00:00:39.010> thing<00:00:39.340> is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
on because that means this thing is

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.450 
on because that means this thing is
absolutely<00:00:40.890> packed<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.940> goodies<00:00:44.160> most<00:00:45.160> in

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
absolutely packed with goodies most in

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.579 
absolutely packed with goodies most in
fact<00:00:45.760> I<00:00:46.180> think<00:00:46.510> pretty<00:00:46.780> much<00:00:46.870> all<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.440> which

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
fact I think pretty much all of which

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.750 
fact I think pretty much all of which
make<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.070> v60<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:50.559> rather<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.280> nice<00:00:51.430> thing

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
make the v60 really rather a nice thing

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.690 
make the v60 really rather a nice thing
to<00:00:51.790> drive

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.100 

so<00:00:59.700> what<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.390> 50<00:01:00.660> grand

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
so what do you get for your 50 grand

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
so what do you get for your 50 grand
you<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:02.300> 350<00:01:03.300> horsepower<00:01:05.000> from<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.390> tweaked

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you get 350 horsepower from a tweaked

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
you get 350 horsepower from a tweaked
turbo<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:10.280> seriously<00:01:11.280> redesigned

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
turbo you get seriously redesigned

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.810 
turbo you get seriously redesigned

sounding<00:01:15.300> dampers<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.560> actually

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
sounding dampers which are actually

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.680 
sounding dampers which are actually
adjustable<00:01:17.400> they're<00:01:17.729> analogue<00:01:18.210> backwards

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
adjustable they're analogue backwards

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.810 
adjustable they're analogue backwards
but<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.050> adjustable<00:01:19.670> manually<00:01:20.670> you've

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
but they are adjustable manually you've

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.570 
but they are adjustable manually you've
gotta<00:01:20.940> go<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:21.960> adjusted

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
gotta go to do to get them adjusted

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
gotta go to do to get them adjusted
you<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.759> uprated<00:01:24.300> brakes<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:25.080> suspension<00:01:25.259> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
you get uprated brakes the suspension is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
you get uprated brakes the suspension is
operated<00:01:26.399> you<00:01:26.550> get<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> big<00:01:27.060> wheels<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
operated you get the big wheels and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.230 
operated you get the big wheels and
tires<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.350> isn't<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.710> single<00:01:29.190> option<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
tires there isn't a single option that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
tires there isn't a single option that
you<00:01:30.330> can<00:01:30.509> specify<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.009> v60<00:01:32.460> Polestar

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you can specify on the v60 Polestar

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
you can specify on the v60 Polestar
because<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.410> just<00:01:34.649> shows<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:35.190> nice

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because that just shows a really nice

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.790 
because that just shows a really nice
level<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.360> confidence<00:01:36.929> I<00:01:37.080> think<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.560> Volvo

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
level of confidence I think from Volvo

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.180 
level of confidence I think from Volvo
they<00:01:38.340> basically<00:01:38.640> say<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> take<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:40.830> or

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
they basically say this is it take it or

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.060 
they basically say this is it take it or
leave<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.450> change<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
leave it but don't change it and you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.680 
leave it but don't change it and you
know<00:01:47.310> having<00:01:47.490> spent<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.910> bit<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.179> behind

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
know having spent a bit of time behind

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.810 
know having spent a bit of time behind
the<00:01:48.840> wheel<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.160> would<00:01:50.369> change

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the wheel I'm not sure I would change

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.210 
the wheel I'm not sure I would change
much<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.420> thing<00:01:51.660> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.679> it's<00:01:52.860> really

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
much on this thing I think it's really

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.660 
much on this thing I think it's really
really<00:01:53.580> rather<00:01:53.970> nice<00:01:54.350> it's<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:56.340> not

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
really rather nice it's it's not

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.020 
really rather nice it's it's not

absolutely rocket ship fast it weighs

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.020 
absolutely rocket ship fast it weighs
over<00:02:00.360> 1,800<00:02:01.170> kilograms<00:02:01.289> and<00:02:01.770> yes<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.220> has<00:02:02.310> 350

horsepower and a decent thump of talk to
go<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.429> it<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:05.729> you're<00:02:05.880> talking<00:02:06.209> about<00:02:06.300> kind

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
go with it but you're talking about kind

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.559 
go with it but you're talking about kind
of<00:02:07.489> performance<00:02:08.489> levels<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.000> are<00:02:09.060> somewhere

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of performance levels that are somewhere

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.680 
of performance levels that are somewhere
between<00:02:09.810> an<00:02:10.560> Audi<00:02:10.770> s4<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.150> full<00:02:12.420> house

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
between an Audi s4 and the full house

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.410 
between an Audi s4 and the full house
howdy<00:02:13.080> rs4<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.910> start<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.300> little

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
howdy rs4 and when you start a little

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.900 
howdy rs4 and when you start a little
bit<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.680> Polestar<00:02:17.250> actually

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
bit like that the Polestar actually

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.820 
bit like that the Polestar actually
starts<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.330> make<00:02:18.510> qual<00:02:18.750> or<00:02:18.900> stands

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.500 

ah

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.729 

they've<00:02:29.510> also<00:02:29.660> tweaked<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.290> gearbox

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
they've also tweaked the gearbox

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.460 
they've also tweaked the gearbox
software<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> properly<00:02:32.989> fruity

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
software and you get a properly fruity

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.699 
software and you get a properly fruity
sounding<00:02:33.830> exhaust<00:02:34.690> second<00:02:35.690> gear

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
sounding exhaust second gear

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.069 
sounding exhaust second gear
I<00:02:37.739> mean<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.519> sounds<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.659> doesn't<00:02:39.989> sound

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
I mean that sounds that doesn't sound

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.530 
I mean that sounds that doesn't sound
much<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.530> Volvo<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.129> me<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:42.090> sounds<00:02:42.359> good

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
much like a Volvo to me it sounds good

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.649 
much like a Volvo to me it sounds good
sounds<00:02:42.959> potent<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.459> kind<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.849> refined<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.480> mean

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
sounds potent but kind of refined I mean

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.740 
sounds potent but kind of refined I mean
ultimately<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:47.370> are<00:02:47.519> talking<00:02:48.000> about<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.269> proper

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
ultimately we are talking about a proper

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.080 
ultimately we are talking about a proper
cue<00:02:49.019> car<00:02:49.319> here<00:02:49.590> forget<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.640> bright<00:02:50.849> blue

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
cue car here forget the bright blue

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.119 
cue car here forget the bright blue
paintwork<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.719> this<00:02:51.840> one<00:02:52.019> one<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.620> these<00:02:52.769> in

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
paintwork of this one one of these in

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.229 
paintwork of this one one of these in
black<00:02:54.319> with<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.349> kind<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.709> stealth<00:02:56.189> 350<00:02:57.090> or

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
black with a kind of stealth 350 or

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.410 
black with a kind of stealth 350 or
avenues<00:02:57.840> right<00:02:58.139> foot<00:02:58.409> I<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:59.639> see<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> appeal

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
avenues right foot I can see the appeal

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.420 
avenues right foot I can see the appeal
I<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:01.079> can<00:03:02.120> Volvo<00:03:03.120> are<00:03:03.389> going<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.719> sell<00:03:04.430> 125

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
I really can Volvo are going to sell 125

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
I really can Volvo are going to sell 125
of<00:03:06.299> these<00:03:06.420> things<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:07.019> hope<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.159> actually

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
of these things they hope and I actually

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.129 
of these things they hope and I actually
think<00:03:08.519> they<00:03:08.670> will<00:03:08.909> forget<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.720> fact<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:09.989> I'm

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
think they will forget the fact that I'm

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.479 
think they will forget the fact that I'm
sitting<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.650> side<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.040> car<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:11.430> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
sitting on this side of the car all the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.129 
sitting on this side of the car all the
ones<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.209> come<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.599> UK<00:03:12.750> will<00:03:13.109> be

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
ones that come to the UK will be

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.740 
ones that come to the UK will be
right-hand-drive<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:15.209> they'll<00:03:15.450> all<00:03:15.569> have

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
right-hand-drive and they'll all have

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.690 
right-hand-drive and they'll all have
exactly<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.439> same<00:03:16.470> amount<00:03:16.829> of<00:03:16.980> spec<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.430> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
exactly the same amount of spec that you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.959 
exactly the same amount of spec that you
cannot<00:03:17.970> change<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.840> say<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.569> does<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.900> handle

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
cannot change as I say so does it handle

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.429 
cannot change as I say so does it handle
yeah<00:03:23.969> it<00:03:24.090> does<00:03:24.239> actually<00:03:24.419> in<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.169> slightly

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
yeah it does actually in in a slightly

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.619 
yeah it does actually in in a slightly
ham-fisted<00:03:25.829> kind<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.639> way<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.510> it's

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
ham-fisted kind of way but it's

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.770 
ham-fisted kind of way but it's
four-wheel<00:03:27.900> drive<00:03:28.489> drive<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.760> go<00:03:29.969> they<00:03:30.450> say

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
four-wheel drive drive can go they say

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.360 
four-wheel drive drive can go they say
anything<00:03:31.290> up<00:03:31.469> to<00:03:31.560> 100%<00:03:31.889> front

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
anything up to 100% front

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.909 
anything up to 100% front
hundred-percent<00:03:32.819> rear<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.439> know<00:03:34.590> it

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
hundred-percent rear but it you know it

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.240 
hundred-percent rear but it you know it
feels<00:03:36.379> it<00:03:37.379> feels<00:03:37.409> like<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.769> front-wheel<00:03:38.219> drive

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
feels it feels like a front-wheel drive

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.009 
feels it feels like a front-wheel drive
car<00:03:38.489> that's<00:03:38.969> got<00:03:39.150> an<00:03:39.209> unusual<00:03:39.540> amount<00:03:39.989> of

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
car that's got an unusual amount of

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.170 
car that's got an unusual amount of
traction

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
traction

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.929 
traction
but<00:03:41.980> okay<00:03:42.980> there's<00:03:43.189> a<00:03:43.250> bit<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.430> understeer

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
but okay there's a bit of understeer

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.459 
but okay there's a bit of understeer
when<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.239> really<00:03:44.540> start<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.900> love<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.200> about

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469 
when you really start to love it about

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.599 
when you really start to love it about
but<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:47.030> turns<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.689> well<00:03:47.870> enough<00:03:48.189> stop<00:03:49.189> really

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
but it turns in well enough stop really

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.660 
but it turns in well enough stop really
well<00:03:50.049> there<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.200> just<00:03:51.439> a<00:03:51.560> little<00:03:51.829> sniff<00:03:52.489> of

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
well there is just a little sniff of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.839 
well there is just a little sniff of
understeer<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:53.359> no<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.890> v60<00:03:55.280> Polestar

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
understeer but no the v60 Polestar

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.059 
understeer but no the v60 Polestar
handles<00:03:56.840> properly<00:03:57.829> handles<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:59.590> it<00:04:00.590> rides

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
handles properly handles and it rides

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.330 
handles properly handles and it rides
pretty<00:04:01.310> well<00:04:01.819> too<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.420> mean<00:04:03.170> they've<00:04:04.099> got<00:04:04.250> the

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
pretty well too I mean they've got the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.339 
pretty well too I mean they've got the
dampers<00:04:04.760> set<00:04:04.969> on<00:04:05.150> kind<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.599> medium<00:04:06.109> at<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
dampers set on kind of medium at the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.300 
dampers set on kind of medium at the
moment<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:09.290> can<00:04:09.379> stiffen<00:04:09.680> them<00:04:09.920> up<00:04:10.040> kind

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
moment and you can stiffen them up kind

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.509 
moment and you can stiffen them up kind
of<00:04:10.370> ten<00:04:10.609> ways<00:04:11.109> stiffer<00:04:12.109> ten<00:04:12.319> ways<00:04:12.469> softer<00:04:13.250> so

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
of ten ways stiffer ten ways softer so

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.870 
of ten ways stiffer ten ways softer so
you<00:04:14.329> can<00:04:14.450> do<00:04:14.540> what<00:04:14.659> you<00:04:14.720> want<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.349> springs

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you can do what you want the springs

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.219 
you can do what you want the springs
this<00:04:16.880> brings<00:04:17.120> at<00:04:17.269> eighty<00:04:17.449> percent<00:04:17.989> stiffer

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
this brings at eighty percent stiffer

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.409 
this brings at eighty percent stiffer
than<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.590> standard<00:04:18.979> 360<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.150> doesn't

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
than the standard 360 but that doesn't

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.580 
than the standard 360 but that doesn't
matter<00:04:20.509> because<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.870> got<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:20.989> trick<00:04:21.289> set<00:04:21.500> of

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
matter because you got a trick set of

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.010 
matter because you got a trick set of
dampers<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.160> work<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.449> much<00:04:23.780> stiffer

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
dampers to work with much stiffer

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.430 
dampers to work with much stiffer
Springs<00:04:25.240> doesn't<00:04:26.240> matter<00:04:26.360> you<00:04:26.539> know<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.750> ride

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
Springs doesn't matter you know the ride

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.260 
Springs doesn't matter you know the ride
quality<00:04:28.070> is<00:04:28.099> never<00:04:28.370> going<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.669> suffer<00:04:29.060> if

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
quality is never going to suffer if

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.670 
quality is never going to suffer if
you've<00:04:29.479> got<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.660> proper<00:04:29.960> settle<00:04:30.320> down<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
you've got a proper settle down to the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.100 
you've got a proper settle down to the
work<00:04:30.949> and<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.400> thing<00:04:31.669> has<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.240> proper<00:04:32.750> set<00:04:32.990> of

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
work and this thing has a proper set of

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.409 
work and this thing has a proper set of
dampers<00:04:33.500> I'm<00:04:34.220> not<00:04:34.460> sure<00:04:34.639> about<00:04:34.759> the<00:04:35.000> steering

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
dampers I'm not sure about the steering

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.930 
dampers I'm not sure about the steering
that<00:04:35.539> you<00:04:35.630> can<00:04:35.780> change<00:04:36.110> between<00:04:36.940> lightweight

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
that you can change between lightweight

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.939 
that you can change between lightweight
medium<00:04:38.599> weight<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.990> heavy<00:04:39.199> weight<00:04:39.380> just<00:04:39.740> give

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
medium weight and heavy weight just give

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.370 
medium weight and heavy weight just give
me<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.370> right<00:04:40.610> way<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.030> please<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.840> that's

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
me the right way to please and that's

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.210 
me the right way to please and that's
that<00:04:42.710> but<00:04:43.330> I'm<00:04:44.330> liking<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.900> v60<00:04:45.320> Polestar<00:04:45.919> a

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
that but I'm liking the v60 Polestar a

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.200 
that but I'm liking the v60 Polestar a
lot

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.840 

so<00:04:54.810> is<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.080> Polestar<00:04:55.650> really<00:04:56.010> worth<00:04:56.190> 50<00:04:56.820> grand
