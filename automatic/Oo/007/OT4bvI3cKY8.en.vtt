00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 a common disease that attacks the herd 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.470
 in the south and southeast of the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.179
 brazil also found in mato grosso 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.480
 the conclusion is part of a research 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 academic animals on farms in Sinop and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.460
 smile were monitored 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 the academic of the medical course 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.990
 veterinarian michael hardman went to the field 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 to investigate the incidence of a disease 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.210
 common in the south and southeast of the country 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.449
 but with little information in weeds 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 to bovine k- cell leukosis is a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.600
 disease that she has in Brazil and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 here in the mato grosso is not yet 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 given about the disease 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 then it is of enormous importance for the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.180
 mainly cattle people 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 milk culture and you had a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.379
 acceptance of the owners of the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.480
 farms slowly opening the gate 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 to get in and do the work is in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.100
 all the places we visited were 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 about ten properties is all 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.339
 producers have received very well the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.049
 even with some curiosity it is to know the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.689
 herd health status 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.270
 Professor Bruno Castro is the guiding 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.670
 research as the disease is a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.189
 infectious disease caused 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 by a virus from the same ice family 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.770
 infection and equine infectious anemia is 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 a disease caused by a virus in that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.530
 to be spread by the herd then by 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 account of this characteristic, people 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 sought to carry out this study here in the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.700
 state since there was no data 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 concerning this disease in the herd 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.229
 in Mato Grosso where the national data 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.590
 mainly in the southern region of the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.130
 country and region dosso the dash 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.340
 prevalence range from around 50 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.799
 reaching up to 80% of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
 bovine leukosis, the effects that the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.360
 disease can cause are innumerable to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.060
 mainly dairy herd she is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.280
 silent and affected animals 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.680
 are usually the oldest cattle 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.049
 for this reason the great incidence in cattle 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 dairy cattle since the animals of cut 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.530
 are generally slaughtered before 36 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.940
 months 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.260
 according to the results that people 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.579
 got people 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 and found that something around 11% in the 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.110
 city â€‹â€‹was 11.21 percent of the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.370
 animals were positive for the disease is 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.980
 a certain silent disease that is in the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.069
 most cases it will cause a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.319
 drop in production chrome studies 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.379
 confirm that contaminated livestock can 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.700
 have a 5 to 15% drop in production of 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.310
 milk and meat 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.620
 this property in sinop was one of the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.019
 monitored and where the material was collected 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.500
 to be analyzed in the laboratory 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.989
 at the federal university of mato grosso a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.239
 prevention to give a lot for the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.900
 routine early diagnosis within the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.790
 flock 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.769
 furthermore disposal of animals 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.739
 positive and acquisition of animals 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.079
 known negative sir had notion 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.670
 that there is this disease that never 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.099
 I had seen it roll there 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.530
 important of this study was to evaluate 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.019
 that the state of mato grosso our region 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.120
 It also presents a 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.510
 low prevalence compared to Brazil 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.690
 then efforts must be made to 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.389
 to keep this prevalence low for 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.419
 that prevents the entry of positive animals 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.769
 and the prevalence here in the herd 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.609
 You keep the animals healthy. 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.310
 up-to-date with all the vaccines inside the 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.780
 My name as an idea already has a 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.970
 experience as a producer already knows more 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.030
 or less when the cow shows the ox 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.859
 with some symptom with hundreds already comes from 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.750
 away from the everyday experience 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.389
 the day- to-day experience we are the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.919
 property veterinarian because when 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.900
 Do you see anything is not going to draw much 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.250
 People have to see first for later. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.349
 of a veterinarian 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.849
 scientific work was presented to the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.359
 medical examining bank 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.709
 ufmt veterinary surgeon in sinop approved and 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.139
 now available to the community 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.019
 for anyone who wants more information 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.540
 a diagnosis is already being made 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.540
 here at sinop at the federal university of 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.889
 mato grosso and if a producer wants to 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.109
 to evaluate what his flock seeks 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.039
 a laboratory of infectious diseases of the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.550
 ufmt sinop via email castro bg 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.940
 contact us at ufmt.br 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.920
 people 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.080
 that I and my team are we going to 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.610
 the property that was of positive you 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.220
 not only do this work for the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.080
 completion of the course but also how to 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.410
 We are already taking notice of the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.320
 animal health is enormous. 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:48.120
 importance because it is directly related 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.650
 with the production and gain of the producer 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.680
 so this is important you know the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.850
 status of the herd and what shape you can 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.850
 avoid disease 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.350
 There at the farmhouse one day I lived
