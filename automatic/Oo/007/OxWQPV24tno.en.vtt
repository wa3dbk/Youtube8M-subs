know everyone's eyebrows are a little

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.420 
know everyone's eyebrows are a little
different<00:05:06.170> so<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.620> sort<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.890> impossible<00:05:07.130> to

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
different so it sort of impossible to

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.500

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
fuller like the brush itself so it tends

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.970
