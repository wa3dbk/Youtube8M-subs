Pathfinder but at the same time it has

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.650 
Pathfinder but at the same time it has
more<00:01:20.870> interior<00:01:21.470> space<00:01:22.360> there's<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.390> lot<00:01:23.540> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.109 

we<00:01:37.350> focused<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> ease<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.850> ingress

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
we focused a lot on the ease of ingress
egress<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.140> made<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> door<00:01:40.590> openings<00:01:40.979> a

egress so we made the door openings a
lot<00:01:41.250> bigger<00:01:41.490> getting<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.270> second<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
lot bigger getting into the second and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.330 
lot bigger getting into the second and
third<00:01:42.840> rows<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.289> easier<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.069> child

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
