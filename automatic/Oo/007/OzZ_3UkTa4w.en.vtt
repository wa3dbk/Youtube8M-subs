herringbone pattern very fast very easy
to<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.340> okay<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.659> our<00:01:42.810> loop

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
to do okay so now that we have our loop

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810 
to do okay so now that we have our loop
start<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> largest<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.250> work<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.640> way

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
start with the largest and work your way

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
start with the largest and work your way

up a little bit of hot glue just in the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
up a little bit of hot glue just in the
center<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.700> needed<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.450> now

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
center is all that's needed and now

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
center is all that's needed and now
you're<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.259> overlapping<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.100> about

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you're going to be overlapping is about

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
you're going to be overlapping is about
50%<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> glue<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
50% you can put the glue right on the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.920 
50% you can put the glue right on the
ribbon<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> back<00:01:54.689> of

ribbon or you can put it on the back of
the<00:01:54.990> ribbon<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.320> make<00:01:55.649> sure<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.159> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

so keep that in mind we're just gonna

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.350 
so keep that in mind we're just gonna
make<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.470> trunk<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.520> can<00:02:35.670> put<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:35.910> trunk<00:02:36.209> on

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
make a trunk you can put this trunk on

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.020 
make a trunk you can put this trunk on
after<00:02:36.840> or<00:02:37.080> before<00:02:37.620> either<00:02:37.920> way<00:02:38.250> take<00:02:38.850> your

then just lay it at the very bottom and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.290 
then just lay it at the very bottom and
glue<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.250> short<00:02:44.640> trunk<00:02:45.000> or

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
way

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.790 
way
slide<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.570> up<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:48.840> slide<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.080> down<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.440> just

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
slide it up or slide it down and just

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.350 
slide it up or slide it down and just
hot<00:02:49.980> glue<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> goes<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> back<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.269> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
hot glue it it goes on the back so you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.210 
hot glue it it goes on the back so you
won't<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.680> start<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
won't see it you can start with that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.070 
won't see it you can start with that
first<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.000> I'll<00:02:54.090> show<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.300> how<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
first and I'll show you how to do that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.720 
first and I'll show you how to do that
if<00:02:55.290> you'd<00:02:55.470> rather<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.220> doesn't<00:02:56.519> show

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
if you'd rather so it doesn't show

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.690 
if you'd rather so it doesn't show
either<00:02:57.030> way<00:02:57.239> works<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.870> then<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:59.220> are<00:02:59.459> ready

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
either way works and then you are ready

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.479 
either way works and then you are ready
to<00:02:59.910> add<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.239> embellishment<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.230> using

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
to add your embellishment I like using

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.680 
to add your embellishment I like using
e6000<00:03:02.489> for<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> embellishments<00:03:03.330> they<00:03:03.450> seem

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
e6000 for the embellishments they seem

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.390 
e6000 for the embellishments they seem
to<00:03:03.810> stay<00:03:04.019> on<00:03:04.140> better<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.739> doesn't<00:03:05.100> get<00:03:05.160> so

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
to stay on better and it doesn't get so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.300 
to stay on better and it doesn't get so
