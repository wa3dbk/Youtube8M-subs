that was milk and crackers and I'm gonna

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.080 
that was milk and crackers and I'm gonna
give<00:00:45.560> her<00:00:45.770> some<00:00:45.800> scrambled<00:00:46.490> eggs<00:00:46.760> and

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
give her some scrambled eggs and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.970 
give her some scrambled eggs and
applesauce<00:00:47.630> and<00:00:47.990> some<00:00:49.870> leg<00:00:50.870> mash<00:00:51.170> mixed<00:00:51.800> in

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
applesauce and some leg mash mixed in

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.570 
applesauce and some leg mash mixed in
because<00:00:52.670> she's<00:00:52.850> an<00:00:53.030> adult<00:00:53.330> chicken<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.580> the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
because she's an adult chicken and the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.310 
because she's an adult chicken and the
main<00:00:55.730> thing<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.120> guess<00:00:56.330> is<00:00:56.570> that<00:00:56.750> you<00:00:56.989> have<00:00:57.170> to

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
main thing I guess is that you have to

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.910 
main thing I guess is that you have to
keep<00:00:57.500> their<00:00:57.770> head<00:00:58.010> tipped<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.780> straight<00:01:00.200> way

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
keep their head tipped in a straight way

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.370 
keep their head tipped in a straight way
and<00:01:01.340> I<00:01:02.180> usually<00:01:02.480> do<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.720> just<00:01:02.960> by<00:01:03.080> kind<00:01:03.260> of

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
and I usually do that just by kind of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.680 
and I usually do that just by kind of
holding<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.950> feathers<00:01:04.280> on<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.729> side

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
holding on to the feathers on the side

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.820 
holding on to the feathers on the side
of<00:01:05.870> her<00:01:05.960> head<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.290> wants<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.590> tip<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:08.830> they

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
of her head that wants to tip and they

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.890 
of her head that wants to tip and they
tend<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.100> fall<00:01:10.310> asleep<00:01:10.460> when<00:01:11.450> they're<00:01:11.600> eating

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
tend to fall asleep when they're eating

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.900 
tend to fall asleep when they're eating
so<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.009> kind<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.250> wake<00:01:13.400> them<00:01:13.580> up<00:01:13.729> or

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
so you have to kind of wake them up or

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.770 
so you have to kind of wake them up or
let<00:01:14.090> them<00:01:14.210> take<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.390> little<00:01:14.660> snooze<00:01:14.960> between

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
let them take a little snooze between

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.310 
let them take a little snooze between
sessions<00:01:17.780> here<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:20.270> takes<00:01:20.479> about<00:01:20.630> ten<00:01:20.990> minutes

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
sessions here it takes about ten minutes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.120 
sessions here it takes about ten minutes
for<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:23.350> make<00:01:24.350> sure<00:01:24.380> they've<00:01:24.710> had<00:01:25.009> enough

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
for you to make sure they've had enough

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.069 
for you to make sure they've had enough
and<00:01:25.520> my<00:01:25.580> feet<00:01:25.790> are<00:01:25.820> about<00:01:26.150> four<00:01:26.390> times<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.750> day

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.380 

and<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.710> like<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.039> use<00:01:34.100> applesauce<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.149> milk

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
and I like to use applesauce and milk

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.300 
and I like to use applesauce and milk
because<00:01:35.869> she<00:01:36.380> doesn't<00:01:36.590> drink<00:01:36.890> well<00:01:37.159> by

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
because she doesn't drink well by

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.240 
because she doesn't drink well by
herself<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.590> don't<00:01:39.619> want<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.009> use<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
herself and I don't want to use the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.830 
herself and I don't want to use the
eyedropper<00:01:40.700> because<00:01:41.030> she<00:01:41.149> can<00:01:41.299> aspirate<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
eyedropper because she can aspirate the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.139 
eyedropper because she can aspirate the
liquid<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:42.679> I<00:01:42.920> would<00:01:43.490> rather<00:01:43.640> put<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.909> liquid

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
liquid so I would rather put the liquid

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.639 
liquid so I would rather put the liquid
in<00:01:44.390> her<00:01:44.479> food<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:45.740> she's<00:01:45.950> going<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:46.369> sleep

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.940 

sometimes<00:01:51.649> I<00:01:51.770> wake<00:01:51.920> her<00:01:52.069> up<00:01:52.100> by<00:01:52.310> blowing<00:01:52.549> on<00:01:52.819> it

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
sometimes I wake her up by blowing on it

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.279 
sometimes I wake her up by blowing on it
seems<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.159> work<00:01:55.479> but<00:01:56.479> eventually<00:01:56.929> she'll<00:01:57.110> just

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
seems to work but eventually she'll just

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.590 
seems to work but eventually she'll just
get<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:57.619> sleepy<00:01:57.860> she<00:01:58.159> won't<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.459> able<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.789> stay

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
get so sleepy she won't be able to stay

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.850 
get so sleepy she won't be able to stay
awake<00:02:04.899> sometimes<00:02:05.899> it's<00:02:06.259> recommended<00:02:06.829> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
awake sometimes it's recommended that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.880 
awake sometimes it's recommended that
you<00:02:07.159> use<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.569> poly<00:02:09.789> liquid<00:02:11.590> vitamins<00:02:12.590> for

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
you use the poly liquid vitamins for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.309 
you use the poly liquid vitamins for
babies<00:02:13.280> poly<00:02:13.790> vice<00:02:14.060> all<00:02:14.329> I<00:02:14.569> think<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:14.930> called

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
babies poly vice all I think it's called

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.520 
babies poly vice all I think it's called
but<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.810> put<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.019> their<00:02:18.110> mouth<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
but if you put that in their mouth with

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.050 
but if you put that in their mouth with
the<00:02:18.620> dropper<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.099> she<00:02:19.220> aspirates<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.910> she

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
the dropper and she aspirates that she

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.949 
the dropper and she aspirates that she
could<00:02:20.209> get<00:02:20.299> pneumonia<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:23.299> I<00:02:23.329> feel<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.750> it's

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
could get pneumonia so I feel like it's

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.600 
could get pneumonia so I feel like it's
if<00:02:24.200> they're<00:02:24.380> eating<00:02:24.680> well<00:02:24.860> high<00:02:25.220> protein

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
if they're eating well high protein

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.850 
if they're eating well high protein
foods<00:02:25.910> she'll<00:02:26.239> come<00:02:26.989> out<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.530> two<00:02:27.709> or

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
foods she'll come out of it in two or

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.430 
foods she'll come out of it in two or
three<00:02:28.130> weeks
