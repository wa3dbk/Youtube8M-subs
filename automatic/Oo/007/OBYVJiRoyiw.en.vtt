00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.140
 We 're the ones with the worst daniela staff. 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.880
 given the angel of samsung 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.269
 She'll get us as floating. 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.030
 the sancho system works and it has 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.099
 Specific features of the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.810
 payment card and can simulate a 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.730
 something magnetic all companies do not 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.660
 do something interesting 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 It's there for us. 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.870
 well then right here 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.530
 we have an application called johnny 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.530
 skin 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 the registration of your business cards 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.329
 flags 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.329
 it's a house bug, right? 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.110
 It is in the environment where you spent Sunday in 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.990
 a series of at 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.310
 here in this case speak 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.470
 so I like customer hello and select the 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.120
 product I want to find a value 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.130
 of five hundred and ninety and not at the moment 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.790
 think of this man I can do 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.000
 both with nfc technology and together with 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.520
 approximation here that the magnetic field 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.890
 so I 'm going to pay first 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.470
 stimulating nfc technology 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.120
 so I need it already for fear of 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:30.910
 biometrics is the yes of fans authorize ice 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.170
 payment and approaching the cnsp reader 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.310
 I can do it 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.070
 is the following schedule 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.840
 It's the agent 's that the proof on that trail 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.460
 a presentation is over I can 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.759
 important role for this 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.759
 presentation 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.310
 the speed of the captain says it was 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:59.970
 well on tape 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.970
 the other so old option is square 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.430
 magnetic stripe using the device will 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.200
 make a common magnetic card that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.060
 people used it here I think this is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.730
 the big difference from the suspect 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.130
 this is it can be it can be used 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.130
 in 90% of the current machines 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.880
 Miguel selecting the problem again 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.090
 They think I 'm a dog. 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:42.590
 I can 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.590
 They think we had a story with 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.240
 rock borges your car 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.940
 reach the end concluding 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.239
 the system is raining and there is one 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.950
 specific company to do this 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 technology for the magnetic actually 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:14.080
 I already have technology in the American market. 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.760
 also magnetic card 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.569
 in Brazil we use the card a lot 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.569
 has xingu 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.980
 this company called lucy fair was 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.319
 contracted by samsung 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.360
 then I will vote in the rose section can 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.860
 This scope also then 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.440
 the unipÃª 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.380
 Then you fix laundromat the tenants. 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.990
 still were not 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.160
 She worked with her on the market. 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.890
 Brazilian 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.450
 we're already moving pretty hectic 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.760
 beautiful night 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:55.550
 he is an ax but he really is 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.220
 it is good, it follows your greater comprehension of the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:03.820
 cause of other united states 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:08.120
 especially those who do not have the highest rate 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:12.129
 I found the show the coach 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.129
 we'll tell you more about the show of 10
