there's a homework assignment if you
will<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.460> home<00:01:50.909> activity<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.020> parents

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
will a home activity that the parents

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
will a home activity that the parents
can<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.890> involved<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.689> it<00:01:54.689> once<00:01:54.930> you've

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
can get involved in this it once you've

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
can get involved in this it once you've
set<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> goal<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.770> also<00:01:55.920> talk<00:01:56.250> about<00:01:56.280> measuring

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
set a goal we also talk about measuring

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
set a goal we also talk about measuring
your<00:01:57.030> progress<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.689> how<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> students

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
your progress so how do the students

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
your progress so how do the students
understand<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.149> are<00:02:00.180> getting<00:02:00.570> closer

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
understand that they are getting closer

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.770 
understand that they are getting closer
and<00:02:01.110> closer<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.740> realize<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.759> their<00:02:02.939> dream<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and closer to realize in their dream of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.490 
and closer to realize in their dream of
succeeding<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.070> goal<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.259> talk

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
succeeding and a goal and so we talk

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.279 
succeeding and a goal and so we talk
about<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.220> kids<00:02:08.520> talking<00:02:08.819> about

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
about that and get kids talking about

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.410 
about that and get kids talking about
we<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.099> making<00:02:10.549> a<00:02:10.729> goal<00:02:10.909> won't<00:02:11.299> be<00:02:11.390> a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
we know that making a goal won't be a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.050 
we know that making a goal won't be a
straight<00:02:11.750> line<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.200> its<00:02:13.159> completion<00:02:13.609> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
straight line to its completion that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.009 
straight line to its completion that
they're<00:02:14.209> going<00:02:14.329> to<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.480> some<00:02:14.689> interruptions

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
they're going to be some interruptions

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.559 
they're going to be some interruptions
or<00:02:15.620> some<00:02:15.859> problems<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.909> we<00:02:17.000> talked<00:02:17.180> about<00:02:17.329> it

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
or some problems so we talked about it

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.089 
or some problems so we talked about it
what<00:02:17.989> our<00:02:18.109> roadblocks<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.799> how<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:18.950> you

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
what our roadblocks and how do you

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.610 
what our roadblocks and how do you
minimize<00:02:19.250> excuses<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.359> and<00:02:21.140> what<00:02:21.379> kind<00:02:21.590> of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
minimize excuses and and what kind of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.020 
minimize excuses and and what kind of
setbacks<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.730> look<00:02:22.969> out<00:02:23.120> for<00:02:24.640> once<00:02:25.640> we've<00:02:25.849> done

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
setbacks to look out for once we've done

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.530 
setbacks to look out for once we've done
that<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.329> start<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.840> get<00:02:26.989> into<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.939> ten<00:02:28.939> key

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
that we start to get into the ten key

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.729 
that we start to get into the ten key
points<00:02:30.079> of<00:02:30.939> goal<00:02:31.939> setting<00:02:32.200> where<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.349> use<00:02:33.560> them

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
points of goal setting where to use them

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.470 
points of goal setting where to use them
which<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:33.920> right<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.489> school<00:02:34.819> right<00:02:35.269> in

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
which is right here in school right in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.550 
which is right here in school right in
this<00:02:35.599> classroom<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.379> how'd<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.459> get<00:02:37.609> started

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
this classroom and how'd it get started

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.199 
this classroom and how'd it get started
we<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.709> time<00:02:40.010> management<00:02:40.250> section<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
we have a time management section in the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.420 
we have a time management section in the
book<00:02:41.389> so<00:02:41.629> that<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:42.109> students<00:02:42.950> understand

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
book so that the students understand

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.000 
book so that the students understand
that<00:02:44.060> there<00:02:44.569> really<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.930> some<00:02:45.319> extra<00:02:45.620> time<00:02:45.799> to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
that there really is some extra time to

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.770 
that there really is some extra time to
do<00:02:46.129> that<00:02:46.310> extra<00:02:46.700> 20<00:02:47.000> minutes<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.419> homework<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
do that extra 20 minutes of homework a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.800 
do that extra 20 minutes of homework a
night<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:49.579> get<00:02:49.819> them<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.329> see<00:02:50.569> that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
night and but we get them to see that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.559 
night and but we get them to see that
not<00:02:51.169> us<00:02:51.439> dictating<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.459> them<00:02:52.669> and<00:02:52.909> they<00:02:53.299> start

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
not us dictating to them and they start

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.699 
not us dictating to them and they start
to<00:02:53.659> see<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.989> they're<00:02:54.139> wasting<00:02:54.500> some<00:02:54.680> time

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
to see that they're wasting some time

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.830 
to see that they're wasting some time
and<00:02:55.129> they<00:02:55.430> could<00:02:55.609> find<00:02:55.819> that<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.269> there's

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and they could find that and there's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.740 
and they could find that and there's
also<00:02:57.019> an<00:02:57.260> educational<00:02:57.919> contract<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.669> hope<00:02:59.510> this

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
also an educational contract I hope this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.589 
also an educational contract I hope this
brief<00:03:00.400> look<00:03:01.400> video<00:03:01.879> will<00:03:02.090> give<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.359> chance

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
is a very easy to implement but it's a

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.240
