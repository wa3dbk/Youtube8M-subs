00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.580
 rock 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.610
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.680
 this is the revelation of the second version 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.850
 of the magic of the cube that dwells in only 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.849
 two seconds 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.630
 if you do not laugh at the revelation of the first 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.689
 version 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.990
 I'll leave it up here and then 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.920
 You come back in this video to see 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.910
 the second version then in the first 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.780
 version 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.530
 I showed you with you and you. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.700
 it simply turned the cube that 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.470
 normal car but this is not cool right 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.350
 the first version is not very good that 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.570
 you only show the face of the cube 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.750
 first the front 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.670
 the second version is a bit better than 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.140
 you will show the cube completely 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.460
 dismounted and how are you going to do this? 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.820
 You'll have to do it here. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.850
 Botafogo is the game that turned to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 ahead you will do and this movement 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 here o 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.689
 the right part you will spin in the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.369
 counterclockwise 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.960
 here too and require it in the sense 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.460
 counterclockwise the knife and the front 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.909
 you will also generate in the sense 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.429
 then rotates counterclockwise and clockwise 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.490
 part of the left will also generate in the 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.729
 counterclockwise counterclockwise 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.639
 watch right here 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.819
 the top wants green for you not 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:49.569
 if you curl up then you will have 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:52.959
 the cube giving the illusion that it is 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.659
 completely shuffled thinking that the 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.920
 the front is orange and the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.020
 green is up 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.179
 so when you show the cube 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.479
 completely disassembled for people 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.759
 You already start looking for the part of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.729
 up and the front while 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.730
 talk to them well and make a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.340
 movement you will generate the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.260
 from left clockwise 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.590
 the front part clockwise 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.129
 and the right-hand part clockwise 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.110
 to end the scrambling then 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:33.269
 You come here, the whirlwind, and there you 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.680
 come to this part here to hide the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.950
 game that assembles the cube 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.690
 that way so making a quick go 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.040
 stay like this let's use green as 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:53.459
 example of new right completely 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.000
 shuffle person you see this move 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.000
 on here 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:06.329
 the last part of the year at the same time 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.069
 cover a better effect and then you have the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:14.519
 body completely assemble show 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:18.000
 five personnel there was revelation of the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.959
 second version of the cube's magic in 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.959
 only two seconds 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 it is important at the time to change your mind 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 the teaching part 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.550
 The goal opened the front door 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.090
 It's an area but in my car so you 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.850
 they saw here the right anti-clockwise front 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.230
 anti left schedule play 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.540
 If you want to go to the public and 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.560
 try to solve 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.010
 as opposed to re -voting the fear 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.800
 why not a feline some again and 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.840
 you will pack the producer will not 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.720
 able to mount again to 1 which requires 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.989
 death and money this offer in 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.080
 box awaits its due place 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:31.350
 so it's the serious tip well the top 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:36.020
 and ahead in you and at the time that is 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.020
 just a move the idea 

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:48.889
 that's reissuing the text 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.469
 If you liked the video, do not forget about it. 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.439

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:58.219

 They challenged and finished and the partners

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.990
 no clues to the snippet is normal to 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.339
 magic of dwarfism I do not even go 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.240
 make it clear here O 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:35.689
 the channel in ecology on the other 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.749
 canal maggi wanted and down there 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.430
