00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 One thing I can not stand anymore 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.179
 just a few more pages today I'm reading 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.269
 without paying attention 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.269
 The only incentive here is already ending. 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.450
 the eike awakening is the debut book of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.700
 author lisa mcmann americana and some 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 awards that this book but nothing that a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.590
 little advertising does not and is a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 book for the twilight generation to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 main character a weird germina 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 average beauty badly loved by the mother 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.680
 Prince Charming is here. 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.530
 play with all the patience of the world 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.039
 I would do anything for her 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.570
 as if the story existed about 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:07.350
 to gm she has a gift that is to enter the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 people's dream but not on purpose 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.420
 just be close to a person who is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.700
 dreaming and she finally plays for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 inside the dream 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.759
 without any choice and she will have to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.939
 live with this drama throughout the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.490
 book and throughout the series you see is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.060
 the first in a series already has a few more 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.790
 three books ahead is a book so 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.280
 for a little girl that sometimes we do not 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.799
 can not even understand the dialogue of the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.610
 characters in this book is a series of 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.070
 codes and gestures that the gm and the friends 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 they know but I did not do the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.299
 Less idea and maybe you from home 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.390
 probably will not know too 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.149
 that are not explained and then you get the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.250
 God, I want you to say that it is 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.409
 What are you talking about and I do not know. 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.740
 I really do not know what she is 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.990
 speaking in some cases and also has a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.129
 little of the skill of the height 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.730
 a little clarity in the text 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.540
 especially in games to define until 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.180
 Who 's talking? 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.909
 sometimes we do not know what 's good 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.739
 It's the fall of the yen that's talking here. 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.189
 Do you want to answer who asked? 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.530
 we do not always know why games 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.790
 are not so important so some 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.640
 cases 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.310
 then it is not obvious neither by the context 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.980
 nor by the way she wrote 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.519
 although this title arouses him to me 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 caused it was sleep so excuse me for 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.439
 please click 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.439
 I liked it and signed up for the next channel
