lot of our colors anymore contain pearls
and<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.860> gets<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.190> be<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.340> real<00:04:40.610> treat<00:04:41.180> when

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
and so it gets to be a real treat when

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.110 
and so it gets to be a real treat when
it<00:04:41.510> goes<00:04:41.659> to<00:04:41.690> time<00:04:42.620> come<00:04:43.070> time<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.340> match<00:04:43.699> paint

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
it goes to time come time to match paint

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.379 
it goes to time come time to match paint
this<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.199> our<00:04:45.380> virtual<00:04:45.770> spray<00:04:46.190> unit<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:46.880> what

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
this is our virtual spray unit and what

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.839 
this is our virtual spray unit and what
it<00:04:47.510> does<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:48.199> simulate<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:49.039> spraying<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.669> a

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
it does to simulate the spraying of a

true spray gun through a videogame you

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.040 
true spray gun through a videogame you
might<00:04:53.659> say<00:04:54.130> basically<00:04:55.130> give<00:04:55.789> us<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:56.180> score<00:04:56.659> and

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
might say basically give us a score and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.469 
might say basically give us a score and
also<00:04:57.560> analyze<00:04:58.190> how<00:04:58.490> well<00:04:58.729> we<00:04:58.970> did<00:04:59.120> with<00:04:59.360> the

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
also analyze how well we did with the

a good banker or a different part that

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:28.760 
a good banker or a different part that
would<00:05:25.429> be<00:05:26.429> a<00:05:26.729> real<00:05:27.089> world<00:05:27.449> you<00:05:27.839> know<00:05:28.020> situation
