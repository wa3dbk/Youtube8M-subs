 inch does not lose any quality under all 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.880
 Angles 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 while on the previous generation 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.800
 we actually lost when the ipod 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.020
 changed direction and I'm going right now 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.350
 you compare it in outline with 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.610
 an iphone 4s that size him nothing 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.620
 to see since currently I only have 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.300
 4th May 5th still not arrived 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.640
 then you find four rows 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.760
 of icons on iphone 4s with a screen 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.490
 of 3.5 inches and 5 rows of icons on 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.290
 4 inch screen the quality the screen 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.500
 of this ipod touch is really sublime 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.680
 beautiful all you want is 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.730
 grand 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.770
 I want to tell you that seeing the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.300
 difference in thickness between the iphone 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.550
 4 and the fifth ipod touch 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.230
 generation it's really obvious 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.900
 the ipod touch is really small 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.670
 super end is really super light there 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.590
 find of course the difference of the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.000
 lightning collector at connector 30 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.470
 pins to finish I'm going to you 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.850
 compare this ipod touch of fifth 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.070
 generation and the ipod touch of first 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.990
 generation and we can see that the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.520
 difference in size between 2007 and 2012 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.290
 is not that big and that the ipod 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.690
 touch is really keeping a finesse 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.430
 very very big so that's what we 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.140
 could say on this new ipod touch of 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.060
 fifth generation that is really 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.250
 successful for me it's the best ipod 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.140
 touch since 2007 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.500
 saint-light super beautiful a very design 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.260
 pretty and especially a beautiful screen this 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.660
 ipod touch exists in 32 and 64 10k and 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.880
