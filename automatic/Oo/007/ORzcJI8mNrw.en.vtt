backwards and we wanted to go forwards

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.859 
backwards and we wanted to go forwards
going<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.150> when<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.570> them<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> go

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
going right when you want them to go

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.240 
going right when you want them to go
forwards<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.560> left<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.159> them

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to go forwards going backwards when you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
to go forwards going backwards when you
want<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.770> frustrating<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
want to go right it's frustrating it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.310 
want to go right it's frustrating it
made<00:01:35.640> more<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> fact<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.200> other

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
made more so by the fact that at other

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
made more so by the fact that at other
times<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.100> won't<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> those<00:01:38.820> problems<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
times you won't have those problems and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.569 
times you won't have those problems and
that<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.170> inherent<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.920> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> control

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that is inherent in this kind of control

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.850 
that is inherent in this kind of control
scheme<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.090> saw<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> before<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.290> old

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
scheme we saw it before if you're old

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
scheme we saw it before if you're old
enough<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.220> me<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.880> play<00:01:45.119> games<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
enough like me to have play games like

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
enough like me to have play games like
flug<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> brothers<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:46.890> other<00:01:47.009> games

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
flug and brothers and some other games

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.880 
flug and brothers and some other games
where<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.049> times<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.649> end

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
where you do you know at times you end

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.499 
where you do you know at times you end
up<00:01:50.040> controlling<00:01:50.369> both<00:01:50.640> characters<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.270> just

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
up controlling both characters it's just

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.530 
up controlling both characters it's just
it<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.369> frustrating<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it can be really really frustrating and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.539 
it can be really really frustrating and
you<00:01:54.600> add<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> those<00:01:55.619> issues<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.310> fact

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you add to those issues the very fact

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.889 
you add to those issues the very fact
that<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.850> times<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.149> get<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> idea<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> game

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that at times you get the idea the game

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.600 
that at times you get the idea the game
is<00:01:58.020> fucking<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.590> random<00:01:59.040> jumps<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is fucking with you random jumps that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160 
is fucking with you random jumps that
should<00:01:59.790> be<00:01:59.909> easy<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.299> failed<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> kept

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
should be easy just failed and I kept

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.899 
should be easy just failed and I kept
expecting<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.860> dev<00:02:02.130> laugh<00:02:02.369> track<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> start

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
expecting a dev laugh track to start

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
expecting a dev laugh track to start
when<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> went<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:03.750> somewhat<00:02:04.500> adequate<00:02:05.130> on

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
when I went from somewhat adequate on

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
when I went from somewhat adequate on
the<00:02:05.549> overall<00:02:05.790> platforming<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> complete<00:02:06.840> bum

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the overall platforming to complete bum

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.160 
the overall platforming to complete bum
tart<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.590> 20

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
tart with like 20

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.199 
tart with like 20
in<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> row<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.490> think<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.729> lot<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.060> had

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
in a row and I think a lot of this had

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.370 
in a row and I think a lot of this had
to<00:02:10.240> do<00:02:10.390> with<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.630> fact<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.990> you're<00:02:11.170> using

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
to do with the fact that you're using

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.960 
to do with the fact that you're using
both<00:02:11.650> thumbsticks<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.400> both<00:02:12.520> triggers<00:02:12.760> at

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
both thumbsticks and both triggers at

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.550 
both thumbsticks and both triggers at
the<00:02:13.060> same<00:02:13.239> time<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.569> no<00:02:13.599> aiming<00:02:14.080> convention

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
the same time with no aiming convention

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.170 
the same time with no aiming convention
for<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.800> jumps<00:02:15.099> but<00:02:15.250> other<00:02:15.459> places<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.910> Auto

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
for the jumps but other places have Auto

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.089 
for the jumps but other places have Auto
jumping<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.140> seems<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.440> bit<00:02:17.560> rough<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.010> if

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
jumping so it seems a bit rough and if

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.800 
jumping so it seems a bit rough and if
you<00:02:18.190> have<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> low<00:02:18.550> level<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.940> frustration<00:02:19.150> or<00:02:19.780> a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
you have a low level of frustration or a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.150 
you have a low level of frustration or a
Christian<00:02:20.319> Bale<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.620> should<00:02:20.770> probably<00:02:20.920> stay

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
Christian Bale you should probably stay

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.970 
Christian Bale you should probably stay
away<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.720> devs<00:02:22.959> when<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.620> comes<00:02:23.800> to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
away from that the devs when it comes to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.470
