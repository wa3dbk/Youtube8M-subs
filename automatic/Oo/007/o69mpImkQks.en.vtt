00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
to be pretty consistent rhythm because I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.949 
to be pretty consistent rhythm because I
had<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.280> relaxed<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.090> if<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> body<00:02:31.690> was

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
had to be relaxed and if the body was

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.840 
had to be relaxed and if the body was
stiff<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.470> tense<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:33.340> wasn't<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.760> to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
stiff and tense it wasn't going to

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.280 
stiff and tense it wasn't going to
perform<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.420> function<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:34.989> had<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> have

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
perform and function so I had to have

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.320 
perform and function so I had to have
this<00:02:35.500> rhythm<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> had<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.459> be<00:02:36.580> loose<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
this rhythm so I had to be loose and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.259 
this rhythm so I had to be loose and
relaxed<00:02:38.200> desire<00:02:39.100> because<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.819> batsman<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.209> a

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
relaxed desire because the batsman is a
