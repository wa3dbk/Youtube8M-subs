well<00:00:05.150> one<00:00:05.480> thing<00:00:05.690> that<00:00:05.840> I<00:00:05.870> think<00:00:05.990> is<00:00:06.260> really

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
well one thing that I think is really

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.840 
well one thing that I think is really
great<00:00:07.880> about<00:00:08.029> this<00:00:08.600> concerto<00:00:09.290> is<00:00:09.530> that<00:00:10.010> it

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
great about this concerto is that it

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.570 
great about this concerto is that it
just<00:00:11.510> has<00:00:11.690> a<00:00:11.900> little<00:00:12.230> bit<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.379> everything<00:00:13.010> it

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
just has a little bit of everything it

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.000 
just has a little bit of everything it
people<00:00:14.449> think<00:00:14.780> of<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.049> Tchaikovsky<00:00:15.410> as<00:00:15.709> being

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
people think of the Tchaikovsky as being

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.019 
people think of the Tchaikovsky as being
this<00:00:16.250> big<00:00:17.150> powerful<00:00:17.960> almost<00:00:19.029> bombastic

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
this big powerful almost bombastic

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.960 
this big powerful almost bombastic
virtuosic<00:00:20.929> showpiece<00:00:21.650> but<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.730> starts<00:00:23.300> off<00:00:23.570> so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
virtuosic showpiece but it starts off so

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.419 
virtuosic showpiece but it starts off so
gently<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:26.929> just<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:27.470> unassuming<00:00:27.890> I

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
gently and it's just so unassuming I

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.819 
gently and it's just so unassuming I
think<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.499> the<00:00:30.499> orchestral<00:00:31.249> opening<00:00:31.999> is

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
think that the the orchestral opening is

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.560 
think that the the orchestral opening is
so<00:00:33.829> gentle<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.430> would<00:00:34.550> never<00:00:34.730> know<00:00:35.000> where

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
so gentle you would never know where

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.229 
so gentle you would never know where
it's<00:00:35.840> going<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.500> then<00:00:37.460> when<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:38.000> does

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
it's going and then when it does

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.970 
it's going and then when it does
introduce<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.260> first<00:00:39.620> theme<00:00:40.610> in<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.270> strings

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
introduce the first theme in the strings

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.619 
introduce the first theme in the strings
if<00:00:42.980> there's<00:00:43.300> almost<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.570> kind<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:45.109> a<00:00:45.230> dark

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
if there's almost a kind of a dark

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.479 
if there's almost a kind of a dark
undercurrent<00:00:47.629> there<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:48.350> when<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.980> solo

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
undercurrent there that when the solo

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.490 
undercurrent there that when the solo
violin<00:00:49.940> enters<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.269> few<00:00:50.539> measures<00:00:50.870> later<00:00:51.079> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
violin enters a few measures later and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.889 
violin enters a few measures later and
states<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.070> theme<00:00:52.489> is<00:00:52.940> completely<00:00:53.420> gone<00:00:53.600> or

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
states that theme is completely gone or

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.580 
states that theme is completely gone or
back<00:00:54.079> into<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:54.699> beautiful<00:00:56.079> pastoral<00:00:57.079> type

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
back into this beautiful pastoral type

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.009 
back into this beautiful pastoral type
of<00:00:57.800> world<00:00:58.519> doesn't<00:00:59.090> last<00:00:59.239> for<00:00:59.539> long<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.899> gets

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
of world doesn't last for long it gets

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.200 
of world doesn't last for long it gets
exciting<00:01:00.949> pretty<00:01:01.190> fast<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.730> do<00:01:01.820> think<00:01:02.089> that

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
exciting pretty fast but I do think that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.939 
exciting pretty fast but I do think that
the<00:01:02.359> opening<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.750> very<00:01:03.019> special<00:01:03.559> for<00:01:03.589> such<00:01:03.920> a

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
the opening is very special for such a

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.430 
the opening is very special for such a
big<00:01:04.250> piece<00:01:04.840> it's<00:01:05.840> quite<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.170> short

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
big piece it's quite a short

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:26.530 
big piece it's quite a short
introduction<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:08.510> orchestra<00:01:09.050> begins<00:01:09.590> on

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.370 

so<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.440> first<00:01:28.830> theme<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:30.380> introduced

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so then this first theme is introduced

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.510 
so then this first theme is introduced
in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> violins<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.180> somewhat<00:01:34.140> dark

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
in the violins but it's somewhat dark

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.840 
in the violins but it's somewhat dark

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the first violent entrance I think is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.930 
the first violent entrance I think is
just<00:01:48.060> wonderful<00:01:48.660> is<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.560> comes<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.640> out

just wonderful is it it comes right out
from<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.960> orchestra<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.430> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
from the orchestra and to this this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.740 
from the orchestra and to this this
brief<00:01:54.330> cadenza<00:01:55.050> following<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.010> violin

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
brief cadenza following which the violin

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.170 
brief cadenza following which the violin
restates<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.229> theme<00:01:58.650> but<00:01:59.190> in<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.850> such<00:02:00.150> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
restates that theme but in just such a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.410

of<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.980> writing<00:03:59.370> was<00:03:59.760> very<00:04:00.350> unusual<00:04:01.350> for<00:04:01.800> its

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
of the writing was very unusual for its

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.280 
of the writing was very unusual for its
time<00:04:02.459> there's<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.850> wonderful<00:04:03.330> spot<00:04:03.750> happens

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
time there's a wonderful spot happens

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.920 
time there's a wonderful spot happens
twice<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.250> first<00:04:05.430> moment<00:04:05.910> where<00:04:06.269> this

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
twice in the first moment where this

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.800 
twice in the first moment where this
triplet<00:04:07.319> type<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.220> figuration<00:04:08.910> he<00:04:09.630> gets

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
triplet type of figuration he gets

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.500 
triplet type of figuration he gets
working<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:10.800> double<00:04:11.160> stops<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.940> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
working in double stops and it's a I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.470 
working in double stops and it's a I
think<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.530> any<00:04:13.890> young<00:04:14.550> violinist<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.300> one<00:04:15.420> of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
think to any young violinist it's one of

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.000 
think to any young violinist it's one of
those<00:04:15.569> famous<00:04:16.049> passages<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.799> first

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
those famous passages that the first

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.099 
those famous passages that the first
time<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.310> hear<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.639> just<00:04:17.760> think<00:04:18.030> wow<00:04:18.359> that's

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
time you hear you just think wow that's

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.310 
time you hear you just think wow that's
great<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.590> want<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.859> learn<00:04:19.950> how<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.160> do<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
great I want to learn how to do that

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:32.820

I always thought that was such a neat
part<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:41.610> movement<00:04:42.180> continues<00:04:42.690> with<00:04:43.610> sort<00:04:44.610> of

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
part the movement continues with sort of

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.270 
part the movement continues with sort of
a<00:04:44.760> variation<00:04:45.210> upon<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.350> themes<00:04:46.860> that<00:04:47.130> were

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
a variation upon the themes that were

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.120 
a variation upon the themes that were
introduced<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.750> builds<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.740> large

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
introduced and then builds to a large

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.700 
introduced and then builds to a large
central<00:04:51.030> cadenza<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.910> is<00:04:54.200> was<00:04:55.200> written<00:04:55.410> by

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
central cadenza that is was written by

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.560 
central cadenza that is was written by
Tchaikovsky<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.670> it's<00:04:56.880> not<00:04:57.000> one<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.270> those

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
Tchaikovsky so it's not one of those

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.070 
Tchaikovsky so it's not one of those
cadenzas<00:04:58.560> where<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.830> composer<00:04:59.190> left<00:04:59.640> it<00:05:00.080> to

you might want to it was written by

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.400 
you might want to it was written by
Tchaikovsky<00:05:05.670> and<00:05:06.060> it's<00:05:06.180> it's<00:05:06.720> very<00:05:07.050> effective

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410

and as sort of a central place in the
movement<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:13.430> couple<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.520> very<00:05:14.700> interesting

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
movement a couple of very interesting

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.440 
movement a couple of very interesting
effects<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.460> my<00:05:17.850> favorites<00:05:18.270> with<00:05:18.420> a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
effects one of my favorites with a

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:26.210 
effects one of my favorites with a
so-called<00:05:19.200> left<00:05:19.470> hand<00:05:19.800> staccato<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:25.220> think

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
so-called left hand staccato I think

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.990 
so-called left hand staccato I think
that's<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.460> very<00:05:26.580> neat<00:05:26.820> effect<00:05:28.100> moving<00:05:29.100> into

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
that's a very neat effect moving into

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.500 
that's a very neat effect moving into
the<00:05:30.830> episode<00:05:31.830> after<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.400> cadenza<00:05:32.700> we<00:05:33.150> have<00:05:33.480> a

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
the episode after the cadenza we have a

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.770 
the episode after the cadenza we have a
very<00:05:33.990> beautiful<00:05:34.880> recap<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.510> original

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
very beautiful recap of that original

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.810 
very beautiful recap of that original
theme<00:05:37.290> where<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:38.100> is<00:05:38.190> actually<00:05:38.490> played<00:05:38.640> by<00:05:38.670> the

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
theme where it is actually played by the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.270 
theme where it is actually played by the
flute<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.300> there's<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.110> variation<00:05:40.410> upon<00:05:40.920> it<00:05:41.100> in

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
flute and there's a variation upon it in

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.470 
flute and there's a variation upon it in
the<00:05:41.610> violin<00:05:42.090> and<00:05:43.070> we<00:05:44.150> basically<00:05:45.150> move<00:05:45.300> through

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
the violin and we basically move through

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.810 
the violin and we basically move through
the<00:05:45.630> same<00:05:46.110> material<00:05:46.710> that<00:05:46.920> was<00:05:47.040> presented<00:05:47.400> in

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
the same material that was presented in

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.660 
the same material that was presented in
the<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.660> first<00:05:48.930> bit<00:05:49.230> of<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.590> movement<00:05:50.040> with<00:05:50.310> a

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
the the first bit of the movement with a

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.510 
the the first bit of the movement with a
few<00:05:51.060> extra<00:05:51.420> variations<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.290> then<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:53.280> all

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
few extra variations and then it all

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.380 
few extra variations and then it all
builds<00:05:54.060> into<00:05:54.300> an<00:05:55.020> incredibly<00:05:55.670> exciting<00:05:56.670> coda

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
builds into an incredibly exciting coda

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.310 
builds into an incredibly exciting coda
where<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.230> violin<00:05:58.650> is<00:05:58.770> flying<00:05:59.130> all<00:05:59.460> over<00:05:59.490> the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
where the violin is flying all over the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.140 
where the violin is flying all over the
orchestra<00:06:01.320> is<00:06:01.440> blaring<00:06:01.860> away<00:06:02.190> I<00:06:02.220> think<00:06:02.580> it's<00:06:02.880> a

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
orchestra is blaring away I think it's a

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.290 
orchestra is blaring away I think it's a
it's<00:06:03.450> a<00:06:03.810> really<00:06:03.990> an<00:06:04.260> exciting<00:06:05.190> bit<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.180> the

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
it's a really an exciting bit of the

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.730 
it's a really an exciting bit of the
piece<00:06:06.510> where<00:06:08.300> it<00:06:09.300> quite<00:06:09.750> often<00:06:09.960> audiences

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
piece where it quite often audiences

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.940 
piece where it quite often audiences
will<00:06:11.030> well<00:06:12.030> think<00:06:12.270> that<00:06:12.450> the<00:06:12.690> such<00:06:13.500> a<00:06:13.530> big

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
will well think that the such a big

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.860 
will well think that the such a big
finale<00:06:14.250> must<00:06:14.640> actually<00:06:15.000> be<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.480> end<00:06:15.660> of<00:06:15.780> the

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
finale must actually be the end of the

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.990 
finale must actually be the end of the
entire<00:06:16.110> concerto<00:06:16.740> when<00:06:16.890> people<00:06:17.160> will<00:06:17.820> clap

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
entire concerto when people will clap

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.540 
entire concerto when people will clap
and<00:06:18.560> sometimes<00:06:19.560> I've<00:06:19.740> seen<00:06:20.160> people<00:06:20.430> actually

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
and sometimes I've seen people actually

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.990 
and sometimes I've seen people actually
start<00:06:20.910> walking<00:06:21.270> to<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:21.570> exits<00:06:21.930> but

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
start walking to the exits but

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.110 
start walking to the exits but
thankfully<00:06:24.000> there<00:06:24.240> is<00:06:24.510> quite<00:06:25.260> a<00:06:25.290> bit<00:06:25.530> more

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
thankfully there is quite a bit more

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.160 
thankfully there is quite a bit more
including<00:06:27.120> it<00:06:27.270> that<00:06:27.630> well<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:27.930> beautiful

including it that well the beautiful

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.680 
including it that well the beautiful
