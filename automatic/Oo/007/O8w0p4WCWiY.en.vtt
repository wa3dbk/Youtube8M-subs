so<00:00:03.220> attention<00:00:03.340> deficit<00:00:04.120> hyperactivity

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
so attention deficit hyperactivity

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.950 
so attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder<00:00:05.020> is<00:00:05.529> a<00:00:05.590> very<00:00:05.980> misunderstood

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
disorder is a very misunderstood

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.120 
disorder is a very misunderstood
psychiatric<00:00:07.960> disorder<00:00:08.410> it's<00:00:09.340> real<00:00:09.870> it

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
psychiatric disorder it's real it

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.919 
psychiatric disorder it's real it
literally<00:00:12.130> five<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:12.849> eight<00:00:13.090> percent<00:00:13.389> of<00:00:13.900> the

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
literally five to eight percent of the

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.679 
literally five to eight percent of the
population<00:00:14.139> has<00:00:14.860> this<00:00:15.099> disorder<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.209> the

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
population has this disorder and the

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.290 
population has this disorder and the
important<00:00:17.110> part<00:00:17.259> is<00:00:17.560> that<00:00:18.070> it's<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:18.730> variation

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
important part is that it's a variation

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.650 
important part is that it's a variation
on<00:00:19.359> normal<00:00:19.810> so<00:00:20.440> you<00:00:21.010> have<00:00:21.279> children<00:00:22.119> who<00:00:22.630> are

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
on normal so you have children who are

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.259 
on normal so you have children who are
more<00:00:23.470> hyperactive<00:00:23.800> more<00:00:24.400> impulsive<00:00:24.699> more

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
more hyperactive more impulsive more

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.019 
more hyperactive more impulsive more
inattentive<00:00:26.019> than<00:00:26.560> other<00:00:26.920> children<00:00:27.460> their

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
inattentive than other children their

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
inattentive than other children their
developmental<00:00:28.689> age<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.670> lifetime

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
developmental age and it is a lifetime

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.350 
developmental age and it is a lifetime
disorder<00:00:32.470> so<00:00:32.980> that<00:00:33.400> it<00:00:33.790> will<00:00:33.940> look<00:00:34.090> slightly

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
disorder so that it will look slightly

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.420 
disorder so that it will look slightly
different<00:00:34.710> obviously<00:00:35.710> between<00:00:35.980> a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
different obviously between a

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.569 
different obviously between a
preschooler<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.620> school-age<00:00:38.620> child<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.370> high

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
preschooler a school-age child a high

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.630 
preschooler a school-age child a high
school<00:00:39.850> student<00:00:40.059> or<00:00:40.329> an<00:00:41.140> adult<00:00:41.469> but<00:00:41.739> there's

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
school student or an adult but there's

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.180 
school student or an adult but there's
still<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.910> consistency<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:44.190> inattention

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
still a consistency of inattention

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.279 
still a consistency of inattention
impulsivity<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.910> hyperactivity<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.899> in

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
impulsivity and hyperactivity and in

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.770 
impulsivity and hyperactivity and in
fact<00:00:47.500> most<00:00:48.039> often<00:00:48.489> we<00:00:49.450> see<00:00:49.629> that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
fact most often we see that

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.500 
fact most often we see that
hyperactivity<00:00:50.230> disappears<00:00:50.950> as<00:00:51.360> someone<00:00:52.360> gets

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
hyperactivity disappears as someone gets

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.660 
hyperactivity disappears as someone gets
older<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.020> so<00:00:53.590> when<00:00:54.160> they're<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.399> their<00:00:54.640> late

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
older and so when they're in their late

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.479 
older and so when they're in their late
adolescence<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.600> early<00:00:55.690> adulthood<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
adolescence and early adulthood that

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.360 
adolescence and early adulthood that
symptom<00:00:57.940> seems<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.360> go<00:00:58.449> away<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.899> if<00:00:59.469> we<00:00:59.680> are

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
symptom seems to go away and if we are

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.880 
symptom seems to go away and if we are
able<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.969> look<00:01:01.149> at<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.359> brains<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.899> children

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
able to look at the brains of children

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.170 
able to look at the brains of children
who<00:01:03.100> have<00:01:03.399> ADHD<00:01:04.770> they<00:01:05.770> look<00:01:06.009> different<00:01:06.549> than

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
who have ADHD they look different than

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.590 
who have ADHD they look different than
typical<00:01:08.369> children<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:10.150> fact<00:01:10.360> an

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
typical children and in fact an

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.140 
typical children and in fact an
important<00:01:11.080> study<00:01:11.260> was<00:01:11.530> done<00:01:11.740> about<00:01:12.280> 15<00:01:12.880> years

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
important study was done about 15 years

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.350 
important study was done about 15 years
ago<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.570> followed<00:01:14.409> kids<00:01:14.740> over<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.220> decade<00:01:15.760> who

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
ago that followed kids over a decade who

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.149 
ago that followed kids over a decade who
had<00:01:16.659> attention<00:01:17.110> deficit<00:01:17.650> hyperactivity

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
had attention deficit hyperactivity

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.060 
had attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.720> these<00:01:19.990> were<00:01:20.170> children<00:01:20.500> who<00:01:20.710> had

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
disorder and these were children who had

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.190 
disorder and these were children who had
never<00:01:21.369> taken<00:01:21.610> medication<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.720> was<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> group

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
never taken medication this was a group

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.140 
never taken medication this was a group
of<00:01:23.350> kids<00:01:23.650> who<00:01:23.799> met<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.520> diagnostic<00:01:25.119> criteria

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
of kids who met the diagnostic criteria

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.570 
of kids who met the diagnostic criteria
were<00:01:25.810> studied<00:01:26.290> at<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.799> National<00:01:27.220> Institute

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
were studied at the National Institute

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.090 
were studied at the National Institute
of<00:01:27.640> Mental<00:01:27.700> Health<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.530> had<00:01:29.530> parents<00:01:29.979> who

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
of Mental Health and had parents who

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.640 
of Mental Health and had parents who
said<00:01:30.400> under<00:01:30.970> no<00:01:31.119> circumstances<00:01:31.900> will<00:01:32.110> we

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
said under no circumstances will we

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.940 
said under no circumstances will we
treat<00:01:33.100> our<00:01:33.250> kids<00:01:33.549> with<00:01:34.299> Ritalin<00:01:35.229> or<00:01:35.350> any<00:01:35.560> kind

treat our kids with Ritalin or any kind
of<00:01:36.250> medication<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.360> were<00:01:37.780> compared<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.409> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
of medication and were compared to a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.120 
of medication and were compared to a
group<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:39.100> typical<00:01:39.880> or<00:01:40.060> normal<00:01:40.799> children<00:01:41.799> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
group of typical or normal children the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.130 
group of typical or normal children the
same<00:01:42.369> age<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.880> they<00:01:42.939> found<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.840> there<00:01:44.049> were

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
same age and they found that there were

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.810 
same age and they found that there were
significant<00:01:44.650> differences<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.430> frontal

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
significant differences in the frontal

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.630 
significant differences in the frontal

functioning<00:01:51.040> where<00:01:51.820> you're<00:01:52.060> able<00:01:52.240> to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
functioning where you're able to

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.710 
functioning where you're able to
prioritize<00:01:53.829> which<00:01:54.340> items<00:01:55.000> should<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.299> attack

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
prioritize which items should I attack

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.899 
prioritize which items should I attack
first<00:01:56.049> what's<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.950> important<00:01:57.369> things<00:01:57.549> that<00:01:57.640> I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
first what's the important things that I

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.940 
first what's the important things that I
should<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.210> today<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.780> how<00:01:59.320> do<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.500> get<00:01:59.590> that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
should do today and how do I get that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.370 
should do today and how do I get that
done<00:02:00.310> before<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:00.850> go<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.270> item<00:02:01.630> two<00:02:01.840> three<00:02:02.110> four

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
done before I go to item two three four

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.840 
done before I go to item two three four
and<00:02:02.500> five<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:03.340> are<00:02:04.259> tackling<00:02:05.259> me<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:06.460> far<00:02:06.759> as

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
and five that are tackling me as far as

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.150 
and five that are tackling me as far as
my<00:02:06.969> daily<00:02:07.299> tasks<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.440> cerebellum<00:02:09.040> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
my daily tasks and the cerebellum is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.699 
my daily tasks and the cerebellum is
where<00:02:09.399> coordination<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.319> it's<00:02:11.470> really

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
where coordination is and so it's really

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.430 
where coordination is and so it's really
interesting<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.640> these<00:02:13.150> kids<00:02:13.690> got<00:02:14.379> older

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
interesting that as these kids got older

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.380 
interesting that as these kids got older
and<00:02:15.069> hit<00:02:15.250> adolescence<00:02:15.489> they're<00:02:16.090> Sarah

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and hit adolescence they're Sarah

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.630 
and hit adolescence they're Sarah
Belem<00:02:16.780> started<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.560> look<00:02:17.740> more<00:02:17.770> like<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.430> same

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
Belem started to look more like the same

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.840 
Belem started to look more like the same
size<00:02:18.910> as<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.450> typical<00:02:19.870> normal<00:02:20.200> kids<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.920> it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
size as the typical normal kids and it

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.320 
size as the typical normal kids and it
would<00:02:22.060> explain<00:02:22.450> why<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.069> hyperactivity

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
would explain why the hyperactivity

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840 
would explain why the hyperactivity
symptom<00:02:25.330> seems<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.810> diminish<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.709> yet<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
symptom seems to diminish and yet the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.530 
symptom seems to diminish and yet the
frontal<00:02:28.240> lobes<00:02:28.450> still<00:02:29.050> seemed<00:02:29.459> significantly

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
frontal lobes still seemed significantly

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.790 
frontal lobes still seemed significantly
smaller<00:02:31.540> than<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.980> typical<00:02:33.160> normal<00:02:33.580> child

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.320 

so<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.460> think<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:37.760> important<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.180> us<00:02:38.270> to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
so I think it's important for us to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.440 
so I think it's important for us to
realize<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.990> our<00:02:39.170> brains<00:02:39.470> are<00:02:39.830> filled<00:02:40.130> with

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
realize that our brains are filled with

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.210 
realize that our brains are filled with
neurotransmitters<00:02:41.560> these<00:02:42.560> are<00:02:42.770> brain

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
neurotransmitters these are brain

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.550 
neurotransmitters these are brain
chemicals<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.270> move<00:02:44.780> from<00:02:44.960> one<00:02:45.170> part<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
chemicals that move from one part of the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.010 
chemicals that move from one part of the
brain<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.920> another<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.460> take<00:02:47.180> messages<00:02:47.810> with

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
brain to another and take messages with

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.500 
brain to another and take messages with
them<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.680> three<00:02:48.950> big<00:02:49.510> neurotransmitters

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
them the three big neurotransmitters

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.930 
them the three big neurotransmitters
would<00:02:50.990> be<00:02:51.110> dopamine<00:02:51.680> norepinephrine<00:02:52.190> and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
would be dopamine norepinephrine and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.810 
would be dopamine norepinephrine and
serotonin<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:54.280> when<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.520> attention

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
that you become an attentive or you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.280 
that you become an attentive or you

that are smaller on these patients who

that are smaller on these patients who
have<00:03:19.040> ADHD<00:03:19.490> seem<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.390> be<00:03:20.510> very<00:03:20.690> rich<00:03:20.960> in

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
have ADHD seem to be very rich in

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.400 
have ADHD seem to be very rich in
dopamine<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:23.030> norepinephrine<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.230> it's

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
dopamine and in norepinephrine so it's

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.890 
dopamine and in norepinephrine so it's
very<00:03:24.740> nice<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.040> there's<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.900> neuroanatomical

very nice that there's a neuroanatomical
reason<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:28.040> us<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.940> be<00:03:29.840> sure<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
chemicals that we're talking about are

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.250 
chemicals that we're talking about are
equal<00:03:32.540> now<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.780> can't<00:03:33.200> take<00:03:33.500> dopamine<00:03:34.160> or

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
equal now you can't take dopamine or

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.350 
equal now you can't take dopamine or
norepinephrine<00:03:36.260> or<00:03:36.770> even<00:03:36.980> serotonin<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.790> get

norepinephrine or even serotonin and get

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.510 
norepinephrine or even serotonin and get
it<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:39.080> your<00:03:39.230> brain<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:39.920> there's

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
it to your brain because there's

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.340 
it to your brain because there's

something in our body called the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.440 
something in our body called the
blood-brain<00:03:42.770> barrier<00:03:42.970> protects<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.240> brain

blood-brain barrier protects the brain

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.350 
blood-brain barrier protects the brain
and<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.780> spinal<00:03:44.900> cord<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.650> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
and the spinal cord and the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.310 
and the spinal cord and the
neurotransmitters<00:03:47.360> those<00:03:47.540> brain<00:03:47.810> chemicals

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
neurotransmitters those brain chemicals

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.050 
neurotransmitters those brain chemicals
that<00:03:48.500> move<00:03:48.680> back<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.160> forth<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.610> that<00:03:49.640> space

that move back and forth in that space

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.570 
that move back and forth in that space
and<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:50.959> give<00:03:51.520> medications<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:53.120> kind<00:03:53.930> of

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and so we give medications that kind of

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.420 
and so we give medications that kind of
change<00:03:55.580> or<00:03:56.540> trick<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.170> brain<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.190> we

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
change or trick the brain so that we

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.050 
change or trick the brain so that we
allow<00:03:59.000> dopamine<00:03:59.810> or<00:04:00.050> norepinephrine<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.700> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
allow dopamine or norepinephrine in the
