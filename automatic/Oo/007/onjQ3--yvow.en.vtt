so that's the flagship that's the 70 to
200<00:00:57.750> F<00:00:58.140> 2.8<00:00:58.829> l<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.520> -<00:00:59.910> USM<00:01:00.840> telephoto<00:01:01.440> zoom<00:01:01.680> lens

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
200 F 2.8 l is - USM telephoto zoom lens

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.690 
200 F 2.8 l is - USM telephoto zoom lens
then<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.750> come<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> 2.8

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
then you come down in the in the 2.8

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.109 
then you come down in the in the 2.8
range<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.659> still<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.530> EF<00:01:08.520> 70<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
range and you still have the EF 70 to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.550 
range and you still have the EF 70 to
200<00:01:09.299> F<00:01:09.689> 2.8<00:01:10.320> l<00:01:10.670> USM<00:01:11.670> telephoto<00:01:12.299> lens<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.869> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
200 F 2.8 l USM telephoto lens and so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.140 
200 F 2.8 l USM telephoto lens and so
that's<00:01:13.770> another<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.820> basically

the same lens with no is motor l glass
pretty<00:01:18.659> much<00:01:18.780> same<00:01:19.020> optics<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:20.159> one

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pretty much same optics it is one

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
pretty much same optics it is one
thousand<00:01:21.240> three<00:01:21.509> hundred<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.840> seventy<00:01:22.380> six

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
get is the image stabilization now image

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
get is the image stabilization now image
stabilization<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> whole<00:01:47.670> other<00:01:47.939> video

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
stabilization can be a whole other video

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.810 
stabilization can be a whole other video
post<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> lot<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> people<00:01:49.890> have

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
post because a lot of people have

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.639 
post because a lot of people have
problems<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.750> realizing<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
problems with it not realizing that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.789 
problems with it not realizing that
image<00:01:53.100> stabilization<00:01:53.520> only<00:01:54.329> studies<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
image stabilization only studies you the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.429 
image stabilization only studies you the
shooter<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.820> subjects<00:01:57.270> moving<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:58.259> not

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
shooter if your subjects moving it's not

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.929 
shooter if your subjects moving it's not
going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> compensate<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.909> you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
going to compensate for that so you

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to compensate for that so you
still<00:02:00.240> need<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> high<00:02:00.630> enough<00:02:00.899> shutter<00:02:01.619> speed

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

something you have to decide on your own
based<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.560> shoot<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.450> if<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.810> are

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
based on what you shoot and if you are

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.740 
based on what you shoot and if you are
okay<00:02:23.530> with<00:02:23.560> using<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.190> tripod<00:02:24.460> or<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.150> monopod

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
okay with using a tripod or a monopod

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.810 
okay with using a tripod or a monopod
because<00:02:26.500> those<00:02:26.740> will<00:02:26.980> very<00:02:27.610> easily

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
because those will very easily

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.710 
because those will very easily
compensate<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.570> is

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
compensate for the is the is is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.970 
compensate for the is the is is
convenient<00:02:32.080> because<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.470> walk<00:02:32.680> around

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
convenient because you can walk around

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.220 
convenient because you can walk around
without<00:02:33.190> one<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.090> other<00:02:34.210> hand<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.990> is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
without one on the other hand the is is

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.820 
without one on the other hand the is is
also<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.530> little<00:02:35.740> heavier<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:37.440> that's<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.560> heavy

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
also a little heavier and that's a heavy

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.250 
also a little heavier and that's a heavy
lens<00:02:39.040> anyways<00:02:39.640> even<00:02:39.670> without<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.660> so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
lens anyways even without the is so

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.670 
lens anyways even without the is so
you're<00:02:41.950> probably<00:02:42.160> going<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.550> find<00:02:42.820> that

you're probably going to find that

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.250 
you're probably going to find that
hand-holding<00:02:44.710> with<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> big<00:02:45.940> bonus

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
hand-holding with the is is a big bonus

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.720 
hand-holding with the is is a big bonus
however<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.740> save<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> thousand<00:02:48.580> bucks

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
however you can save a thousand bucks

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.570 
however you can save a thousand bucks
almost<00:02:49.210> half<00:02:49.360> price<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.930> go<00:02:50.680> with<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> non<00:02:51.160> is

almost half price and go with the non is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.600 
almost half price and go with the non is
and<00:02:51.850> get<00:02:52.180> into<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.900> tripod<00:02:53.560> or<00:02:53.590> monopod<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.430> help

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
and get into a tripod or monopod to help

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.570 
and get into a tripod or monopod to help
you<00:02:54.730> out<00:02:54.820> in<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.000> situation<00:02:55.770> next<00:02:56.770> up<00:02:57.040> we

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
you out in that situation next up we

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.570 
you out in that situation next up we
have<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.170> 70<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.260> 200<00:02:59.640> f/4l<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.780> usm<00:03:01.810> lens<00:03:02.710> so

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
have the 70 to 200 f/4l is usm lens so

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280 
have the 70 to 200 f/4l is usm lens so
basically<00:03:03.940> what<00:03:04.150> we're<00:03:04.300> looking<00:03:04.570> at<00:03:04.660> there<00:03:05.140> is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
basically what we're looking at there is

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.070 
basically what we're looking at there is
the<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:07.180> twelve<00:03:07.570> hundred<00:03:07.780> eighty<00:03:07.990> one

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
the it's twelve hundred eighty one

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.030 
the it's twelve hundred eighty one
dollars<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.530> thousand<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.220> 81<00:03:09.610> US<00:03:10.030> dollars<00:03:10.480> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
dollars a thousand to 81 US dollars and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.030 
dollars a thousand to 81 US dollars and
so<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.490> a<00:03:12.880> smaller<00:03:13.510> lighter<00:03:14.260> version<00:03:15.010> of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so this is a smaller lighter version of

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.410 
so this is a smaller lighter version of
the<00:03:15.640> f<00:03:15.760> 2.8<00:03:16.570> l<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:17.290> lens<00:03:17.620> now<00:03:18.460> one<00:03:19.240> of<00:03:19.330> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
the f 2.8 l is lens now one of the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.790 
the f 2.8 l is lens now one of the
beauties<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.840> this<00:03:20.080> lens<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> lot<00:03:20.770> of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
beauties of this lens but a lot of

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.170 
beauties of this lens but a lot of
people<00:03:20.950> found<00:03:21.280> out<00:03:21.400> after<00:03:21.670> they<00:03:21.790> after<00:03:22.000> they

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
people found out after they after they

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.880 
people found out after they after they
this<00:03:22.600> lens<00:03:22.810> came<00:03:23.020> out<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.230> they<00:03:23.290> bought<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.710> i

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
this lens came out and they bought it i

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.580 
this lens came out and they bought it i
owned<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.670> lens<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:25.360> fantastic<00:03:25.590> this

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
owned this lens and it's fantastic this

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.000 
owned this lens and it's fantastic this
lens<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.100> actually<00:03:27.390> sharper<00:03:28.390> than<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:29.200> f<00:03:29.320> 2.8

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
lens is actually sharper than the f 2.8

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.630 
lens is actually sharper than the f 2.8
l<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.700> lens<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.800> basically<00:03:32.800> it's<00:03:33.100> easier<00:03:33.520> to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
l is lens and basically it's easier to

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.840 
l is lens and basically it's easier to
make<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:34.570> little<00:03:35.170> bit<00:03:35.350> slower<00:03:35.650> optics<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.430> f4

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
make a little bit slower optics the f4

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.140 
make a little bit slower optics the f4
as<00:03:37.090> opposed<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.810> f<00:03:37.930> 2.8<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:39.220> it's<00:03:39.820> easier

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
as opposed to the f 2.8 so it's easier

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.790 
as opposed to the f 2.8 so it's easier
to<00:03:40.210> make<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:40.870> make<00:03:40.990> them<00:03:41.140> more<00:03:41.260> precise

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
to make them and make them more precise

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.790 
to make them and make them more precise
so<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:42.760> lens<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.240> f4<00:03:43.780> version<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.320> tack

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
so this lens this f4 version is tack

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.540 
so this lens this f4 version is tack
sharp<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.440> lighter<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> lot<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.400> people

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
sharp and lighter so a lot of people

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.370 
sharp and lighter so a lot of people
have<00:03:48.820> actually<00:03:48.970> opted<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.020> with<00:03:50.260> the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
have actually opted for this with the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.740 
have actually opted for this with the
better<00:03:50.590> high<00:03:50.860> ISO<00:03:51.400> abilities<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.270> our<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:52.630> our

for price I went with it price was a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.540 
for price I went with it price was a
factor<00:03:59.320> although<00:03:59.680> if<00:03:59.800> I<00:03:59.860> really<00:04:00.220> wanted<00:04:00.430> the
