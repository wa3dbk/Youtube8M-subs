panel this very simple to use amplifier

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880 
panel this very simple to use amplifier
and<00:00:24.540> then<00:00:24.960> check<00:00:25.200> out<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.710> sounds

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890

and then check out some of the sounds
you<00:00:26.100> can<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.640> first<00:00:27.600> up<00:00:27.870> going<00:00:28.140> left

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
you can get from it first up going left

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.470 
you can get from it first up going left
to<00:00:28.620> right<00:00:28.830> you've<00:00:29.250> got<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.610> volume<00:00:29.820> control
