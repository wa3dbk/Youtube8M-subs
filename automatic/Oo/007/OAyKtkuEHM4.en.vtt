00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.770 
and I don't know what the fuck they did
but<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:07.889> know<00:06:08.010> it<00:06:08.880> wasn't<00:06:09.060> moving<00:06:09.450> like<00:06:09.599> this

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
but I know it wasn't moving like this

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.240 
but I know it wasn't moving like this
when<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.020> gave<00:06:10.260> it<00:06:10.440> to<00:06:10.470> him<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:10.889> that's<00:06:11.070> without

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
when I gave it to him and that's without

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.820 
when I gave it to him and that's without
the<00:06:11.400> internal<00:06:12.060> parts<00:06:12.330> back<00:06:12.539> here<00:06:12.810> oh<00:06:13.020> yeah<00:06:13.650> you

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
parts so what I probably do is get

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.469 
parts so what I probably do is get
