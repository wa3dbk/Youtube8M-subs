aren't<00:00:41.760> taken<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.180> fast<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.140> impose

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
aren't taken out fast so this impose

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
aren't taken out fast so this impose
definitely<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.460> helpful<00:00:44.850> alright

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
definitely going to be helpful alright

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
definitely going to be helpful alright
so<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.020> who<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> cover<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so the first who I want to cover are a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.400 
so the first who I want to cover are a
little<00:00:47.520> obvious<00:00:47.789> too<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:49.079> lethal

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
little obvious too but any lethal

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
little obvious too but any lethal
equipment<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.100> launcher<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> lot<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
equipment or launcher can do a lot of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.139 
equipment or launcher can do a lot of
damage<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.199> GRS<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.550> launchers<00:00:53.940> dish

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
damage to a GRS all the launchers dish

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
damage to a GRS all the launchers dish
out<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> same<00:00:54.960> amount<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.350> damage<00:00:55.710> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
out about the same amount of damage so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680 
out about the same amount of damage so
use<00:00:56.340> whatever<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> available<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
use whatever you have available to you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
use whatever you have available to you
as<00:00:58.289> far<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> Lethe<00:00:59.070> let's<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.940> are

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
as far as the Lethe let's go they are

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.990 
as far as the Lethe let's go they are
all<00:01:00.390> pretty<00:01:00.690> effective<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.710> c4<00:01:02.370> packs<00:01:02.699> more

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
all pretty effective but a c4 packs more

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.990 
all pretty effective but a c4 packs more
damage<00:01:03.420> than<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> rest<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> let's<00:01:05.640> move<00:01:05.820> on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
damage than the rest but let's move on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300 
damage than the rest but let's move on
to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> lesser-known<00:01:06.720> powerhouses<00:01:07.560> against

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to the lesser-known powerhouses against

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.100 
to the lesser-known powerhouses against
the<00:01:08.460> AGR<00:01:08.820> first<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.470> KSG<00:01:10.979> shotgun<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the AGR first off the KSG shotgun is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
the AGR first off the KSG shotgun is
amazing<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.350> taking<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> GRS<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.640> usually

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
amazing at taking out a GRS I usually

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
amazing at taking out a GRS I usually
wouldn't<00:01:15.540> recommend<00:01:16.049> any<00:01:16.290> gun<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.920> head-on

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
wouldn't recommend any gun to go head-on

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.600 
wouldn't recommend any gun to go head-on
with<00:01:17.490> an<00:01:17.610> AGR<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:20.070> takes<00:01:20.369> just

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
with an AGR but both this it takes just

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
with an AGR but both this it takes just
three<00:01:20.939> shots<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.420> close<00:01:21.479> range<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
three shots from close range now the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.289 
three shots from close range now the
farther<00:01:23.159> away<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.909> might<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
farther away you are you might need a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
farther away you are you might need a
couple<00:01:24.420> extra<00:01:24.840> shots<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.799> by<00:01:26.009> far<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
couple extra shots but it's by far the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
couple extra shots but it's by far the
best<00:01:26.729> gun<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.210> getting<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> job<00:01:27.869> done<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
best gun for getting the job done and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
best gun for getting the job done and
the<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.100> gun<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> take<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> massive

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the other gun is going to take a massive

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
the other gun is going to take a massive
amount<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.960> bullets<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.500> multiple<00:01:32.100> magazines

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
amount of bullets and multiple magazines

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.850 
amount of bullets and multiple magazines
to<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.320> only<00:01:34.409> gun<00:01:34.680> I'd

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to do it so this is the only gun I'd

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
to do it so this is the only gun I'd
suggest<00:01:35.390> all<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.509> let's<00:01:36.720> move<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> some

happen<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> miss<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> bolt<00:01:50.159> stick<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.820> might

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
happen to miss a bolt stick you might

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.730 
happen to miss a bolt stick you might
need<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.390> add<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> couple<00:01:51.810> bullets<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.380> it'll

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
need to add a couple bullets but it'll

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.649 
need to add a couple bullets but it'll
go<00:01:52.890> down<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.640> quick<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:53.880> an<00:01:54.119> enemy<00:01:54.299> would

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
go down just as quick as an enemy would

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.170 
go down just as quick as an enemy would
and<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.649> ballistic<00:01:56.189> knife<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and the ballistic knife can be one of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.709 
and the ballistic knife can be one of
the<00:01:57.360> fast<00:01:57.689> displays<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.950> four<00:01:59.340> shots<00:01:59.790> but

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the fast displays just four shots but

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.719 
the fast displays just four shots but
that<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.530> hard<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> land<00:02:02.040> without<00:02:02.219> missing

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that can be hard to land without missing

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
that can be hard to land without missing
a<00:02:02.820> shot<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> without<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.049> killing<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.439> first

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
a shot and without it killing you first

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
a shot and without it killing you first
so<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.299> clean<00:02:06.540> shot<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so if you get a good clean shot I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
so if you get a good clean shot I
suggest<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.340> shots<00:02:08.580> off<00:02:08.819> as

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
suggest you get all your shots off as

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.809 
suggest you get all your shots off as
fast<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.690> possible<00:02:10.009> I'll<00:02:11.009> put<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> link<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
fast as possible I'll put a link on the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.460 
fast as possible I'll put a link on the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
your ballistic knife faster that might

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.130 
your ballistic knife faster that might
come<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.200> handy<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:18.060> save<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.780> best

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
come in handy here and I save the best

come in handy here and I save the best
for<00:02:19.590> last<00:02:20.210> apparently<00:02:21.210> there's<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.690> small

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
for last apparently there's a small

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.170 
for last apparently there's a small
window<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.440> time<00:02:22.560> where<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> AGR<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.850> most

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
window of time where the AGR is the most

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.540 
window of time where the AGR is the most
vulnerable<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.800> as<00:02:25.920> soon<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> pops

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
vulnerable it's right as soon as it pops

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.180 
vulnerable it's right as soon as it pops
out<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.030> box<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.530> can<00:02:28.680> hit<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.980> with

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
out of the box so if you can hit it with

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.760 
out of the box so if you can hit it with
a<00:02:29.220> c4<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:30.060> soon<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> box<00:02:30.900> opens<00:02:31.320> up<00:02:31.470> it's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
a c4 as soon as the box opens up it's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.430 
a c4 as soon as the box opens up it's
done<00:02:32.100> usually<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.180> takes<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.660> see<00:02:33.900> 4s<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.380> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
done usually it takes to see 4s and a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
done usually it takes to see 4s and a
couple<00:02:34.650> bullets<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.340> take<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.760> these<00:02:35.850> down

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
couple bullets to take one of these down

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.270 
couple bullets to take one of these down
but<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.900> trick<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.770> need<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:37.950> one

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
but with this trick all you need is one

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.210 
but with this trick all you need is one
c4<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.000> good<00:02:39.240> timing<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.870> tried<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
c4 in good timing I tried to see if I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.620 
c4 in good timing I tried to see if I
could<00:02:41.280> use<00:02:41.520> other<00:02:41.700> things<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.330> advantage

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
could use other things to take advantage

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.410 
could use other things to take advantage
of<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.960> small<00:02:43.350> window<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.040> maybe<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:44.910> timing

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
of that small window but maybe my timing

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.810 
of that small window but maybe my timing
was<00:02:45.450> off<00:02:45.780> or<00:02:46.110> something<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.860> couldn't<00:02:47.550> seem<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
was off or something I couldn't seem to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.310 
was off or something I couldn't seem to
get<00:02:48.030> anything<00:02:48.270> else<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:48.900> get<00:02:49.050> out<00:02:49.170> in

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
get anything else that they get out in

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.320 
get anything else that they get out in
one<00:02:49.470> shot<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.640> guys<00:02:50.820> figure<00:02:51.209> out

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
one shot but if you guys figure out

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.480 
one shot but if you guys figure out
something<00:02:51.780> else<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:52.590> sure<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.100> put<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
something else be sure to put in the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.000
