that's long enough to go around or not

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.440 
that's long enough to go around or not
and<00:03:02.260> you're<00:03:02.650> going<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.890> take<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.300> back

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.000 

and<00:03:13.010> push<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.700> upwards<00:03:14.590> for<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> top<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.950> your

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
head then after you push it up to where

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.560 
head then after you push it up to where
you<00:03:18.650> kind<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.040> want<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.430> start<00:03:19.730> tightening

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
you kind of want it to start tightening

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.280 
you kind of want it to start tightening
you're<00:03:20.900> going<00:03:21.020> to<00:03:21.080> call<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.500> strength<00:03:24.700> okay

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
you're going to call the strength okay

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.870 
you're going to call the strength okay
now<00:03:27.290> if<00:03:27.440> your<00:03:27.560> string<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.160> short<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.610> can<00:03:28.640> tie

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
now if your string it short you can tie

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.520 
now if your string it short you can tie
it<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.090> front<00:03:29.300> mushrooms<00:03:29.720> long<00:03:29.900> enough<00:03:30.170> to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
it in the front mushrooms long enough to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.990 
it in the front mushrooms long enough to
tie<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.800> right<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> back<00:03:33.730> who's<00:03:34.730> going<00:03:34.910> to

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
tie it right in the back who's going to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.870 
tie it right in the back who's going to
tie<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.360> once<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.080> then<00:03:36.770> pin<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.340> rest<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
tie it once and then pin the rest to the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.210 
tie it once and then pin the rest to the
side<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:38.630> not<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> giant<00:03:39.260> bow<00:03:39.950> in<00:03:40.190> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
side so it's not like a giant bow in the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.100 
side so it's not like a giant bow in the
back<00:03:40.990> into<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.110> bobby<00:03:42.320> pin

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.390 

so<00:03:48.110> right<00:03:48.260> now<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.440> have<00:03:48.710> like<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> puff<00:03:49.190> on<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
so right now you have like a puff on the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.550 
so right now you have like a puff on the
top<00:03:49.550> of<00:03:49.700> your<00:03:49.790> head<00:03:49.990> if<00:03:50.990> your<00:03:51.200> hair<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.380> like

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
top of your head if your hair is like

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.160 
top of your head if your hair is like
mine<00:03:51.800> then<00:03:52.340> your<00:03:52.970> longer<00:03:53.510> length<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.930> probably

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
mine then your longer length is probably

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.770 
mine then your longer length is probably
going<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.350> be<00:03:54.410> at<00:03:54.710> the<00:03:54.800> top<00:03:55.420> not<00:03:56.420> necessarily

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
going to be at the top not necessarily

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.980 
going to be at the top not necessarily
in<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.020> back<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:58.160> gonna<00:03:58.310> flip<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.760> on

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
in the back so you just gonna flip it on

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:13.180 
in the back so you just gonna flip it on
itself<00:04:00.970> seemed<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.000> not<00:04:03.550> okay<00:04:11.830> from<00:04:12.830> there<00:04:13.040> you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
itself seemed to not okay from there you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.180 
itself seemed to not okay from there you
just<00:04:13.220> need<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.490> pin<00:04:14.350> as<00:04:15.350> many<00:04:15.530> pins<00:04:15.740> as<00:04:15.860> you<00:04:15.920> need

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
just need a pin as many pins as you need

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.430 
just need a pin as many pins as you need
and<00:04:16.430> you're<00:04:16.579> going<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.820> pin<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.840> excess<00:04:18.260> hair

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
and you're going to pin the excess hair

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:28.030 
and you're going to pin the excess hair
down<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:22.280> then<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.760> other<00:04:22.790> side<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:27.040> that

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
down and then to the other side and that

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.190 
down and then to the other side and that
is<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.760> literally<00:04:29.330> took<00:04:29.480> me<00:04:29.630> three<00:04:29.930> months<00:04:29.960> to

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
is it literally took me three months to

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.080 
is it literally took me three months to
do<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.410> it's<00:04:31.040> probably<00:04:31.430> gonna<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.640> faster

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
do this it's probably gonna be faster

00:04:32.090 --> 00:05:52.530 
do this it's probably gonna be faster
