00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
system now swinging the box around and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.829 
system now swinging the box around and
actually<00:00:49.610> having<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.089> look<00:00:50.210> at<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.420> back<00:00:50.629> we

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
actually having a look at the back we

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.719 
actually having a look at the back we
can<00:00:50.989> see<00:00:51.140> once<00:00:51.350> again<00:00:51.619> the<00:00:51.769> accelerometer<00:00:52.430> go

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
can see once again the accelerometer go

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.460 
can see once again the accelerometer go
and<00:00:53.059> in<00:00:53.299> two<00:00:53.570> different<00:00:53.869> languages<00:00:54.140> what

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
looks to be German and then of course

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.149 
looks to be German and then of course
English<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.960> tells<00:00:57.229> us<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.739> memory

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
English it tells us that the memory
