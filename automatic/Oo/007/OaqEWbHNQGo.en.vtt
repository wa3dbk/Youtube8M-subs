00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
it's very tight food web anything that

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.189 
it's very tight food web anything that
changes<00:00:59.059> in<00:00:59.239> one<00:00:59.420> part<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.870> affects

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
would not our approach was we will make

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.029 
would not our approach was we will make
the<00:01:24.259> case<00:01:24.530> for<00:01:24.920> fishing<00:01:25.700> in<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.000> Ross<00:01:26.149> Sea<00:01:27.039> but

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
the case for fishing in the Ross Sea but

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.350 
the case for fishing in the Ross Sea but

only on the most strict precautionary
basis<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:35.530> always<00:01:36.530> think<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.770> New<00:01:36.950> Zealand<00:01:37.340> as

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
basis I always think of New Zealand as

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.330 
basis I always think of New Zealand as
an<00:01:37.640> eco<00:01:38.030> friendly<00:01:38.140> country<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.380> tooth<00:01:40.039> fish
