00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 hi guys just come back again 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 marvel ant man movie 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.199
 well, or in our man-ant 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.539
 sorry for our name 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.930
 I didn't like it so I will say 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.390
 it is ant-man that sounds much better and so 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 let's go according to the old scheme saying whether it is worth 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 go to the movie or not and then already 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.750
 I continue to review with spoilers for there 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.149
 have something to discuss new movie came out 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.860
 quite good very dynamic 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.829
 it was the places that the filmmakers 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 tried and more trivia wanted 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 shove into a movie 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 and the film sags only in the middle in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.940
 a couple of dialogues from the beginning of the movie 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.000
 takes good momentum 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 it all starts with a criminal action movie 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.600
 the whole film is permeated with the spirit of the films 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 robberies and even movie mission 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.110
 impracticable 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.660
 there is even a similar scene from that movie and 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.170
 further everything flows into the film dear I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.149
 reduced the children of 89 years are very similar in 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 the result is a film in its structure a bit 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.920
 different from other marvel movies and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 it goes to his advantage and up in the film 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.439
 just a sea of ​​humor is more comedy than 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 fighter for joking well really on every 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.630
 step I can not say that all jokes me 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.909
 laugh but a dozen were very 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.430
 lucky nice that originally 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.049
 the director was edgar wright who shot very 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.710
 i liked scott pilgrim against 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.729
 of all 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.390
 And many more successful comedy shows very 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.159
 much is left of this director the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.189
 who likes to marvel on the movie advise 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.439
 go to the way the other movie 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.990
 marvel to fig they are plain text 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.149
 mention the avengers and even have a decent 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.460
 cafe at one of the avengers you see in 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 cinema who on film advise to go in 3d 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.439
 a lot of good frames with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.710
 calculated on 3d and in general all the frames where 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.409
 ant-man decreases looks awesome in 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.850
 this is a great summer blockbuster 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.310
 which I will put 7 and a half of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 ten pretty strictly could and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.119
 higher but after watching I did not have 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.030
 strong sex effect 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.380
 although steep scenes in the film is very much a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.990
 cons 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.840
 there is almost no such result 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.090
 good movie advise to go 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.420
 some of my friends are fan of 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.670
 minions and even they said the movie 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.090
 wildly dull and even children would not 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.090
 advised to look at the third extra I 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.660

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.150
 Criminal Thief Olya Robin Hood 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.740
 was in prison and it is very 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.010
 non-standard marvel heroes 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.620
 that he is good in the beginning of the film is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.170
 very cool and dynamic robbery 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.790
 it is very quickly mounted and it 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.790
 makes the film dynamic 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.160
 still very cool movie scenes this is the first 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.680

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.000
 new level for margo 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.760

 it was something else strong background included 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.459

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.190
