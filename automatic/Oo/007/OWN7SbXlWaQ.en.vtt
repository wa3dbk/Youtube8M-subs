to move out here right now as the score
I<00:00:35.940> should<00:00:36.149> move<00:00:36.239> out<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> his<00:00:36.690> base<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.920> base<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I should move out to his base to base it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.209 
I should move out to his base to base it
fall<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.420> those<00:00:39.750> Swiper<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
fall back to those Swiper but now the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
fall back to those Swiper but now the
height<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.579> our<00:00:41.820> trap<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
height is our trap but are they going to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
height is our trap but are they going to
have<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.160> don't<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:44.910> that

have that I don't know if these that
will<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.300> enough<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> kill<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.899> these<00:00:46.020> hydras

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
will be enough to kill all these hydras

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.170 
will be enough to kill all these hydras
there<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> Phoenix<00:00:47.550> finally<00:00:47.700> picked<00:00:48.059> up

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
there and the Phoenix finally picked up

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.520 
there and the Phoenix finally picked up
some<00:00:48.329> harder<00:00:48.570> trying<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> slim<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.200> many<00:00:49.410> as

this<00:01:16.380> play<00:01:16.619> style<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.869> more

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this play style right now and so more

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
this play style right now and so more
classes<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> hopefully<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.240> more

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
classes and hopefully there we go more

does have speed right now and we do have

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
does have speed right now and we do have
another<00:01:33.570> hydras<00:01:34.020> compel<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.950> mean

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
another hydras compel here but I mean

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.469 
another hydras compel here but I mean
what<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.390> are

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
what are they going to do here there are

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.179 
what are they going to do here there are
so<00:01:36.630> many<00:01:36.720> Phoenix's<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:37.710> hydras<00:01:38.040> need

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so many Phoenix's that these hydras need

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.149 
so many Phoenix's that these hydras need
to<00:01:38.310> massive<00:01:38.759> massive<00:01:39.390> numbers<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.799> able<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
to massive massive numbers to be able to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219 
to massive massive numbers to be able to
take<00:01:41.400> down<00:01:41.670> Oh<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.630> closer<00:01:42.840> shooting

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
take down Oh in there closer shooting

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
take down Oh in there closer shooting
but<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:44.159> enough<00:01:44.520> energy<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.030> they're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
but there are enough energy but they're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.969 
but there are enough energy but they're
not<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> actually<00:01:45.570> engage<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.829> are

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
not going to actually engage so they are

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.109 
not going to actually engage so they are
going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> try<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
going to try to back out here and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.690 
going to try to back out here and
actually<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.740> finished<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
actually more finished on the way I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
joining these guys so we do have ground

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.039 
joining these guys so we do have ground
armored<00:01:53.189> level<00:01:53.460> 2<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> 0<00:01:54.000> Colossus<00:01:54.750> walking

on the top of the cliff and that thermal

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.600 
on the top of the cliff and that thermal
ads<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.770> coming<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.310> hard

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
ads is really really coming down hard

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.789 
ads is really really coming down hard
with<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> laser<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.200> high<00:02:01.320> blows<00:02:01.530> dying

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
with a laser so that high blows dying

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
with a laser so that high blows dying
really<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.310> fast<00:02:02.460> there<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> charge

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
really really fast there and the charge

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
really really fast there and the charge
laws<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.540> almost<00:02:04.140> charts<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:04.680> but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
laws are almost charts in there but

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
laws are almost charts in there but
there<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.070> four<00:02:05.310> spine<00:02:05.579> crawlers<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.780> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
there are four spine crawlers as as you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.479 
there are four spine crawlers as as you
see<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> core<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.860> trying<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> fall<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
see the core is trying to fall back to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
see the core is trying to fall back to
do<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:08.970> much<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.560> we

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
do to it as much as you can so now we

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
do to it as much as you can so now we
ask<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.009> these<00:02:11.099> dells<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.489> come<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
ask you these dells so come out of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.440 
ask you these dells so come out of
position<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.629> if<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.930> start

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
position there but if you start

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540 
position there but if you start
here<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.840> step<00:02:14.080> out<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.440> these<00:02:14.620> hydras<00:02:15.040> are

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
here and step out all these hydras are

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.490 
here and step out all these hydras are
really<00:02:15.970> really<00:02:16.150> easy<00:02:16.360> they're<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:17.349> actually

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
really really easy they're just actually

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.170 
really really easy they're just actually
getting<00:02:17.739> wild<00:02:18.220> about<00:02:18.370> all<00:02:18.519> these<00:02:18.670> Phoenix's

getting wild about all these Phoenix's
and<00:02:19.650> look<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.040> high<00:02:21.310> year<00:02:21.580> probably

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
and look at that this high year probably

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.130 
and look at that this high year probably
