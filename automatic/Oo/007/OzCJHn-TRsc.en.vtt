00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.300
 Welcome everyone, 

00:00:01.454 --> 00:00:04.178
 Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.535
 A place I'm sure is protected for children 

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:12.136
 Who certainly has no history that might threaten our existence. 

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.673
 But, there's a huge murderous snake down here. 

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:20.737
 And a huge three-headed dog. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.837
 And a tree that can kill you ... 

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:27.187
 And human-sized spiders who can eat your face. 

00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:30.872
 And ... Thank you Professor Dumbledore, whatever you say 

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:33.673
 As he said, welcome to 

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.674
 These candles are dripping everywhere! 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:44.666
 - How was it supposed to end - 

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:52.954
 - How Harry Potter was supposed to end - 

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:03.869
 - This is a great scapegoat, you have to keep it always. 

00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:04.749
 -OK. 

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:07.821
 - not seriously, is too valuable, you must ensure to keep it. 

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:08.881
 "All right, I promise." 

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:13.396
 Harmony, maybe something will happen comfortably and destroy the stylus and make the last, you must promise to keep it! 

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:15.046
 - I promise I will not throw it away! 

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.302
 "What the hell are you two talking about ?! 

00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:42.394
 I'll kill you Harry Potter! 

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.530
 I point my wand as hard as I can! 

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:49.673
 What's the Tom thing ?! You tried to kill me once as a baby and it did not work. 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.383
 I'll destroy you! 

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:56.040
 We've already fought 4 or 5, you know I've just returned from the dead! 

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:57.981
 La la la la ... Not listening ... 

00:01:57.982 --> 00:01:59.682
 I'm too busy killing you! 

00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:00.683
 You're crazy! 

00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:02.926
 And now we're going to kill your pet snake. 

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.995
 The dose is the same! 

00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:06.996
 It's over! 

00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:09.117
 It will never end! 

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:10.974
 Owa Kadbar ... 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.625
 Ah ... weapons of the Muggles ... 

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:19.035
 Professor Snape, you're alive! 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.026
 Of course I'm alive, retarded. 

00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:22.870
 but how? You're really dead! 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.433
 Magic ... clear! 

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:28.369
 I'm a Potions Master and a double agent. Of course I had a backup plan. 

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:32.967
 I have been drinking "badger honey against venom" since I started running around this ridiculous snake. 

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:33.968
 Wow ... 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.069
 Honey badgers have what it takes. 

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:39.761
 Everyone already knows that I can cure bleeding injuries. 

00:02:39.984 --> 00:02:44.130
 Now Mr. Potter, if you bring me your Invisibility Cloak and Miss Grange's turnaround time. 

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.431
 There's one more thing I have to do. 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.272
 Professor, you see if you do it 

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:53.273
 You will not be able to return. 

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:57.395
 I am well aware of the risks and consequences, Mrs. Granger 

00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:00.070
 You'll have to rotate this thing at least 200,000 times, sir. 

00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:03.161
 So it would be better if you did not make me lose the count, not Mr. Weasley. 

00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:04.165
 No, sir. 

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.166
 Good luck sir. 

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:08.064
 Goodbye, children ... 

00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:14.496
 1,2,3,4,5,6 

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:18.998
 262,000 rounds later 

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:27.080
 262,029 .........., 262,030 .........., 262031 

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.381
 I have, I got it! 

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:37.473
 I can make the animals do what I want without taming them, 

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:40.174
 I can make bad things happen to people, 

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:41.592
 if you want. 

00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:43.290
 I can ... Abra Kadbara 

00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:44.980
 What the hell ... 

00:03:45.444 --> 00:03:48.177
 What is? Get that Dark Lord. 

00:03:48.984 --> 00:03:52.736
 Why would you do that? Evans, remove. 

00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:54.894
 Who are you? 

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.143
 Oh, sorry about that. 

00:03:57.352 --> 00:03:59.289
 Just a ... 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.790
 Saving your life. 

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:06.127
 And the future ... and many others ... 

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.039
 it's a long story. 

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:14.190
 -The end- 

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:20.096
 I mean, really long, like something really long that if we had to write it, it would take at least 7 books. 

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.200
 Or eight movies. 

00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:31.222
 I want to introduce our new Professor of Defense from the Dark Forces, Professor Gandalf. 

00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:37.067
 You will not go! 

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.307
 Well, it's a bit tough, 

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.269
 The lesson has not even begun yet. 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.310
 Hi there, Thanks for watching, we hope you enjoyed, register and do not forget to watch more videos. 

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:54.886
 And we have good news 

00:04:55.201 --> 00:05:01.440
 This month we'll give you more videos ... behind the scenes, bonus clips, 

00:05:01.682 --> 00:05:03.562
 Whatever we think of every Thursday. 

00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:06.185
 So do not forget to come back for that. 

00:05:06.508 --> 00:05:08.061
 It's really hard to see these things 

00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:09.887
 Toe, take off those stupid glasses. 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.584
 I will never take off those glasses. 

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:13.758
 We'll see you on Thursday.
