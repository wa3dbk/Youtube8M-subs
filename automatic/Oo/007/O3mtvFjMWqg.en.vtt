00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.170
 now that substance is present without 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.320
 digital and this time we continue here 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 in las vegas with the navy theme we are going to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.759
 speak I know that a product that I do not know 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.349
 showed directly in the center of 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.310
 conventions however probably 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.449
 be the highlight of this expo for 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.890
 us we need is a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.260
 spectrometer 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.610
 for people who do not know what it's for 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.800
 a spectrometer is basically a 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.220
 instrument that helps us measure the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.739
 with this temperature 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.780
 we aim to towards a 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.820
 lamp or somewhere and it tells us 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.960
 exactly what is the temperature in 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.449
 Kelvin degrees of the emitting source but 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.699
 besides this it allows us to know more 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.650
 detailed information about the 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.480
 quality of the light of a lamp in 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.970
 particular according to certain 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.399
 parameters now in the case of this 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.399
 device what is interesting is that as 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.410
 you can see we have a part 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.530
 up here and this bottom part can 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.170
 look very similar to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.690
 there are pictures and in fact it is a mortgage 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 then this makes it a very device 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.150
 versatile in the sense that it is not 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 only a traditional spectrometer 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.800
 with preset functions but 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.950
 when working via bluetooth with him with the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.780
 aic with the ipod toch allows us 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.009
 update the application and have a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.659
 series of additional functions in this 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.610
 case has the function to check the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.560
 color color chryler temperature the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.330
 correlated temperature has 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 functions for girls serra and for 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.170
 check if it 's r 115 re the quality of the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 color the illuminance how many 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.330
 this how many candles have how many 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 lumens has all agreed 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.460
 Parameters of light according to hundred 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 thousand 231 thousand 276 that is that spectrum of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.819
 light covers the lamp in particular the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.720
 radio the purity of light is to say a 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.160
 series of functions that obviously gives us 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.290
 a lot of information about 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.940
 from a particular light source 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 then we simply give 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.570
 we select here the parameters of what 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.670
 that we want to measure we give 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.190
 next and in this case I'm enlightened 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.680
 with one with a flint lamp here and 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.130
 to do the measurement simply I the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.220
 I just pressed the button and then the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.470
 device starts to take the reading and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.870
 he adds and throws me that all 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.980
 parameters then right now for example 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.700
 it tells me that the temperature 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.630
 correlated is 4 thousand 102 kelvin is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.880
 say it goes to precision of 102 no 4104 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.510
 at 102 point he tells us that he has a being 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.020
 king of 95 according to being king you are a 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:07.360
 94 etc. gives us 600 looks has 55.8 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.040
 judging them is practically all 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.570
 the parameters but not only that in the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290
 moment in which I move here 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.420
 shows on a graph exactly where 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.430
 is the light that is what is doing 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.190
 the light as it is doing shows me 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.740
 here also the spectrum where is 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.980
 exactly the point of light 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.110
 so pull to some color or pull towards 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.510
 another has also here the full range 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.830
 that is to say it has all the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.100
 tools so that we can 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.220
 judge a light and obviously power 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 determine is a good light or not for 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.760
 that basically works for us 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.010
 well we know that there are alternate sources 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.020
 of lighting is now led is 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.790
 remote match 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.990
 is for example the plasma lights what 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.510
 that I was thinking that is driving this 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.940
 company jaime and 12 then some are 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.220
 very good others not and others are 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 very bad then for example this 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.940
 flint lamp that we have here has 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.130
 a very very high level however here 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.310
 we have for example a Chinese bulb 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.530
 A pretty Chinese LED lamp 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.420
 economic and if we do the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.430
 measurement here for example let's 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.959
 make the measurement we remember that with 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.450
 is here so we have here we bring a 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.130
 be king of 95 if I take this lamp 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.540
 here obviously it's going to look weird 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.180
 what I 'm going to do but because 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.150
 obviously 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.320
 will illuminate others but I take here my 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.320
 my lamp 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.480
 and he placed it here and I tell him what measure 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.070
 then at the moment when I 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.020
 say that he looks at me he will take me 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.600
 reading and in this case I know that there is the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.910
 person lamp with very low quality 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.910
 so here, for example, tells me 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.320
 color temperature are five thousand 477 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.570
 that obviously when you saw it 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 at first sight the light was pulling more towards 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.070
 daylight but for example in being 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.110
 King marks me that he has a being king of 76 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.560
 He is a king and be much lower 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.860
 against the 94 in that it is not affected or what 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.010
 or what does this have to do that obviously 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.570
 if he laughs and is low then the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.070
 Color reproduction is low ie 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.900
 it will not show us the colors 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.850
 really like they are even here because 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.770
 example we had at the time we were 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.690
 making the measurements with this lamp 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.540
 that you just showed them for example in 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.990
 the spectrum the red ones have 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.120
 practically in four is to say in a 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.090
 scale from 0 to 100 the reds are 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.680
 taking on a level 4 why because the 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.790
 range of light is very poor 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.650
 then here we can realize 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.990
 How do we have to correct what is the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.030
 actual color temperature and so on 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.570
 which obviously a device does 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.500
 super interesting and a device 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.530
 indispensable for many of the 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.169
 productions in addition when working through 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.479
 of an ios or android device 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.389
 allows firmware updating and 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.270
 in fact the version that the version that 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.830
 They showed us the people who 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.129
 develop this device which is a 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.830
 company called acens tech 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:11.199
 they also bring the application to 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.369
 can measure tlc which is the tlc and is this 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.889
 new measure that is being developed 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.179
 since being king for a lot of people is 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.919
 considered obsolete for new 

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:20.050
 lighting sources then it is 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.219
 developed that average tlc and they what 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.050
 what they do is simply create the 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.699
 application put it communicates 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.459
 directly with him with the device 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.469
 this and then we will be able to measure tele 

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.239
 6 directly through this 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:35.770
 device now if we do not 

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:39.240
 we want the complete device this 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.240
 can be separated from here 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.170
 and basically what we have here is the 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.600
 spectrometer this is this gadget 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.700
 little one that we have here and this is a and 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.710
 this is the iphone the ipod toch then 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.590
 I can take this spectrometer 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.570
 connect the bluetooth via read to me 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.730
 ipad can connect it to my phone 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.470
 android and do precisely all the 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.030
 measurements directly from any 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.370
 device which makes it extremely 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.490
 compact extremely portable even in 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.460
 The case comes with adapters for 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.860
 be able to place this piece on a stand 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.220
 for tripod for example and place in a 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.990
 tripié in a tripod the meter and even 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.700
 I withdraw from the light source to 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.810
 be able to do the measurement and have 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.790
 obviously a much more measurement 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.380
 accurate so definitely this 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.550
 device do this called 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.610
 lighting password 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:34.060
 and it is for us one of the highlights 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:37.450
 of navy in particular is a tool 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:41.460
 Your super versatile product is not a 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:44.530
 cheap equipment but it's really a 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.780
 very useful tool to be able to have 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.730
 a correct temperature to be able 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.720
 calibrate our cameras so 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.240
 correct especially if we're 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.590
 working in mixed light to know if 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.150
 really the light with which we are 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:59.860
 working is a good light so what 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.050
 interest you can know a little more 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.880
 about these devices in the 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:07.410
