I<00:04:05.310> think<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.269> next<00:04:06.690> best<00:04:06.900> thing<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.169> you<00:04:07.410> can

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
I think the next best thing that you can

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.340 
I think the next best thing that you can
get

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
get

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.610 
get
and<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:09.220> completely<00:04:09.910> recommend<00:04:10.300> getting<00:04:10.960> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
and I completely recommend getting the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.010 
and I completely recommend getting the
booster<00:04:12.010> over<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:13.120> starter<00:04:13.480> even<00:04:13.780> though<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
booster over it starter even though the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.900 
booster over it starter even though the
starter<00:04:14.260> comes<00:04:14.440> with<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.620> bait<00:04:14.770> pointer<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.490> I

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
starter comes with a bait pointer and I

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.720 
starter comes with a bait pointer and I
say<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.330> because<00:04:17.250> with<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.340> booster<00:04:18.640> you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
say that because with the booster you

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.520 
say that because with the booster you
save<00:04:18.970> more<00:04:19.150> money<00:04:19.180> there's<00:04:19.780> less<00:04:19.989> things<00:04:20.200> and

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
save more money there's less things and
