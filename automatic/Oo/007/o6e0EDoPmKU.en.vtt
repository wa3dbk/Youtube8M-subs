00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
to sonic paint considering that the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.790 
to sonic paint considering that the
recorded<00:00:20.030> attempt<00:00:20.480> was<00:00:20.630> my<00:00:20.810> first<00:00:21.170> attempt<00:00:21.710> I

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.830 
recorded attempt was my first attempt I
don't<00:00:22.130> think<00:00:22.400> it<00:00:22.550> was<00:00:22.670> quite<00:00:23.000> fair<00:00:23.390> that<00:00:23.570> job

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
don't think it was quite fair that job

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
today is going to be an attempt not to

of the high scores that are out there at

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.190 
of the high scores that are out there at
the<00:00:34.670> moment<00:00:34.820> we've<00:00:35.420> already<00:00:35.540> got<00:00:35.780> quite<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:35.989> few

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
the moment we've already got quite a few

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200 
the moment we've already got quite a few
video<00:00:36.470> responses<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.250> I<00:00:37.310> thank<00:00:37.579> you<00:00:37.730> all<00:00:37.970> for

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
them they've been very entertaining to

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.610 
them they've been very entertaining to
watch<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.870> yet<00:00:41.870> another<00:00:41.899> reason<00:00:42.230> I'm<00:00:42.500> doing

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
watch and yet another reason I'm doing

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.040 
watch and yet another reason I'm doing
this<00:00:42.770> is<00:00:42.920> because<00:00:43.100> i<00:00:43.340> have<00:00:43.610> no<00:00:44.000> sunday<00:00:44.540> content

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
this is because i have no sunday content

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.200 
this is because i have no sunday content
today<00:00:45.230> i<00:00:45.620> really<00:00:46.520> couldn't<00:00:46.760> think<00:00:46.940> of<00:00:47.090> what

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
today i really couldn't think of what

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.670 
today i really couldn't think of what
else<00:00:47.240> I<00:00:47.450> wanted<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.780> upload<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.380> just

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
else I wanted to upload so I just

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.050 
else I wanted to upload so I just
thought<00:00:48.800> I'd<00:00:48.860> do<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:49.280> rather<00:00:49.610> than<00:00:49.820> take<00:00:50.030> a

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
thought I'd do this rather than take a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.660 
thought I'd do this rather than take a
day<00:00:50.270> off<00:00:50.450> but<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.380> don't<00:00:51.740> really<00:00:51.920> have<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.250> lot<00:00:52.460> to

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
day off but I don't really have a lot to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
day off but I don't really have a lot to
say<00:00:52.880> commentary<00:00:53.720> wise<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:56.270> only<00:00:56.510> thing

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
say commentary wise the only thing

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.510 
say commentary wise the only thing
actually<00:00:56.900> struck<00:00:57.470> me<00:00:57.650> is<00:00:57.800> quite<00:00:58.010> interesting

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
actually struck me is quite interesting

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.760 
actually struck me is quite interesting
about<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:58.910> hack<00:00:59.150> in<00:00:59.300> particular<00:00:59.600> is<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.140> while

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
about this hack in particular is a while

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.740 
about this hack in particular is a while
ago<00:01:01.130> I<00:01:01.400> don't<00:01:01.850> know<00:01:02.000> if<00:01:02.150> some<00:01:02.390> people

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
ago I don't know if some people

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.689 
ago I don't know if some people
remembered<00:01:03.350> I<00:01:03.470> got<00:01:03.710> an<00:01:03.860> email<00:01:04.070> from<00:01:04.280> a

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
remembered I got an email from a

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.490 
remembered I got an email from a
specific<00:01:04.939> gaming<00:01:05.600> convention<00:01:06.079> saying<00:01:06.380> they

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
specific gaming convention saying they

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.399 
specific gaming convention saying they
were<00:01:06.590> having<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:07.040> sonic<00:01:07.610> sunday<00:01:08.240> event<00:01:08.479> which

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
were having a sonic sunday event which

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.020 
were having a sonic sunday event which
unfortunately<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.340> convention<00:01:10.850> got

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
unfortunately the convention got

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.670 
unfortunately the convention got
canceled<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.869> that's<00:01:12.049> why<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.259> didn't<00:01:12.560> go<00:01:12.650> to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
canceled so that's why I didn't go to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.310 
canceled so that's why I didn't go to
their<00:01:12.950> hand<00:01:13.189> when<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:13.970> reinvented<00:01:14.689> me<00:01:14.930> for

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
their hand when they reinvented me for

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.350 
their hand when they reinvented me for
the<00:01:15.470> anime<00:01:15.799> expo<00:01:16.070> unfortunately<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.000> couldn't

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
the anime expo unfortunately I couldn't

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.880 
the anime expo unfortunately I couldn't
get<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.630> time<00:01:17.840> off<00:01:17.869> work<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.439> that<00:01:18.590> kind<00:01:18.740> of

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
get the time off work to that kind of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.109 
get the time off work to that kind of
stuff<00:01:19.600> but<00:01:20.600> originally<00:01:21.289> they<00:01:22.280> said<00:01:22.310> maybe<00:01:22.789> you

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
stuff but originally they said maybe you

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.029 
stuff but originally they said maybe you
could<00:01:23.420> run<00:01:23.630> some<00:01:23.810> kind<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.079> competitions<00:01:24.679> and

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
could run some kind of competitions and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.649 
could run some kind of competitions and
I<00:01:25.100> originally<00:01:25.280> thought<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:26.119> can't<00:01:26.509> really

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
I originally thought I can't really

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.389 
I originally thought I can't really
think<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.899> any<00:01:27.049> other<00:01:27.229> kind<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.619> like<00:01:28.039> hack

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
think of any other kind of like hack

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.620 
think of any other kind of like hack
that<00:01:28.640> would<00:01:28.759> be<00:01:28.850> good<00:01:29.030> for<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.240> competition

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that would be good for a competition

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.959 
that would be good for a competition
unless<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.200> were<00:01:30.289> doing<00:01:30.759> speedruns<00:01:31.759> of

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
unless you were doing speedruns of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.609 
unless you were doing speedruns of
levels<00:01:32.299> trying<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.600> beat<00:01:32.780> levels<00:01:33.079> as<00:01:33.229> fast<00:01:33.439> as

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
levels trying to beat levels as fast as

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.969 
levels trying to beat levels as fast as
possible<00:01:34.060> thanks<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.090> marquee<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.439> might<00:01:36.740> be

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
possible thanks to marquee this might be

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.129 
possible thanks to marquee this might be
the<00:01:37.130> hack<00:01:37.429> that<00:01:37.789> I<00:01:37.819> could<00:01:38.179> have<00:01:38.299> used<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.929> mean

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:39.139 
the hack that I could have used I mean

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:40.899 
the hack that I could have used I mean
this<00:01:39.289> this<00:01:39.350> would<00:01:39.770> be<00:01:39.979> perfect<00:01:40.249> wouldn't<00:01:40.819> it

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
this this would be perfect wouldn't it

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.999 
this this would be perfect wouldn't it
it's<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.479> high<00:01:41.630> score<00:01:41.990> based<00:01:42.259> completely<00:01:42.859> on

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
it's a high score based completely on

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.949 
it's a high score based completely on
skill<00:01:43.639> alone<00:01:43.850> when<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.209> comes<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.569> knowing<00:01:44.749> the

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
skill alone when it comes to knowing the

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.440 
skill alone when it comes to knowing the
layout<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.590> sonic<00:01:45.829> levels<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.579> it's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
layout of the sonic levels and it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.879 
layout of the sonic levels and it's
actually<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.869> really<00:01:48.200> interesting<00:01:48.560> way<00:01:48.859> of

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
actually a really interesting way of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.520 
actually a really interesting way of
doing<00:01:49.249> it<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.579> if<00:01:49.759> anything<00:01:50.209> if<00:01:50.780> ever<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.079> do<00:01:51.200> go

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
doing it so if anything if ever I do go

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.340

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
might be the perfect hat for me to bring

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.499 
might be the perfect hat for me to bring
when<00:01:58.249> it<00:01:58.340> comes<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.729> doing<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.060> competition

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
when it comes to doing that competition

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.230 
when it comes to doing that competition
I<00:02:00.069> did<00:02:01.069> quite<00:02:01.219> well<00:02:01.279> on<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.609> first<00:02:01.850> level<00:02:02.060> I

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
I did quite well on the first level I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.429 
I did quite well on the first level I
got<00:02:02.420> like<00:02:02.569> four<00:02:02.840> thousand<00:02:03.259> three<00:02:03.409> hundred

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
got like four thousand three hundred

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.020 
got like four thousand three hundred
that<00:02:03.889> wasn't<00:02:04.130> bad<00:02:04.749> especially<00:02:05.749> since<00:02:06.139> I've

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
that wasn't bad especially since I've

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.330 
that wasn't bad especially since I've
had<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> little<00:02:08.270> oh<00:02:08.479> my<00:02:08.690> God<00:02:08.990> look<00:02:09.020> at<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.920> am

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
had a little oh my God look at this I am

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.480 
had a little oh my God look at this I am
amazing<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.540> by<00:02:11.780> amazing<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.319> mean

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
amazing in this and by amazing I mean

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.400 
amazing in this and by amazing I mean
extremely<00:02:13.490> lucky<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:14.209> don't<00:02:14.930> even<00:02:15.080> know<00:02:15.260> how<00:02:15.380> I

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
extremely lucky I don't even know how I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.589 
extremely lucky I don't even know how I
did<00:02:15.500> half<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:17.150> I've<00:02:17.300> decided

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
did half of this but I've decided

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.170 
did half of this but I've decided
that<00:02:17.810> obviously<00:02:18.740> going<00:02:19.160> down<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.730> pipe<00:02:19.940> at

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that obviously going down the pipe at

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.570 
that obviously going down the pipe at
the<00:02:20.300> very<00:02:20.480> end<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.959> not<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> good<00:02:21.830> idea<00:02:21.860> because

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the very end is not a good idea because

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.760 
the very end is not a good idea because
it<00:02:22.820> corners<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.140> can't<00:02:24.350> really<00:02:24.530> get

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
it corners you and you can't really get

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.830 
it corners you and you can't really get
out<00:02:24.980> without<00:02:25.220> spindash<00:02:25.880> helping<00:02:26.360> considering

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
out without spindash helping considering

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.720 
out without spindash helping considering
this<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.170> sonic<00:02:27.470> 1<00:02:27.680> don't<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:28.640> you're

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
this in a sonic 1 don't think you're

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.280 
this in a sonic 1 don't think you're
going<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.910> be<00:02:29.000> finding<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.600> unfortunately

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
going to be finding that unfortunately

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.340 
going to be finding that unfortunately
so<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.190> good<00:02:31.400> way<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.640> do<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.060> would<00:02:32.210> be<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.420> get

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
so a good way to do that would be to get

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.930 
so a good way to do that would be to get
a<00:02:33.410> majority<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.070> bottom<00:02:34.340> path<00:02:34.520> near<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
a majority of the bottom path near the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.730 
a majority of the bottom path near the
end<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.360> then<00:02:35.570> kind<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.990> try<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.260> fill<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
end and then kind of try and fill in the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.550 
end and then kind of try and fill in the
ending<00:02:37.070> with<00:02:37.280> your<00:02:37.400> time<00:02:37.670> there<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.990> or<00:02:39.170> not<00:02:39.200> I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
ending with your time there so or not I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.440 
ending with your time there so or not I
could<00:02:39.770> maybe<00:02:40.250> spent<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.820> little<00:02:40.970> more<00:02:41.180> time

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
could maybe spent a little more time

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.080 
could maybe spent a little more time
underneath<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.890> got<00:02:43.370> still<00:02:43.640> good<00:02:43.880> four

in<00:03:19.940> my<00:03:20.570> comments<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.080> all<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.380> link<00:03:21.560> isn't

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
in my comments I all the link isn't

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.260 
in my comments I all the link isn't
working<00:03:21.830> yet<00:03:22.250> when<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.460> click<00:03:22.730> on<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.940> link<00:03:23.120> it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.000 
working yet when I click on the link it
looks<00:03:23.630> fine<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.320> thought<00:03:24.590> maybe<00:03:24.650> they'd

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
looks fine so I thought maybe they'd

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.970 
looks fine so I thought maybe they'd
have<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.310> sign<00:03:25.640> up<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:26.030> guess<00:03:26.770> but<00:03:27.770> now<00:03:27.860> if

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
have to sign up I guess but now if

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.770
