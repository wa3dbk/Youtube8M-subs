00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
race as much as I can

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.670 
race as much as I can
last<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:37.820> next<00:01:38.630> thing<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.840> got<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.049> do<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.440> make

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
last so next thing you got to do is make

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680 
last so next thing you got to do is make
sure<00:01:39.860> that<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.130> jack<00:01:40.340> has<00:01:40.520> raised<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.479> rest

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
sure that the jack has raised the rest

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.969 
sure that the jack has raised the rest
of<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.869> way<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.530> extremely

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
of the way and this is extremely

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.520 
of the way and this is extremely
important<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:44.630> jack<00:01:44.869> itself<00:01:45.170> cannot

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
important because the jack itself cannot

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.789 
important because the jack itself cannot
raise<00:01:45.909> raise<00:01:46.909> up<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.180> foot<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.530> point

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
raise raise up the foot to the point

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.920 
raise raise up the foot to the point
where<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.280> won't<00:01:49.430> hit<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.610> ground<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.720> what

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
where it won't hit the ground so what

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.149 
where it won't hit the ground so what
you<00:01:51.049> want<00:01:51.229> going<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.500> want<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.649> do<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.979> pull

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
you want going to want to do is to pull

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.480 
you want going to want to do is to pull
out<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.399> this<00:01:52.610> handle<00:01:52.970> here<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:54.440> it'll<00:01:55.369> drop

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
out on this handle here and it'll drop

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.219 
out on this handle here and it'll drop
to<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.759> ground

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
to the ground

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.150 
to the ground
and<00:01:57.229> then<00:01:57.320> from<00:01:57.530> here<00:01:58.899> pull<00:01:59.899> up<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.289> there<00:02:01.130> I

and then from here pull up on it there I
lock<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> handle<00:02:01.580> into<00:02:01.880> place<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:04.759> now<00:02:04.909> we

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
lock the handle into place so now we

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.270 
lock the handle into place so now we
don't<00:02:05.330> have<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.570> worry<00:02:05.750> about<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:07.070> jack

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280

don't have to worry about the jack
hitting<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> ground<00:02:07.850> now<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> next<00:02:09.019> thing

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
hitting the ground now the next thing

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.180 
hitting the ground now the next thing
you<00:02:09.200> got<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> back<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
we have to hook this up now what this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.910 
we have to hook this up now what this
does<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.790> controls<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.330> brakes<00:02:29.650> from<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
does is it controls the brakes from the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.360 
does is it controls the brakes from the
cab

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
cab

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.770 
cab
inside<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> truck<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:35.209> controls<00:02:35.570> light

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
inside the truck and it controls light

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.560 
inside the truck and it controls light
in<00:02:36.049> terms<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.860> lights<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.160> turn<00:02:37.220> signals

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
in terms of the lights and turn signals

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.250 
in terms of the lights and turn signals
so<00:02:39.160> usually<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.280> plugs<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.610> right<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:41.260> these

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
so usually it plugs in right here these

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.110 
so usually it plugs in right here these
come<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.590> different<00:02:42.620> shapes<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.370> sizes<00:02:43.459> so

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
come in different shapes and sizes so

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.120 
come in different shapes and sizes so
they<00:02:44.480> vary<00:02:44.780> by<00:02:44.959> truck<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.410> trailer<00:02:45.739> you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
they vary by truck and trailer you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.050 
they vary by truck and trailer you
always<00:02:46.310> want<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.459> make<00:02:46.579> sure<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.940> have

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
always want to make sure that you have

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060 
always want to make sure that you have
the<00:02:47.180> right<00:02:47.329> one<00:02:47.840> wing<00:02:48.019> before<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.440> go<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.650> go

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
the right one wing before you go on go

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.270 
the right one wing before you go on go
to<00:02:49.130> hook<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.840> I'm<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:53.829> just<00:02:54.829> lift<00:02:55.160> up

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
to hook up so I'm going to just lift up

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.970 
to hook up so I'm going to just lift up
on<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:58.390> sticker<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.540> there<00:02:59.780> make<00:03:00.650> sure<00:03:00.799> she's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
on this sticker in there make sure she's

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.569 
on this sticker in there make sure she's
locked<00:03:01.160> in<00:03:02.170> now<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.920> next<00:03:04.190> thing<00:03:04.340> we're<00:03:04.489> gonna

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
locked in now the next thing we're gonna

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.050 
locked in now the next thing we're gonna
do<00:03:05.380> hop<00:03:06.380> up<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.370> always<00:03:07.489> want<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.000> make

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
do hop up in you always want to make

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.699 
do hop up in you always want to make
sure<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.510> lock<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.049> trailer<00:03:09.410> itself

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
sure that you lock on the trailer itself

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.150 
sure that you lock on the trailer itself
to<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.100> fifth<00:03:10.310> wheel<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:12.079> here<00:03:12.799> what<00:03:13.100> I'm

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
to the fifth wheel and here what I'm

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.050 
to the fifth wheel and here what I'm
gonna<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.430> kick<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.540> into<00:03:14.660> place<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.850> got<00:03:16.940> to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
gonna do kick it into place you got to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.000 
gonna do kick it into place you got to
turn<00:03:17.239> this<00:03:17.420> handle<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.380> lock<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:20.799> there<00:03:21.799> she's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
turn this handle to lock it there she's

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.270 
turn this handle to lock it there she's
locked<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:23.480> now<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:24.079> theory<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.920> trailer

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
locked so now in theory the trailer

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.250 
locked so now in theory the trailer
should<00:03:25.489> not<00:03:26.799> should<00:03:27.799> not<00:03:27.859> roll<00:03:28.160> away

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
should not should not roll away

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.650 
should not should not roll away
these<00:03:30.260> chains<00:03:30.560> here<00:03:31.060> serve<00:03:32.060> as<00:03:32.209> kind<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.600> like

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
these chains here serve as kind of like

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.420 
these chains here serve as kind of like
a<00:03:32.780> support<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.380> in<00:03:33.470> case<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.799> system<00:03:34.220> fails

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.550 

and<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.970> newer<00:03:39.120> trucks<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:40.080> the

and in the newer trucks on the
fifth-wheel<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:41.730> are<00:03:41.910> actually<00:03:42.420> links

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
fifth-wheel there are actually links

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.660 
fifth-wheel there are actually links
that<00:03:43.110> come<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.590> truck<00:03:43.740> itself<00:03:44.070> took

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
that come out of the truck itself took

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.970 
that come out of the truck itself took
up<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.090> hook<00:03:45.240> on<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.810> don't<00:03:46.650> really<00:03:46.830> like

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
up to hook on to I don't really like

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.360 
up to hook on to I don't really like
this<00:03:47.190> style<00:03:47.970> because<00:03:48.570> let's<00:03:49.530> say<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.130> pin

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
this style because let's say the pin

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.890 
this style because let's say the pin
that<00:03:50.790> holds<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.240> fifth<00:03:51.450> wheel<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that holds in the fifth wheel to the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.280 
that holds in the fifth wheel to the
truck<00:03:52.170> comes<00:03:53.120> comes<00:03:54.120> out<00:03:54.300> or<00:03:54.510> breaks<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:54.959> snaps

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
truck comes comes out or breaks or snaps

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.680 
truck comes comes out or breaks or snaps
or<00:03:55.500> something<00:03:55.860> then<00:03:56.550> these<00:03:57.030> chains<00:03:57.330> will<00:03:57.480> do

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
or something then these chains will do

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.390 
or something then these chains will do
absolutely<00:03:57.870> nothing<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.560> keep<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.920> trailer

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
absolutely nothing to keep the trailer

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.570 
absolutely nothing to keep the trailer
from<00:03:59.610> flipping<00:04:00.480> or<00:04:00.720> flipping<00:04:01.310> backwards<00:04:02.310> and

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
from flipping or flipping backwards and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.540 
from flipping or flipping backwards and
rolling<00:04:03.360> away<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.950> next<00:04:05.160> thing<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.370> want

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
rolling away so the next thing you want

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.180 
rolling away so the next thing you want
to<00:04:05.580> do<00:04:06.230> is<00:04:07.230> hook<00:04:07.410> up<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.770> actual<00:04:08.010> brake

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
to do is hook up the actual brake

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.210 
to do is hook up the actual brake
controller<00:04:08.580> itself<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> here<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.130> it

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
controller itself so here we have it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.460 
controller itself so here we have it
hooked<00:04:11.340> up<00:04:11.520> onto<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.450> chain<00:04:12.890> what<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.130> do

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
hooked up onto the chain what you can do

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.310 
hooked up onto the chain what you can do
is<00:04:16.470> unhook<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.720> then<00:04:18.720> I'm<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.109> going<00:04:19.260> to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
is unhook it and then I'm not going to

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.850 
is unhook it and then I'm not going to
do<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.530> right<00:04:19.739> now<00:04:19.769> but<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:21.470> can<00:04:22.470> unhook<00:04:22.710> it

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
do this right now but you can unhook it

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.820 
do this right now but you can unhook it
and<00:04:23.100> find<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.460> place<00:04:23.640> on<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.180> truck<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:25.380> if

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
and find a place on the truck that if

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.490 
and find a place on the truck that if
this<00:04:26.460> little<00:04:26.760> system<00:04:27.030> fails<00:04:27.270> let's<00:04:28.200> say<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
this little system fails let's say the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.070 
this little system fails let's say the
pin<00:04:28.650> underneath<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.220> fifth<00:04:29.400> wheel<00:04:29.580> comes<00:04:29.820> out

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
pin underneath the fifth wheel comes out

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.040 
pin underneath the fifth wheel comes out
then<00:04:31.080> this<00:04:31.890> will<00:04:32.100> catch<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.690> will<00:04:33.810> pull

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
then this will catch and it will pull

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.350 
then this will catch and it will pull
out<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> pin<00:04:34.560> here<00:04:35.720> like<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.840> just<00:04:37.050> did<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:38.360> what

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
out a pin here like I just did and what

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.920 
out a pin here like I just did and what
that<00:04:39.510> does<00:04:39.750> is<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:41.190> relays<00:04:41.580> back<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.720> brake

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
that does is it relays back to the brake

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.980 
that does is it relays back to the brake
controller<00:04:43.760> up<00:04:44.760> here<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:47.490> what<00:04:47.640> this<00:04:47.760> does<00:04:48.320> is

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
controller up here and what this does is

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.020 
controller up here and what this does is
when<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.110> pin<00:04:52.350> pulls<00:04:52.620> out<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.520> trailer<00:04:53.880> will

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
when that pin pulls out the trailer will

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.670 
when that pin pulls out the trailer will
automatically<00:04:54.660> start<00:04:54.930> locking<00:04:55.140> its<00:04:55.380> brakes

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
automatically start locking its brakes

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.980 
automatically start locking its brakes
and<00:04:56.130> this<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> safety<00:04:56.850> system<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.840> make<00:04:57.960> sure

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
and this is a safety system to make sure

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.150 
and this is a safety system to make sure
that<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.410> don't<00:04:58.500> have<00:04:58.650> any<00:04:58.800> rollaway

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
that you don't have any rollaway

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.450 
that you don't have any rollaway
trailers<00:04:59.610> because<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.780> would<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:01.460> without

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
trailers because this would be without

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.950 
trailers because this would be without
something<00:05:02.700> like<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:03.030> in<00:05:03.180> place<00:05:03.419> trailers

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
something like this in place trailers

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.830 
something like this in place trailers
could<00:05:04.290> be<00:05:04.380> very<00:05:04.740> very<00:05:05.010> dangerous<00:05:05.600> if<00:05:06.600> they

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840
