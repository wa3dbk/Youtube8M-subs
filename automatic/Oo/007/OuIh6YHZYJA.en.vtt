00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
we pulled the the old vineyard out it's

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.420 
we pulled the the old vineyard out it's
about<00:00:02.970> 25<00:00:03.570> years<00:00:03.780> old<00:00:04.020> back<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.830> August<00:00:05.279> of

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
about 25 years old back in August of

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480 
about 25 years old back in August of
last<00:00:05.640> year<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:07.140> we<00:00:07.200> wind<00:00:07.589> rode<00:00:07.830> all<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.220> vines

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
last year and we wind rode all the vines

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.129 
last year and we wind rode all the vines
here<00:00:08.880> along<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> railroad<00:00:09.450> tracks<00:00:09.929> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
here along the railroad tracks and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.650 
here along the railroad tracks and
really<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.650> I'm<00:00:10.769> thoroughly<00:00:11.010> dried<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.849> so

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
really that I'm thoroughly dried out so

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660 
really that I'm thoroughly dried out so
we<00:00:12.780> could<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.019> our<00:00:13.200> ground<00:00:13.500> preparation<00:00:14.400> over

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
we could do our ground preparation over

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.849 
we could do our ground preparation over
here<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> block<00:00:16.020> which

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
here and the in the block which

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.599 
here and the in the block which
consisted<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.760> deep<00:00:18.480> ripping<00:00:19.400> getting<00:00:20.400> rid<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
consisted of deep ripping getting rid of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
consisted of deep ripping getting rid of
all<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.090> roots<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.750> find<00:00:22.050> any<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
all the roots that we can find any of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
all the roots that we can find any of
the<00:00:22.710> debris<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.460> underground<00:00:24.060> before

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the debris that was underground before

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.900 
the debris that was underground before
the<00:00:25.230> ripping<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.650> had<00:00:25.769> put<00:00:25.949> down<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.160> compost

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the ripping we had put down a compost

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.230 
the ripping we had put down a compost
mix<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.070> incorporate<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
mix so we can incorporate that into the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680 
mix so we can incorporate that into the
soil<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.779> well<00:00:31.309> in<00:00:32.309> part<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.730> our<00:00:32.820> preparation

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
soil as well in part of our preparation

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.490 
soil as well in part of our preparation
and<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> ripping<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.760> four<00:00:36.000> feet

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
and did the ripping down to four feet

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.080 
and did the ripping down to four feet
put<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> irrigation<00:00:37.980> system<00:00:38.879> and

posts and the center rods here we'll

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
posts and the center rods here we'll
have<00:01:00.420> another<00:01:00.780> wire<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.520> bring<00:01:02.730> these

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
have another wire so when we bring these

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.870 
have another wire so when we bring these
vines<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> train<00:01:04.890> them<00:01:05.010> up<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
vines up we can train them up here and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.179 
vines up we can train them up here and
train<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.810> along<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> wire<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:07.799> turn

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
train them along this wire and then turn

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.630 
train them along this wire and then turn
them<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.970> make<00:01:09.659> nice<00:01:09.900> cord<00:01:10.290> ons<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.490> our

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
them to make nice cord ons out to our

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
them to make nice cord ons out to our
other<00:01:12.060> wires<00:01:12.560> we're<00:01:13.560> pulling<00:01:14.400> away<00:01:14.520> from

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
other wires we're pulling away from

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.850 
other wires we're pulling away from
using<00:01:15.060> wood<00:01:15.630> products<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.350> treated<00:01:16.710> wood

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
using wood products or treated wood

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
using wood products or treated wood
products<00:01:17.369> mainly<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> disposal

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
products mainly because of the disposal

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.710 
products mainly because of the disposal
problems<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.040> even<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.090> treated<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
problems and even if it's treated it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.550 
problems and even if it's treated it
still<00:01:21.990> rots

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
still rots

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
still rots
so<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.430> trellis<00:01:23.820> system<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.330> designed<00:01:24.509> for

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
so this trellis system is designed for

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.460 
so this trellis system is designed for
all<00:01:25.229> steel<00:01:25.740> heavy-duty<00:01:26.460> steel<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
all steel heavy-duty steel this is for

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
all steel heavy-duty steel this is for
example<00:01:28.890> two<00:01:28.979> four<00:01:29.220> pound<00:01:29.520> rail<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.479> they

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
example two four pound rail what they

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
example two four pound rail what they
call<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> four<00:01:31.049> pound<00:01:31.290> rail<00:01:31.590> iron<00:01:31.860> four<00:01:32.790> pounds

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
call a four pound rail iron four pounds

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.429 
call a four pound rail iron four pounds
per<00:01:33.479> foot<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> they're<00:01:34.350> eight<00:01:34.500> foot<00:01:34.829> long<00:01:36.439> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
per foot and they're eight foot long so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
per foot and they're eight foot long so
there's<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.799> thirty<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.490> pounds<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> steel

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
there's about thirty two pounds of steel

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.679 
there's about thirty two pounds of steel
right<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> spade<00:01:41.060> down<00:01:42.060> below<00:01:42.450> and

that<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.299> highly<00:01:57.299> productive<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that is highly productive it can

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
that is highly productive it can
tolerate<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.460> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.149> trellis<00:02:00.630> system

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
tolerate that kind of a trellis system

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.880 
tolerate that kind of a trellis system
and<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> fine<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.810> will<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.229> what

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and it is fine you know we will do what

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.300 
and it is fine you know we will do what
the<00:02:05.130> client<00:02:05.310> has<00:02:05.790> asked<00:02:06.240> us<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> we'll

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the client has asked us to do so we'll

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.930 
the client has asked us to do so we'll
continue<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.300> tradition<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:11.670> drip

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
continue with that tradition the drip

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
continue with that tradition the drip
system<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.750> place

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
system is in place

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
system is in place
and<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:14.129> actually<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.970> drippers<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and we actually have to drippers to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
and we actually have to drippers to
half-gallon<00:02:16.319> drippers<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.519> wire<00:02:17.940> but

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
half-gallon drippers on the wire but

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.619 
half-gallon drippers on the wire but
because<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> vines<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.680> very<00:02:19.860> small<00:02:20.629> we'll

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
because the vines are very small we'll

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.259 
because the vines are very small we'll
take<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:23.160> dripper<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.700> furthest<00:02:24.120> away

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
take the the dripper the furthest away

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.869 
take the the dripper the furthest away
from<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.170> vine<00:02:25.830> that's<00:02:26.099> going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.430> planted

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
from the vine that's going to be planted

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.670 
from the vine that's going to be planted
and<00:02:27.030> actually<00:02:27.330> run<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> spaghetti<00:02:27.870> tube<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and actually run a spaghetti tube but

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.960 
and actually run a spaghetti tube but
it's<00:02:28.800> called<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> spaghetti<00:02:29.400> tube<00:02:29.640> quarter

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
it's called the spaghetti tube quarter

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.479 
it's called the spaghetti tube quarter
inch<00:02:30.120> tube<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.810> bring<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.860> down<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.340> when

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
inch tube and just bring it down so when

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.910 
inch tube and just bring it down so when
the<00:02:32.610> water<00:02:32.790> comes<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:34.200> dripper<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.769> now

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the water comes on this dripper is now

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
the water comes on this dripper is now
functioning<00:02:35.700> over<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> period<00:02:37.019> of

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
functioning over here for a period of

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.619 
functioning over here for a period of
time<00:02:37.410> maybe<00:02:37.709> four<00:02:38.069> or<00:02:38.099> five<00:02:38.190> months<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:39.480> make

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
time maybe four or five months to make

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.089 
time maybe four or five months to make
sure<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.230> vine<00:02:40.410> actually<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.890> getting

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
sure that this vine actually is getting

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.930 
sure that this vine actually is getting
water<00:02:41.400> plus<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:42.000> dripper<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.900> kind<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.379> a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
water plus this dripper here kind of a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.890 
water plus this dripper here kind of a
insurance<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.239> make<00:02:45.390> sure<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.750> we're

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
insurance just to make sure that we're

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.600 
insurance just to make sure that we're
getting<00:02:46.019> water<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.130> definitely<00:02:47.489> don't

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
getting water so we definitely don't

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.420 
getting water so we definitely don't
want<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.940> leave<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.709> dripper<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
want to leave a a dripper here for the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.789 
want to leave a a dripper here for the
long<00:02:50.670> term<00:02:51.120> because<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.319> create<00:02:52.500> other

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
long term because you can create other

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.640 
long term because you can create other
problems<00:02:53.099> like<00:02:53.400> rot<00:02:54.239> within<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.019> vine<00:02:55.290> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
problems like rot within the vine and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.180 
problems like rot within the vine and
then<00:02:56.579> they<00:02:56.700> encourage<00:02:57.290> growers<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.470> always

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
then they encourage growers to always

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.819 
then they encourage growers to always
have<00:02:59.790> their<00:03:00.030> drippers<00:03:00.510> spaced<00:03:01.170> away<00:03:01.590> from

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
have their drippers spaced away from

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.500 
have their drippers spaced away from
their<00:03:01.980> vines<00:03:02.220> encourage<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.879> roots<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.299> move

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
their vines encourage the roots to move

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.770 
their vines encourage the roots to move
away<00:03:03.690> from<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.950> trunks<00:03:05.370> incorporate<00:03:06.120> search

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
away from the trunks incorporate search

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.050 
away from the trunks incorporate search
out<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.230> loop<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.769> space<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:08.849> we

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
out in that loop that space because we

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.789 
out in that loop that space because we
know<00:03:09.180> underground<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.900> drippers<00:03:10.319> over<00:03:10.560> time

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799

make<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.069> huge<00:03:11.700> basketball<00:03:12.690> shaped<00:03:14.239> area<00:03:15.239> of

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
make a huge basketball shaped area of

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.170 
make a huge basketball shaped area of
wetted<00:03:16.049> soil<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.980> looks<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.400> an<00:03:17.579> onion<00:03:17.910> shaped

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
wetted soil it looks on an onion shaped

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.180 
wetted soil it looks on an onion shaped
basketball<00:03:19.019> shape<00:03:19.260> whatever<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.859> want<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
basketball shape whatever you want to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.729 
basketball shape whatever you want to
use<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.569> whole<00:03:21.780> idea<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.380> we

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
use so that's the whole idea is that we

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.729 
use so that's the whole idea is that we
don't<00:03:22.950> want<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.989> saturated<00:03:24.989> position

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
don't want to have a saturated position

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.319 
don't want to have a saturated position
here<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> hundred<00:03:26.579> percent<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> time

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
here a hundred percent of the time

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.449 
here a hundred percent of the time
through<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> whole<00:03:27.930> life<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.410> vine<00:03:28.680> so

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
through the whole life of the vine so

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.910 
through the whole life of the vine so
again<00:03:29.819> spaghetti<00:03:30.660> tube<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.709> temporary

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
again spaghetti tube is just a temporary

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.349 
again spaghetti tube is just a temporary
tube<00:03:34.920> that's<00:03:35.220> there<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.670> we'll<00:03:35.849> take<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.209> off

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
tube that's there and we'll take it off

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.849 
tube that's there and we'll take it off
before<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.139> end<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.440> growing<00:03:37.620> season

before the end of the growing season
this<00:03:38.310> year<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:39.000> allow<00:03:39.599> those<00:03:39.959> lines<00:03:40.260> that

important<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.980> when<00:03:53.310> we<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.669> dig<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
important is that when we do dig the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.120 
important is that when we do dig the
holes<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.900> want<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.200> make<00:03:55.290> sure<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.650> holes<00:03:55.889> are

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
holes we want to make sure the holes are

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.900 
holes we want to make sure the holes are
deep<00:03:56.310> enough<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.940> soil<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.870> viable<00:03:58.430> loose<00:03:59.430> not

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
deep enough the soil is viable loose not

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.990 
deep enough the soil is viable loose not
compacted<00:04:00.630> hard<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:02.310> we<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.609> actually

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
compacted hard and that we have actually

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.740 
compacted hard and that we have actually
got<00:04:03.919> the<00:04:04.919> hole<00:04:05.130> deep<00:04:05.370> enough<00:04:05.669> but<00:04:06.180> also<00:04:06.209> that

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
got the hole deep enough but also that

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.960 
got the hole deep enough but also that
they<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:06.959> dug<00:04:07.349> very<00:04:07.560> close<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.519> either<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
they have dug very close to either the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.659 
they have dug very close to either the
training<00:04:09.450> rod<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.079> training<00:04:10.560> steak<00:04:10.950> the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
training rod the training steak the

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.150 
training rod the training steak the
t-post<00:04:12.269> or<00:04:12.690> whatever<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.319> vine<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.769> actually

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
t-post or whatever the vine is actually

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.990 
t-post or whatever the vine is actually
going<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.400> be<00:04:14.930> trained<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.849> can

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
going to be trained up to and you can

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.580 
going to be trained up to and you can
see<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.359> even<00:04:18.539> with<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.959> planting<00:04:19.440> they're

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
see that even with the planting they're

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.279 
see that even with the planting they're
planting<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.160> vine<00:04:20.430> as<00:04:21.209> close<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.959> rod

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
planting that vine as close to this rod

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.870 
planting that vine as close to this rod
as<00:04:22.500> possible<00:04:22.860> I'm<00:04:22.919> not<00:04:23.070> putting<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.400> out<00:04:23.520> here

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
as possible I'm not putting it out here

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.060 
as possible I'm not putting it out here
they're<00:04:24.030> not<00:04:24.120> putting<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.510> everywhere

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
they're not putting it everywhere

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.880 
they're not putting it everywhere
I<00:04:25.130> know<00:04:25.760> some<00:04:26.240> people<00:04:26.270> put<00:04:26.870> in<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.140> vines<00:04:27.380> and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
I know some people put in the vines and

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.890 
I know some people put in the vines and
then<00:04:28.580> they<00:04:28.730> come<00:04:28.910> back<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.270> put<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.420> trellis

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
then they come back and put the trellis

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.080 
then they come back and put the trellis
system<00:04:30.080> in<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.400> means<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.760> vine<00:04:31.940> could

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
system in but that means the vine could

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.340 
system in but that means the vine could
be<00:04:32.180> over<00:04:32.330> here<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.690> trellis<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.140> over

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
be over here and the trellis is over

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.170 
be over here and the trellis is over
there<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.830> sometimes<00:04:34.370> that<00:04:34.490> really<00:04:34.850> doesn't

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
there and sometimes that really doesn't

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.480 
there and sometimes that really doesn't
work<00:04:35.330> out<00:04:35.540> too<00:04:35.780> well<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.350> long<00:04:36.620> run

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
work out too well in the long run

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.310 
work out too well in the long run
because<00:04:38.240> if<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:38.510> end<00:04:38.720> up<00:04:38.840> using<00:04:39.050> some

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
because if we end up using some

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.100 
because if we end up using some
mechanical<00:04:39.890> equipment<00:04:40.310> underneath<00:04:40.960> dome<00:04:41.960> on

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
mechanical equipment underneath dome on

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.590 
mechanical equipment underneath dome on
the<00:04:42.320> trellis<00:04:42.740> wires<00:04:43.010> here<00:04:43.610> one<00:04:44.300> thing<00:04:44.450> we

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
the trellis wires here one thing we

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.000 
the trellis wires here one thing we
don't<00:04:44.750> want<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.110> have<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.410> do<00:04:45.560> is<00:04:45.740> worry<00:04:45.950> about

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
don't want to have to do is worry about

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.860 
don't want to have to do is worry about
trunks<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:46.880> parts<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.390> vines<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.780> are

trunks and parts of the vines that are

too far away and what you can get
