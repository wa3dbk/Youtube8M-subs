00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.250
 Eh, everyone is Hi Ohori, though 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:16.630
 That the recommendation of a long time of Ahu tree 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.900
 Coloring from the so basic story from the so-so 207 series about the American acoustic guitar 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.980
 I wonder if you have any questions about gums 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.160
 Well, I hope Do not the kind of memories if you can eliminate 104 th of Apu 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.640
 I want to do it, but in that there has been a bit of a short mark in sight 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.230
 It 's a festival of salmon that you can hardly get with things 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:43.129
 Kodaka I'd version s It is this time that we have got a uni-product 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.940
 After all, the Tteyuu lightness and weight of the sound of the Tteyuu heaviness of lightness is of this guitar when still 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.970
 We decided 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.030
 Talk to say or not it 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.890
 I'm going to spec this time but I think it was a bit hard to understand 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.570
 Of course it's also a guitar, for example, it's a seat for the body too, but it's also necessary to have a big size 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 Say something or something 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 Or it is plywood specification or it is not to say that weight in single-plate specification group changes 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.710
 Though 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.989
 Do not forget Yaba wants the must not forget Well say until more deep 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.810
 When 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:15.310
 But the fact that the weight of the agent itself is also related 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:21.369
 I don't think that's what it means that just saying this gives Gibson j 45 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.610
 Side back is painted black but I was mahogany and say something 45 when the chrysanthemum but is 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.750
 It may be a bit hard to see because 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.660
 A little side bag is magic magic It's a grandchild and this is either 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.680
 It is said that it is a bad agent or this 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.370
 I have talked several times with the video before this 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.000
 Also I'm a not a like a element is suppressed the cost performance and rather 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.110
 But 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.630
 It is only the sideback royal road to the end of the class , so this is commonplace 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.930
 I did not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.580
 Hmm 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.060
 For example, when I stroke, I can understand why it is light 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.060
 moon 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.220
 me 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.649
 me 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.649
 me 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.970
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.970
 me 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.810
 me 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.750
 me 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.500
 me 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 yeah 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.380
 Well this only One I But you know I'd think I do not know after all that weight is very light 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.850
 Just sound 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.480
 In any case, it 's the second time you got it 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.310
 gibson j 45 was or hummingbird degree of I's right 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.930
 What what is say very Gibson acoustic guitar ness of using intact are out well 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.490
 It feels like that 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:54.870
 Is not in Well of course I that regularly something of course that of course there is no amount that has been highlighted 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:58.080
 Light that it Well provisional clogging when door Nekou articulate that which way do I thought I'd 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:03.390
 Some say that Carmina sounds very much like exercise 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:07.950
 Well agent Given so why is I come is either made to have bad if after all its own way 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.840
 To look to Iiii on whether e 3 Tteyuu light sound of Tteyuu high curl Now comes out sounds like 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.400
 It feels like it's supposed to come out 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.860
 After all there is a part where it is good that it is good but it comes out 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 There is 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.630
 Yes but yes 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.890
 And here I Toka or was I ne Well recording 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:29.480
 Here each use sometimes say and say the guitar is the other domestic This 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.190
 I think it is famous during Lizards, but this is yamaha so the mountain is Yuru- san or gx 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.120
 Though it's such that say 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.600
 Well this is it you but such as this I this side bag is not to introduce another indescribably 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.940
 Really beautiful eyes 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.060
 Te rosewood, which is produced in bra gdr much Brazil has become it from I do timed 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.099
 I'm phraseology 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.970
 In other words, I mean, Rose and my friends, and finally Rose and the highest peak. 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:55.270
 Well now I can not take it anymore, but take Burrows in particular 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:01.030
 Very I do this heavy and become Toka Jacaranda 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.989
 It has a this heavy weight is only even Tsu very rose with a heavy dosage of'm elbow 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.050
 accident 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.290
 Feeling that comes with Doshin 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.190
 There is a free port mother even if there is a weight or nothing but a double guba heavy 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.900
 It is called sound 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:20.030
 A good child is admiring what it is like an attack that has a solid effect 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:23.070
 I said earlier that it was a light sound, but it's a light sound, and that one of them 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.150
 I have a good bite, but it is also here Torretta 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.660
 Set aside unlike the sound around the It is obtained 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.560
 Kedomo low is much'm such not come out there even if Las standing to become very oa 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.430
 I'm to 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.430
 There 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.130
 Great 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.020
 car 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.499
 wh 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.120
 me 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:52.510
 Good morning 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.680
 wh 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.460
 uh yeah 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.460
 me 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:08.140
 Originally It is just Junko Yamaha's uniqueness to just make a delicate sound of yamaha 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:14.830
 Rutte I feel I'm a not also but would anyway heavy 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.320
 There is a strong impression that if the agent is added, it will make it sound like it has a profound feeling. 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.790
 Right? 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:25.470
 That thing is that at first I used a rosewood side bag as a headache. 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.280
 It had almost no chance of using the thing is I Oh other equipment massaging Do I were many 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.360
 Though 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.930
 The Tteyuu Toka's j 45 of like a Gibson just now is out to use the things of Gibson 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.340
 Teasing 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.310
 Very ne this also but I started from where Tteyuu after all Do I light sound comes out 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.910
 With that rose 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.660
 Of course there are also some different questions when you ask 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:50.710
 I said I thought so but also is a do of course, that the left and right sound so went so 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:55.630
 By the way, the weight prefecture at that time is probably almost light now or heavy 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.330
 There is a sentence that whether it is proportional to something with or without feeling 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.930
 Tax beginning 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.800
 Of course it is not only that I just said the size of the body 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.909
 Or 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.229
 If the story features of wood itself are different 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:12.349
 It just also of course there is also of course Tteyuu to come at all different wood 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:16.320
 Of course it is also a fact that it is not to be decided 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:21.450
 I 'm just going to use a variety of leaders and after all guitar 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:25.400
 It is also light in a sense that there is a solid feeling of sound if something like that already happens 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:28.430
 Such an impression Iraq should not come out to 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:33.710
 I think it seems that the number of things has increased 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:39.440
 Well thing called or was not well the weight of sin that only is not it'll ne well that it 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:43.100
 When the returns and I wonder if proportional to the thing called or rather a profound feeling or lightness of the sound 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.420
 I thought it but you will find a recently I 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.200
 Yes, I will see you again 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:52.590
 It is also now also everyone I think because like to continue Ogino recommend more and more 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.850
 I want to please treat lantern's thank you 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:59.330
 It is see you than I was there a wiki 23 that I'll see you next time raw that 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.330
 If it is good
