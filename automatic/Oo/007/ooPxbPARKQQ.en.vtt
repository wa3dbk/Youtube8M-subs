the invisibility could be incredibly

the invisibility could be incredibly
annoying<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.150> fight<00:02:14.360> against<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:14.930> always<00:02:15.140> try

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
annoying to fight against so always try

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.200

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
and keep a sharp eye out in the corner

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.360 
and keep a sharp eye out in the corner
of<00:02:17.240> your<00:02:17.330> screen<00:02:17.630> make<00:02:18.410> sure<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.680> know<00:02:19.070> where
