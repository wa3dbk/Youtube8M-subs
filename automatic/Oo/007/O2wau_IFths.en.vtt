00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:05.720
 In this video you will learn to draw a spiral of semicircles 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.530
 First, a Hills just refer to the sheet 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.899
 she helps and later 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.899
 then draw circles 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.509
 then draw Dr in the middle of this 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.759
 these hills get two centers for 1 and in the open 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 they should have a distance 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.369
 have a half to two inches 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.240
 here the distance is smaller 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.360
 of these two points is 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
 the closer we get our players 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.400
 Change the MByte of a second or third drawing the distances of the centers 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.110
 and watch 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 how the spirals change 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.620
 the radius of the first half is the same 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.690
 like the distance between the two centers 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.570
 the tip of the circle therefore pierces the first center m 1 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.080
 top 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 m 1 a jump-off 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.260
 Ziercke thighs with the pencil Miene 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.770
 must touch the second midpoint in 2 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.540
 make a little bit longer 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.710
 Pichler 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.770
 from a 2 we start a semicircle 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 around the first center m 1 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.400
 to draw 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.070
 the semicircle ends 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.470
 now advised 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 Lopar 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 Milan Ziercke in two days 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.139
 we adapt to the radios 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.259
 Daun 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.049
 the pencil's face 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.949
 must touch the end of the semicircle 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.339
 the panel of the semicircle targets 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.519
 the pencil would be left behind 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.519
 then draw a semicircle around Pants 2 Â» 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.069
 again until the 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.069
 Welsleben 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 like DMM once a jump-off 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.589
 the pencil mien of a spiral laying hands 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
 a semicircle around the at 1 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.079
 to

 Image beaten for him 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 in which two pierce 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.349
 adjust the radius again 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.609
 SOA and all radios invert 2 to 11 loving ones 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.109
 Insert in m1 Adjust radios 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.459
 circle 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.459
 to the highest level 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.169
 while beating at the 2 1 sting 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.039
 Palmer around 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:53.789
