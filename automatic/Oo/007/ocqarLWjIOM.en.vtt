00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
chrome and then we added the green

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.400 
chrome and then we added the green
outline<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.050> really<00:01:13.200> thought

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
outline to it which we really thought

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.200 
outline to it which we really thought
made<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> pup<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.490> match<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> facemask

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
made a pup to match the facemask

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
made a pup to match the facemask
hydrographics<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.170> dip<00:01:16.320> our<00:01:16.440> face<00:01:16.619> mask<00:01:16.890> as

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
hydrographics will dip our face mask as

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370 
hydrographics will dip our face mask as
well<00:01:17.270> which<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.510> first<00:01:18.780> time<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.290> us

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
well which will be a first time for us

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
well which will be a first time for us
to<00:01:19.800> have<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> face<00:01:20.310> mask<00:01:20.580> done<00:01:21.270> by

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to have the face mask done by

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.380 
to have the face mask done by
hydrographics<00:01:22.790> really<00:01:23.790> we're<00:01:23.940> able<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> tie

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390

in<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> Shamrock<00:01:25.259> after<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.740> saw<00:01:25.950> what

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
in with the Shamrock after we saw what

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.830 
in with the Shamrock after we saw what
adidas<00:01:26.460> came<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> concept<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
adidas came up with with the concept of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
adidas came up with with the concept of
putting<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> shamrock<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> jersey<00:01:29.729> and

putting the shamrock on the jersey and
the<00:01:29.910> pant<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.869> made<00:01:31.050> sense<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.410> put<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> green

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the pant it made sense to put the green

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.260 
the pant it made sense to put the green
outline<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.400> helmet<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> all

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
outline on the helmet so that it all

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.570 
outline on the helmet so that it all
kind<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> tied<00:01:33.750> together<00:01:34.009> our<00:01:35.009> typical

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
kind of tied together our typical

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.940 
kind of tied together our typical
