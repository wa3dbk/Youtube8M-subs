00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.760
 I 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.710
 yop legend it's mostly what we 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.059
 finds himself for a new glitch that 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 shows you how to get to our streets in 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.239
 do not bag anything and English so life 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.210
 of the prologue 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.559
 after the update 1.08 or for that 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.260
 do it's very simple to press it on 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.329
 your and you're going that I tend 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.950
 replay mission is actually you go 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.950
 look for the burial head mission 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.410
 and so you have found it you the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.330
 start immediately and so as soon as 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.700
 you accept the mission you spend the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.870
 cinematic his plans to do it and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690
 so then you go by the mission 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.320
 in fact until you come to 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.960
 northampton and as soon as you get in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 orient stone bah you go so far 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.860
 the end of the mission point is therefore 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 as soon as you arrive in the village 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.620
 when you go to ask a friend of you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.020
 invite and you actually stop 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.460
 a few meters before the cemetery because 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.990
 that it does not work anywhere else you can 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.760
 you stop there I think it works 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.870
 but better be sure that you are going 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.190

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.790
 why are not you going exactly 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 good window on the surroundings 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.740
 you have to be really close to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 cemetery in fact for it to work I 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 do not know why the other sides when 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.020
 you are in another place that 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.100
 not in any case it worked 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.300
 not it works on your side you can 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.560
 try to put yourself a little bit 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.330
 where in russia as it works 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 I do not let me know about them 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 comments that you are going to place yourself 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.770
 there and you will accept the request 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.770
 from your friend 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.660

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.640
 no 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.620
 and so after having the load of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.960
 50 years old you are going to go take a 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.600
 does not make a boat since in fact lille 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.010
 is in the air and so to find out if 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.470

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.550

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.850
