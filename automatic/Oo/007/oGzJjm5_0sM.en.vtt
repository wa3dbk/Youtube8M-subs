company because it's not i'm just using

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.920 
company because it's not i'm just using
like<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.080> new<00:02:19.319> controller<00:02:19.709> because<00:02:20.040> my

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
like this new controller because my

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.320 
like this new controller because my
scuff<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.590> working<00:02:23.069> how<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.580> should<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
scuff is not working how it should and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.780 
scuff is not working how it should and
it'll<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.959> fixed<00:02:25.349> but<00:02:25.530> since<00:02:26.489> it's<00:02:26.640> been<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
it'll be fixed but since it's been a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.500 
it'll be fixed but since it's been a
week<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:28.310> think<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.580> might<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.879> stick

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
week now and I think I might just stick

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.240 
week now and I think I might just stick
to<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.720> normal<00:02:30.780> controller<00:02:31.379> like<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.010> said<00:02:32.069> I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
to the normal controller like I said I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.570 
to the normal controller like I said I
don't<00:02:32.640> feel<00:02:32.879> anything<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.299> wrong<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
don't feel anything is wrong with it and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.000 
don't feel anything is wrong with it and
I<00:02:35.580> love<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.540> enjoy<00:02:36.900> using<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.680> really

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
I love and I enjoy using it it's really

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100

there's<00:02:38.819> something<00:02:38.910> about<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.780> using<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
there's something about just using a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.690 
there's something about just using a
normal<00:02:40.290> controller<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.489> gets

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
normal controller that really just gets

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.220 
normal controller that really just gets
