brakes<00:00:15.470> with<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> new<00:00:16.680> season<00:00:16.920> rolling

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
brakes with the new season rolling

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.710 
brakes with the new season rolling
around<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.699> might<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.970> noticed<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> your

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
around you might have noticed that your

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.660 
around you might have noticed that your
when<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.619> pull<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:20.010> brake<00:00:20.189> levers<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
when you pull your brake levers that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
when you pull your brake levers that
it's<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.300> tight<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.869> used<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it's not as tight as it used to be and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.000 
it's not as tight as it used to be and
there's<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.460> simple<00:00:23.850> way<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> resolve<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.010> now

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
there's a simple way to resolve that now

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
there's a simple way to resolve that now
this<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> road<00:00:26.820> bike<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.900> most

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
this right here is a road bike but most

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
this right here is a road bike but most
all<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> brakes<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.640> called<00:00:29.789> B<00:00:29.970> brakes

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
all the brakes these are called B brakes

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
all the brakes these are called B brakes
they<00:00:31.199> had<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.650> switch<00:00:31.920> right<00:00:32.250> here

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
they had this little switch right here

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.810 
they had this little switch right here
and<00:00:32.759> you'll<00:00:33.690> notice<00:00:33.899> when<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> open<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.820> that

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and you'll notice when I open that that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.930 
and you'll notice when I open that that
the<00:00:35.969> brakes<00:00:36.210> go<00:00:36.480> further<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.940> from

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the brakes go further out from the from

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.520 
the brakes go further out from the from
the<00:00:39.059> tires<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.500> sure

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the tires so you want to make sure

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.799 
the tires so you want to make sure
that's<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> most<00:00:41.610> open<00:00:42.030> position<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
that's in the most open position and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.950 
that's in the most open position and
then<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.620> use<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:45.270> hex<00:00:45.480> key<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
then you can use a little hex key that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
then you can use a little hex key that
will<00:00:46.020> fit<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> loosen<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
will fit in there to loosen that up and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
will fit in there to loosen that up and
at<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.329> point<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> time<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> wire<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.500> going

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
at that point in time the wire is going

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.340 
at that point in time the wire is going
to<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.850> taut<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> want<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
to be not as taut so you want to have

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
to be not as taut so you want to have
this<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.640> said<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.969> want<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.390> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
this as I said you want to have it in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.619 
this as I said you want to have it in
the<00:00:55.489> extended<00:00:56.489> position<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> brake

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the extended position so that the brake

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.150 
the extended position so that the brake
pads<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.050> further<00:00:58.320> away<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.739> wheel<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
pads are further away from the wheel and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
pads are further away from the wheel and
just<00:00:59.370> again<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> illustrate<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.539> you'll<00:01:01.260> see

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
just again to illustrate that you'll see

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
just again to illustrate that you'll see
when<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> push<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.539> there's<00:01:03.539> less<00:01:03.899> room

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
when I push down there's less room

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530 
when I push down there's less room
between<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.769> wheel<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.850> brake<00:01:06.090> pad<00:01:06.299> now

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
between the wheel and the brake pad now

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
between the wheel and the brake pad now
when<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.750> pull<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.729> there's<00:01:08.729> more

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
when I pull this back up there's more

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
when I pull this back up there's more
room<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.229> important<00:01:10.740> because<00:01:10.770> when

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
room and that's important because when

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
room and that's important because when
you're<00:01:11.280> tightening<00:01:11.630> your<00:01:12.650> your<00:01:13.650> brakes

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
you're tightening your your brakes

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
you're tightening your your brakes
because<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.430> them<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:15.450> only<00:01:15.659> break

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
because you want them to not only break

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
because you want them to not only break
more<00:01:16.920> firmly<00:01:17.310> when<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> pull<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> brake

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
more firmly when you pull the brake

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600 
more firmly when you pull the brake
lever<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.710> it'll<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.130> it'll<00:01:20.280> help<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
lever but it'll you know it'll help you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.070 
lever but it'll you know it'll help you
to<00:01:20.700> stop<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.240> faster<00:01:21.659> because<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.020> gets

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to stop a lot faster because if it gets

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.830 
to stop a lot faster because if it gets
too<00:01:22.229> loose<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.759> post<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.689> if

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
too loose you can post a little bit if

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
too loose you can post a little bit if
you<00:01:24.900> having<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> stop<00:01:25.350> quickly<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.250> could

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you having to stop quickly it could

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.730 
you having to stop quickly it could
really<00:01:26.580> pose<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> problem<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.560> in

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
really pose a problem so have that in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.310 
really pose a problem so have that in
the<00:01:28.829> most<00:01:28.979> outward<00:01:29.670> position<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.140> brake

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the most outward position so your brake

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.310 
the most outward position so your brake
pads<00:01:31.470> far<00:01:31.829> away<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> wheel<00:01:33.140> loosen<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
pads far away from the wheel loosen this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.420 
pads far away from the wheel loosen this
with<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> hex<00:01:34.770> key<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:36.090> pull<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
with a hex key and then pull this I

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
with a hex key and then pull this I
pulled<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.610> wire<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.840> pull<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> up

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
pulled this wire down and pull that up

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
pulled this wire down and pull that up
and<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.600> tight<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and just get it as tight as you want to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.460 
and just get it as tight as you want to
screw<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:46.020> pop<00:01:46.229> this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
screw that back in and then pop this

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.780 
screw that back in and then pop this
back<00:01:46.710> over<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.159> there's<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> good<00:01:47.549> possibility

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
back over now there's a good possibility

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.510 
back over now there's a good possibility
that<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.500> may<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.740> gotten<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.100> too<00:01:50.250> tight

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that you may have gotten it too tight

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.480 
that you may have gotten it too tight
you<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> leave<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> room

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
you want to leave a little bit of room
