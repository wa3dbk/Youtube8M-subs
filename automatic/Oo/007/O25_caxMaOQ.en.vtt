okay<00:00:01.709> I'm<00:00:01.920> revisiting<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.939> circuit<00:00:03.510> that

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
okay I'm revisiting a circuit that

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay I'm revisiting a circuit that
Johnny<00:00:04.020> devreau<00:00:04.580> started<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:06.150> whole<00:00:06.420> thread

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
Johnny devreau started the whole thread

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.240 
Johnny devreau started the whole thread
on<00:00:07.460> way<00:00:08.460> back<00:00:08.820> when<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:10.019> was<00:00:10.230> his<00:00:10.440> panel

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
on way back when and it was his panel

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.120 
on way back when and it was his panel
ater<00:00:11.670> or<00:00:12.000> aluminum<00:00:12.509> tray<00:00:12.809> oscillator<00:00:13.380> where

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
ater or aluminum tray oscillator where

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.580 
ater or aluminum tray oscillator where
he<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.429> used<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.820> transistor<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.870> high<00:00:16.379> voltage

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
he just used a transistor a high voltage

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.490 
he just used a transistor a high voltage
trigger<00:00:17.160> coil<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.330> couple<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.869> aluminum

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
trigger coil and a couple of aluminum

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.060 
trigger coil and a couple of aluminum
pans<00:00:19.949> or<00:00:20.460> trays<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> feedback

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
pans or trays and they got a feedback

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.980 
pans or trays and they got a feedback
going<00:00:23.490> here<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> trigger<00:00:24.300> coil<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
going here with the trigger coil and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.769 
going here with the trigger coil and
made<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.980> these<00:00:26.070> exciter<00:00:26.880> circuits<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
made one of these exciter circuits and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960 
made one of these exciter circuits and
this<00:00:27.930> was<00:00:28.140> Johnny<00:00:28.439> Davos<00:00:28.949> panic<00:00:29.400> cider<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this was Johnny Davos panic cider so I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.659 
this was Johnny Davos panic cider so I
really<00:00:30.330> looked<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.529> did<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> few<00:00:32.610> things

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
really looked at it did a few things

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.319 
really looked at it did a few things
that<00:00:33.120> I've<00:00:33.270> learned<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.989> came<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:35.329> that

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that I've learned and came up with that

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.650 
that I've learned and came up with that
right<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.090> worked<00:00:39.480> out

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
right there and this actually worked out

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
right there and this actually worked out
really<00:00:39.989> really<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> trigger

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
really really well and it's the trigger

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.900 
really really well and it's the trigger
coil<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> instead<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.129> using<00:00:44.340> trays<00:00:44.879> or

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
coil but instead of using trays or

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.450 
coil but instead of using trays or
Luminum<00:00:45.539> pans<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.559> getting<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> feedback

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
Luminum pans I'm just getting a feedback

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
Luminum pans I'm just getting a feedback
right<00:00:47.730> off<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.180> coil<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.020> 10k

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
right off of the coil that's a 10k

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.540 
right off of the coil that's a 10k
voltar<00:00:50.820> coil<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:52.260> transistor<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> added<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
voltar coil one transistor I added a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
voltar coil one transistor I added a
couple<00:00:53.699> other<00:00:54.000> parts<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.750> there's<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
couple other parts here there's the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
couple other parts here there's the
circuit<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:58.190> don't<00:00:59.190> send<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.760> my<00:00:59.940> circuits

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
circuit and I don't send out my circuits

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
circuit and I don't send out my circuits
and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:01.020> post<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.649> anymore<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.309> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and I don't post them anymore I just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
and I don't post them anymore I just
have<00:01:03.180> these<00:01:03.329> videos<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.080> take<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> look<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.890> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
have these videos so take a look at this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
have these videos so take a look at this
and<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> should<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.939> able<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.330> copy<00:01:06.689> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

take<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> picture<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.729> calling

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
take a picture of it that I'm calling

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
take a picture of it that I'm calling
this<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.600> Johnny<00:01:13.049> lid<00:01:13.380> motor<00:01:13.650> exciter

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this the Johnny lid motor exciter

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
this the Johnny lid motor exciter
circuit<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.250> extremely<00:01:18.180> simple

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
circuit and it's a extremely simple

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
circuit and it's a extremely simple
that's<00:01:19.159> Johnny's<00:01:20.159> original<00:01:20.759> idea<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.270> make

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's Johnny's original idea was make

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.130 
that's Johnny's original idea was make
this<00:01:21.659> thing<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.080> simple<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
this thing really simple and there it is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.499 
this thing really simple and there it is
not<00:01:25.140> much<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.640> put<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.150> board

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
not much to it that I put it on board

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.740 
not much to it that I put it on board
and<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:29.220> actually<00:01:29.490> works<00:01:29.850> quite<00:01:30.210> well<00:01:30.270> I'm

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and it actually works quite well I'm

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
and it actually works quite well I'm
going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> hear<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> double<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> battery<00:01:32.210> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
going to hear off a double a battery and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.230 
going to hear off a double a battery and
a<00:01:33.840> dozen<00:01:34.380> LEDs<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.520> it'll<00:01:35.759> light<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:35.939> all

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
a dozen LEDs but it'll light up all

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
a dozen LEDs but it'll light up all
kinds<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.750> things<00:01:36.960> depending<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> voltage

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
kinds of things depending on the voltage

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.719 
kinds of things depending on the voltage
you<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> self<00:01:40.320> resonating<00:01:41.189> self

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you do it's a self resonating self

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
you do it's a self resonating self
oscillating<00:01:42.420> circuit<00:01:42.659> there's<00:01:42.990> no<00:01:43.170> tuning<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
oscillating circuit there's no tuning to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.330 
oscillating circuit there's no tuning to
it<00:01:43.950> except<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> coil<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it except for this coil and I got this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.359 
it except for this coil and I got this
idea<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.630> slayer<00:01:49.079> exciter<00:01:49.590> experiments

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
idea from a slayer exciter experiments

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.030 
idea from a slayer exciter experiments
where<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.590> primary<00:01:52.590> coil

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
where they have that primary coil

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.789 
where they have that primary coil
movable<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.780> secondary<00:01:55.380> coil

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
movable up and down the secondary coil

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
movable up and down the secondary coil
now<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> heck<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.360> might<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.600> well

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
now that what the heck I might as well

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
now that what the heck I might as well
try<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.710> worked<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.729> an

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
try it on this and it worked and it's an

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.179 
try it on this and it worked and it's an
open-ended<00:02:00.450> coil<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.950> right<00:02:02.159> there

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
open-ended coil you see it right there

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
open-ended coil you see it right there
there's<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> coil<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> feedback<00:02:04.079> loop

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
there's the coil for the feedback loop

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.069 
there's the coil for the feedback loop
to<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> base<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> transistor<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.509> it's

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
going you can really disconnect that and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080 
going you can really disconnect that and
the<00:02:22.050> feedback<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.740> keeps<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.160> going<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.970> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the feedback just keeps on going but it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.700 
the feedback just keeps on going but it

see<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> light<00:02:48.030> LED<00:02:48.570> right<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.380> now

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
see the light LED right there and now

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.729 
see the light LED right there and now
here's<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> dozen<00:02:51.360> LEDs<00:02:52.110> now<00:02:52.320> these<00:02:52.470> are<00:02:52.680> in

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
here's the dozen LEDs now these are in

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.600 
here's the dozen LEDs now these are in

and there's the dozen LEDs lit up in

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.940 
and there's the dozen LEDs lit up in
series<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.989> like<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.110> say<00:03:01.260> depending<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.120 
series and like I say depending on the
voltage<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.940> run<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.390> out<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
voltage that you run this out in the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.460 
voltage that you run this out in the
configuration<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:06.390> can<00:03:06.540> run<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.110> up<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
configuration you can run this on up to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.550 
configuration you can run this on up to
about<00:03:07.709> nine<00:03:08.040> volts<00:03:08.640> without<00:03:09.050> burning<00:03:10.050> up<00:03:10.320> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
about nine volts without burning up that

transistor that's Justin in PS a 06
transistor<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.980> put<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> socket<00:03:17.940> for<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
transistor I do put a socket for it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.910 
transistor I do put a socket for it
because<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.780> burn<00:03:19.049> these<00:03:19.200> things<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.739> on

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
because you burn these things up on

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.979 
because you burn these things up on
these<00:03:20.040> exciters<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.850> all<00:03:21.000> found<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.510> that

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
these exciters we all found that that

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.380 
these exciters we all found that that
out<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.650> rather<00:03:23.310> than<00:03:23.489> solder<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.299> go

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
out so rather than solder it in and go

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.759 
out so rather than solder it in and go
ahead<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.600> get<00:03:24.720> yourself<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.260> little<00:03:25.380> socket

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
ahead and get yourself a little socket

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.610 
ahead and get yourself a little socket
so<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.370> place<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.880> transistor<00:03:27.620> several

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
so you can place that transistor several

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.289 
so you can place that transistor several
of<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.739> ones<00:03:28.920> i<00:03:29.070> tried<00:03:29.400> work<00:03:29.700> there<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
of the ones i tried work there but the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.539 
of the ones i tried work there but the
NPS<00:03:30.720> al6<00:03:31.260> seems<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.709> work<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.010> best<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.340> this

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
NPS al6 seems to work the best with this

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.420 
NPS al6 seems to work the best with this
exciter<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:34.049> got<00:03:34.290> pretty<00:03:34.920> much<00:03:35.100> all<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
exciter but it's got pretty much all the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.100 
exciter but it's got pretty much all the
other<00:03:35.549> characteristics<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.720> don't<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
other characteristics I don't like the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.080 
other characteristics I don't like the
amp<00:03:37.320> draw<00:03:37.500> its<00:03:37.709> 30<00:03:37.950> amps<00:03:38.430> out<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.820> thing

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
amp draw its 30 amps out of that thing

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.910 
amp draw its 30 amps out of that thing
but<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.049> does<00:03:40.260> do<00:03:40.560> do<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.549> usual<00:03:41.820> stuff

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
but it does do do the usual stuff

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.880 
but it does do do the usual stuff
there's<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.160> high<00:03:44.340> voltage<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.390> neon<00:03:47.120> and

there's a high voltage on a neon and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.729 
there's a high voltage on a neon and
it'll<00:03:49.890> pick<00:03:50.100> up<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:53.930> high<00:03:54.930> voltage<00:03:54.959> off

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
it'll pick up the the high voltage off
