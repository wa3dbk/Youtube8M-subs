running is much faster than the version
I<00:00:54.059> had<00:00:54.210> before<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.350> 3.1<00:00:55.890> did<00:00:56.129> add<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.489> speed

of course also in the bottom right hand
corner<00:02:12.060> where<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.569> Wi-Fi<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
corner where your Wi-Fi is that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.949 
corner where your Wi-Fi is that
and<00:02:14.190> actually<00:02:14.340> has<00:02:14.580> little<00:02:14.879> arrows<00:02:15.540> going<00:02:15.569> up

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and actually has little arrows going up

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.149 
and actually has little arrows going up
and<00:02:16.110> down<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.590> downloading<00:02:16.830> or

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
and down if you're downloading or

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.550 
and down if you're downloading or
uploading<00:02:17.190> files<00:02:18.110> doesn't<00:02:19.110> make<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> huge

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
uploading files doesn't make a huge

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.720 
uploading files doesn't make a huge
difference<00:02:19.769> but<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.129> can<00:02:20.250> always<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.610> what

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
difference but you can always see what

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.220 
difference but you can always see what
your<00:02:20.879> what<00:02:21.120> your<00:02:21.180> internet<00:02:21.659> connection<00:02:21.690> is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
your what your internet connection is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
your what your internet connection is
doing<00:02:22.560> that's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.310> really<00:02:23.519> cool<00:02:23.730> thing<00:02:23.970> that's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
doing that's a really cool thing that's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.059 
doing that's a really cool thing that's
really<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:25.260> main<00:02:25.290> things<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.890> see

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
really the main things that I see

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.500 
really the main things that I see
another<00:02:26.670> thing<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.120> do<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.450> can

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
another thing that you can do you can

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.960 
another thing that you can do you can
actually<00:02:27.720> resize<00:02:28.230> widgets<00:02:28.590> any<00:02:29.040> widget<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
actually resize widgets any widget that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.050 
actually resize widgets any widget that
is<00:02:30.299> compatible<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:31.640> what<00:02:32.640> they're<00:02:32.760> saying<00:02:32.970> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
is compatible now what they're saying it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.240 
is compatible now what they're saying it
though<00:02:33.180> at<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.629> at<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.470> Google<00:02:34.799> conference

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
though at the at the Google conference

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.550 
though at the at the Google conference
they're<00:02:35.430> saying<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.329> can<00:02:36.510> actually<00:02:36.690> do

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
they're saying that you can actually do

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.410 
they're saying that you can actually do
this<00:02:37.620> by<00:02:38.159> adding<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.670> line<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.819> code<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.120> any

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
this by adding one line of code to any

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.930 
this by adding one line of code to any
existing<00:02:39.900> application<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.400> example<00:02:41.489> if

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
existing application so for example if

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.030 
existing application so for example if
you<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.510> application<00:02:43.409> developer<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:43.920> add

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
you are application developer you add

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.250 
you are application developer you add
this<00:02:44.190> one<00:02:44.400> line<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.239> predefined<00:02:46.019> line

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this one line this one predefined line

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.619 
this one line this one predefined line
to<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:46.890> code<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.849> good<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.239> go<00:02:48.359> and

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
to your code you are good to go and

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.080 
to your code you are good to go and
actually<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.040> element<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:50.910> there

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
actually as the as the element in there

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.849 
actually as the as the element in there
without<00:02:51.540> doing<00:02:51.959> anything<00:02:52.140> else<00:02:52.349> really<00:02:52.620> cool

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
without doing anything else really cool

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.589 
without doing anything else really cool
so<00:02:53.310> enough<00:02:53.790> talking<00:02:53.819> let<00:02:54.269> me<00:02:54.329> actually<00:02:54.450> show
