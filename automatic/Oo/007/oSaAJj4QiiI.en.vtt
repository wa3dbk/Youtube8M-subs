two and step three and you have to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
two and step three and you have to
follow<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> through<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.050> didn't<00:00:49.050> wash<00:00:49.200> off

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
follow it through and I didn't wash off

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
follow it through and I didn't wash off
a<00:00:49.469> step<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.160> which<00:00:50.520> you're<00:00:50.969> meant<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
a step one which you're meant to do and

a step one which you're meant to do and
that<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.649> ruined<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> whole<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that just ruined the whole thing and I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.760 
that just ruined the whole thing and I
felt<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.840> wasn't<00:00:54.989> using<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.559> correctly

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
felt like if I wasn't using it correctly

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.939 
felt like if I wasn't using it correctly
then<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.390> fair<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
until it's fully dry which might take a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.220 
until it's fully dry which might take a
bit<00:02:50.400> longer<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:51.510> depends<00:02:51.870> how<00:02:51.959> thick

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.260 

and<00:05:35.860> it's<00:05:35.980> very<00:05:36.070> important<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.640> once<00:05:37.090> you've

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
and it's very important that once you've

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.300 
and it's very important that once you've
cleared<00:05:37.540> your<00:05:37.660> pause<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.200> you<00:05:38.350> help<00:05:38.680> we<00:05:39.010> find

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.970 
cleared your pause that you help we find
them<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.420> that<00:05:40.600> it<00:05:40.870> helps<00:05:41.230> to<00:05:41.260> shrink<00:05:41.680> the

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
them and so that it helps to shrink the

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.730 
them and so that it helps to shrink the
pore<00:05:42.220> size<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:42.520> that<00:05:43.060> oil<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.990> debt<00:05:44.260> doesn't

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
pore size and that oil and debt doesn't

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.830 
pore size and that oil and debt doesn't
build<00:05:44.920> up<00:05:45.160> again<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:48.270> this<00:05:49.270> is<00:05:49.450> good

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
build up again so this is this is good

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.830 
build up again so this is this is good
so<00:05:50.590> thankfully<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.220> did<00:05:51.670> it<00:05:51.790> again<00:05:52.180> because<00:05:52.690> I

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
put a link down below in the information

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.480 
put a link down below in the information
box<00:06:43.510> as<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:44.350> why<00:06:44.500> I<00:06:44.530> bought<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:44.830> I<00:06:45.160> got<00:06:45.340> it<00:06:45.400> on

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
box as to why I bought it I got it on

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.020 
box as to why I bought it I got it on
eBay<00:06:45.700> like<00:06:46.210> I<00:06:46.360> said<00:06:46.660> it<00:06:47.560> was<00:06:47.710> about<00:06:48.430> eight<00:06:48.850> or

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
eBay like I said it was about eight or

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.330 
eBay like I said it was about eight or
nine<00:06:49.060> pounds<00:06:49.690> so<00:06:49.750> it<00:06:49.930> wasn't<00:06:50.200> too<00:06:50.290> expensive

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
nine pounds so it wasn't too expensive

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.150 
nine pounds so it wasn't too expensive
and<00:06:51.340> I'm<00:06:51.550> guessing<00:06:52.150> that<00:06:52.420> one<00:06:53.110> of<00:06:53.380> these<00:06:53.650> tubes

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
and I'm guessing that one of these tubes

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.520 
and I'm guessing that one of these tubes
which<00:06:54.400> is<00:06:54.550> step<00:06:54.760> number<00:06:54.910> two<00:06:55.360> that<00:06:55.660> actual

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530 
which is step number two that actual

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.690 
which is step number two that actual
charcoal<00:06:57.100> mask

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
charcoal mask

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.520 
charcoal mask
I'm<00:06:57.820> guessing<00:06:58.420> this<00:06:58.540> could<00:06:58.780> probably<00:06:58.990> last

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
I'm guessing this could probably last

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.610 
I'm guessing this could probably last
about<00:06:59.740> maybe<00:07:00.580> 10<00:07:00.820> to<00:07:00.970> 15<00:07:01.330> times<00:07:01.570> depending<00:07:02.440> on

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
about maybe 10 to 15 times depending on

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.920 
about maybe 10 to 15 times depending on
how<00:07:02.800> thick<00:07:03.100> you<00:07:03.400> apply<00:07:03.640> it<00:07:03.700> so<00:07:04.360> I<00:07:04.390> think<00:07:04.510> it's<00:07:04.810> a

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
how thick you apply it so I think it's a

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.200 
how thick you apply it so I think it's a
really<00:07:05.290> good<00:07:05.470> investment<00:07:05.830> and<00:07:06.340> I<00:07:06.880> probably

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
really good investment and I probably

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.330 
really good investment and I probably
only<00:07:07.690> need<00:07:07.990> to<00:07:08.080> do<00:07:08.200> this<00:07:08.320> once<00:07:08.620> a<00:07:08.770> week<00:07:08.800> because
