difficult with one hand when it's not
installed<00:02:37.300> into<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.600> case<00:02:38.280> because<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.760> keep

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
installed into the case because I keep

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.729 
installed into the case because I keep
pushing<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.780> backwards<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.410> can<00:02:44.560> have

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
pushing it backwards so you can have

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.750 
pushing it backwards so you can have
degrees<00:02:45.430> Celsius<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.209> Fahrenheit

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.699 

you<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.390> swap<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.780> by<00:02:52.790> touching<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you just swap that by touching it

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.390 
you just swap that by touching it
now<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.220> arrow<00:02:56.579> here<00:02:56.970> takes<00:02:57.329> us<00:02:57.480> back<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
now this arrow here takes us back to the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.360 
now this arrow here takes us back to the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
can actually change the brightness of

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.619 
can actually change the brightness of

again<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.500> only<00:03:16.620> comes<00:03:16.950> up<00:03:17.129> for<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> little

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
again it only comes up for a little

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.099 
again it only comes up for a little
while<00:03:19.040> about<00:03:20.040> 10<00:03:20.430> seconds<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.689> there<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.930> go

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
while about 10 seconds so there you go

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.250 
while about 10 seconds so there you go
that's<00:03:22.349> medium<00:03:23.220> brightness

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
that's medium brightness

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.240 
that's medium brightness
that's<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.590> lowest<00:03:26.099> brightness<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:28.250> then

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that's the lowest brightness and then

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.530 
that's the lowest brightness and then
that's<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.639> brightest<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:31.769> notice<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.209> camera

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
that's the brightest I notice the camera

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.910 
that's the brightest I notice the camera
is<00:03:33.599> not<00:03:33.720> picking<00:03:33.959> up<00:03:34.079> much<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.530> difference

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
is not picking up much of a difference

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.129 
is not picking up much of a difference
but<00:03:35.129> by<00:03:35.430> eye<00:03:35.459> there<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.150> quite<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.720> lot<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.049> a

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
but by eye there is quite a lot of a

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.020 
but by eye there is quite a lot of a
difference<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.769> from<00:03:38.489> here<00:03:38.609> we<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.849> select

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
difference so from here we can select

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.569 
difference so from here we can select
any<00:03:39.420> fan<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.049> I'm<00:03:40.139> going<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.409> select<00:03:40.560> fan<00:03:41.340> one

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
any fan so I'm going to select fan one

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.690 
any fan so I'm going to select fan one
because<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.239> channel<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.290> have

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
because that's the channel that I have

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.129 
because that's the channel that I have
the<00:03:44.700> fan<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.150> temp<00:03:45.359> sensor<00:03:45.659> probe<00:03:45.870> plugged

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
the fan and temp sensor probe plugged

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.530 
the fan and temp sensor probe plugged
into<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.829> can<00:03:46.920> see<00:03:47.190> my<00:03:47.250> ambient<00:03:48.150> temp<00:03:48.480> is

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
into so you can see my ambient temp is

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.420 
into so you can see my ambient temp is
32<00:03:51.540> degrees<00:03:51.900> because<00:03:52.859> I've<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.069> got<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
32 degrees because I've just got the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.159 
32 degrees because I've just got the
temp<00:03:53.849> sensor<00:03:54.150> probes<00:03:54.420> sitting<00:03:54.750> here<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.049> the

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
temp sensor probes sitting here on the

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:01.339 
temp sensor probes sitting here on the
desk<00:03:58.220> now<00:03:59.220> there's<00:03:59.639> a<00:03:59.699> rpm<00:04:00.329> reading<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
desk now there's a rpm reading in the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.490 
desk now there's a rpm reading in the
top<00:04:01.530> left<00:04:01.769> hand<00:04:01.949> corner<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:03.500> awesomely

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
top left hand corner and awesomely

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.020 
top left hand corner and awesomely
enough<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.129> actually<00:04:05.280> be<00:04:05.430> swapped<00:04:05.849> from

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
enough that can actually be swapped from

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.020 
enough that can actually be swapped from
rpm<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:07.260> voltage<00:04:08.299> just<00:04:09.299> by<00:04:09.480> touching<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:11.030> at

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
rpm to voltage just by touching it so at

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.939 
rpm to voltage just by touching it so at
the<00:04:12.150> moment<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.199> fan<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.620> using

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
the moment you can see the fan is using

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.349 
the moment you can see the fan is using
six<00:04:14.639> or<00:04:14.819> seven<00:04:15.120> volts<00:04:16.459> now<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.729> on<00:04:17.880> manual<00:04:18.269> at

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
six or seven volts now is on manual at

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.839 
six or seven volts now is on manual at
the<00:04:18.479> moment<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.139> see<00:04:19.380> here<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.949> can<00:04:20.489> change

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
the moment we can see here I can change

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.300 
the moment we can see here I can change
that<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.239> automatic<00:04:21.800> so<00:04:22.800> I'll<00:04:22.889> just<00:04:23.010> leave<00:04:23.250> it

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
that to automatic so I'll just leave it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.800 
that to automatic so I'll just leave it
on<00:04:23.490> manual<00:04:23.699> for<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.030> moment<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.539> show<00:04:24.750> you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
on manual for the moment and show you

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.990 
on manual for the moment and show you
how<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.380> adjust<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:26.099> just<00:04:26.250> drag<00:04:26.490> your<00:04:26.699> finger

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
how to adjust you just drag your finger

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.730 
how to adjust you just drag your finger
across<00:04:28.099> so<00:04:29.099> now<00:04:29.280> it's<00:04:29.460> at<00:04:29.580> 77%<00:04:30.240> 9<00:04:30.720> volts

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.260 

100%<00:04:36.879> full<00:04:37.879> 12<00:04:38.240> volts

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.839 

and<00:04:43.199> I'll<00:04:43.319> just<00:04:43.470> show<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.680> what<00:04:43.979> rpm<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.729> at

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
and I'll just show you what rpm it is at

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.080 
and I'll just show you what rpm it is at
100%<00:04:45.539> as<00:04:45.630> well<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.069> about<00:04:47.280> it's<00:04:47.880> meant<00:04:48.060> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
100% as well so it's about it's meant to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.909 
100% as well so it's about it's meant to
be<00:04:48.150> 1,400<00:04:48.930> rpm<00:04:49.259> which<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.680> very<00:04:50.069> close<00:04:51.919> now

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
be 1,400 rpm which it's very close now

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.640 
be 1,400 rpm which it's very close now
manual<00:04:53.340> control<00:04:53.789> is<00:04:54.090> based<00:04:54.419> on<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
manual control is based on the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.360 
manual control is based on the
temperature<00:04:56.630> I'm<00:04:57.630> sorry<00:04:58.020> automatic<00:04:58.530> control

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
temperature I'm sorry automatic control

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.670 
temperature I'm sorry automatic control
is<00:04:59.610> based<00:04:59.819> on<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.120> temperature<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.560> will

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
is based on the temperature so it will

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.350 
is based on the temperature so it will
adjust<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.130> fan<00:05:02.400> depending<00:05:03.120> on<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
adjust the fan depending on the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.110 
adjust the fan depending on the
temperature<00:05:03.889> that's<00:05:04.889> receiving<00:05:05.789> through

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
temperature that's receiving through

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.529 
temperature that's receiving through
that<00:05:06.349> through<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.590> temperature<00:05:08.460> probe<00:05:08.729> that

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
that through the temperature probe that

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.120 
that through the temperature probe that
is<00:05:09.660> plugged<00:05:09.930> into<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.349> particular<00:05:10.650> channel

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
is plugged into this particular channel

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.279 
is plugged into this particular channel
so<00:05:11.280> this<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.460> channel<00:05:12.590> 132<00:05:13.590> degrees<00:05:14.120> it's

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
so this is channel 132 degrees it's

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.510 
so this is channel 132 degrees it's
putting<00:05:16.289> out<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.530> fan<00:05:16.830> rpm<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.310> 50<00:05:17.880> percent<00:05:19.520> so

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
putting out a fan rpm of 50 percent so

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.999 
putting out a fan rpm of 50 percent so
the<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:21.599> maximum<00:05:21.960> temperature<00:05:22.289> is<00:05:22.620> 70

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
the the maximum temperature is 70

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.510 
the the maximum temperature is 70
degrees<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.780> obviously<00:05:25.620> as<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.069> gets<00:05:26.250> closer

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
degrees so obviously as it gets closer

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.059 
degrees so obviously as it gets closer
to<00:05:26.639> 70<00:05:27.060> degrees<00:05:27.419> the<00:05:27.720> fan<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.080> going<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.319> be

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
to 70 degrees the fan is going to be

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.110 
to 70 degrees the fan is going to be
reaching<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.520> hundred<00:05:29.819> percent<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:32.520> will<00:05:32.729> sound

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
reaching a hundred percent it will sound

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.779 
reaching a hundred percent it will sound
an<00:05:33.360> alarm<00:05:33.630> if<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.110> goes<00:05:34.289> above<00:05:34.500> 70<00:05:35.130> degrees<00:05:35.159> and

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
an alarm if it goes above 70 degrees and

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.290 
an alarm if it goes above 70 degrees and
it<00:05:36.569> will<00:05:36.720> also<00:05:36.930> sound<00:05:37.470> an<00:05:37.680> alarm<00:05:37.919> if<00:05:38.819> the<00:05:39.030> fan

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
it will also sound an alarm if the fan

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.420 
it will also sound an alarm if the fan
drops

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.439 

hang<00:05:44.430> on<00:05:44.520> I'll<00:05:44.669> just<00:05:45.080> show<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:47.210> let's<00:05:48.210> see

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
hang on I'll just show you let's see

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.640 
hang on I'll just show you let's see
where<00:05:48.599> that<00:05:48.630> alarm<00:05:49.050> starts

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:01.060 

so<00:05:55.170> 11%<00:05:58.410> okay

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
so 11% okay

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.700 
so 11% okay
actually<00:06:02.070> if<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.280> manually<00:06:02.700> change<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.710> the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
actually if you manually change the the

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.070 
actually if you manually change the the
fan<00:06:04.950> rpm<00:06:05.400> right<00:06:05.670> down<00:06:05.970> it<00:06:06.300> doesn't<00:06:06.660> sound<00:06:06.840> an

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
fan rpm right down it doesn't sound an

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.500 
fan rpm right down it doesn't sound an
alarm<00:06:07.400> because<00:06:08.400> you<00:06:09.210> know<00:06:09.300> you're

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
alarm because you know you're

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.590 
alarm because you know you're
deliberately<00:06:09.990> changing<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:11.270> and<00:06:12.270> that's<00:06:12.480> how

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
deliberately changing it and that's how

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.200 
deliberately changing it and that's how
I've<00:06:12.870> managed<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.350> get<00:06:14.100> silence<00:06:14.670> on<00:06:14.880> all<00:06:15.030> the

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
I've managed to get silence on all the

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.380 
I've managed to get silence on all the
other<00:06:15.360> channels<00:06:16.520> by<00:06:17.520> just<00:06:17.880> turning<00:06:18.240> them<00:06:18.330> down

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
other channels by just turning them down

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.630 
other channels by just turning them down
to<00:06:18.690> zero<00:06:18.930> on<00:06:19.260> manual<00:06:19.710> now<00:06:20.250> you<00:06:20.310> can<00:06:20.520> actually

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
to zero on manual now you can actually

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.370 
to zero on manual now you can actually
have<00:06:20.880> one<00:06:21.150> channel<00:06:21.510> on<00:06:21.600> many<00:06:21.840> on<00:06:21.990> one<00:06:22.110> channel

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
have one channel on many on one channel

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.810 
have one channel on many on one channel
on<00:06:22.560> auto<00:06:22.830> you<00:06:23.490> know<00:06:23.610> you<00:06:23.670> can<00:06:25.460> have<00:06:26.460> each

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
on auto you know you can have each

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.880 
on auto you know you can have each
channel<00:06:27.390> set<00:06:27.690> differently<00:06:28.110> you<00:06:28.470> use<00:06:28.650> these

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
channel set differently you use these

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.250 
channel set differently you use these
run<00:06:29.160> left<00:06:29.430> and<00:06:29.670> arrows<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.720> access<00:06:31.110> the

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
run left and arrows to access the

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.470 
run left and arrows to access the
different<00:06:31.410> channels<00:06:31.970> okay<00:06:32.970> so<00:06:33.180> there's<00:06:33.420> no

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
different channels okay so there's no

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.050 
different channels okay so there's no
fan<00:06:33.870> plugged<00:06:34.170> into<00:06:34.380> this<00:06:34.590> now<00:06:35.310> if<00:06:35.460> I<00:06:35.610> want<00:06:35.910> this

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
fan plugged into this now if I want this

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.489 
fan plugged into this now if I want this
up

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:41.499 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:46.579 

the<00:06:42.039> alarm<00:06:42.399> is<00:06:42.699> supposed<00:06:43.269> to<00:06:43.419> start<00:06:43.860> sounding

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:46.589 
the alarm is supposed to start sounding

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:52.139 
the alarm is supposed to start sounding
here<00:06:47.589> we<00:06:47.709> go<00:06:48.509> okay<00:06:50.519> so<00:06:51.519> that's<00:06:51.699> when<00:06:51.909> you<00:06:51.999> get

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:52.149 
here we go okay so that's when you get

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:57.329 
here we go okay so that's when you get
an<00:06:52.300> alarm<00:06:52.539> when<00:06:52.929> it's<00:06:55.589> you<00:06:56.589> know<00:06:56.709> outputting

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:57.339 
an alarm when it's you know outputting

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.339 
an alarm when it's you know outputting
voltage<00:06:57.789> but<00:06:58.149> the<00:06:58.239> fan<00:06:58.449> is<00:06:58.689> not<00:06:59.019> doing

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
voltage but the fan is not doing

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:07.799 
voltage but the fan is not doing
anything<00:07:05.279> all<00:07:06.279> right<00:07:06.489> so<00:07:06.849> that's<00:07:06.999> basically

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:07.809 
anything all right so that's basically

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:13.679 
anything all right so that's basically
all<00:07:08.229> the<00:07:08.649> functionality<00:07:12.569> thanks<00:07:13.569> for

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:13.689 
all the functionality thanks for

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:16.169 
all the functionality thanks for
watching<00:07:13.989> guys
