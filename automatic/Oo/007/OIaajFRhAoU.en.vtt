00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.870
 we are a few days ago that will be 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.660
 present the group because he appreciates that the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.119
 photo shoot and obviously vanessa 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.740
 and to us how is this topic which 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.390
 are the orders with that in the points of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.390
 the couple about music 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.380
 because they also say out there 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.579
 right now I tell you that they emerge in towns 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 They are a couple that are very good at 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.210
 purple very happy are very determined 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 margins know has really stressed me 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.289
 vanessa I want this seems I do not want 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.370
 this he has a song that identifies 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.230
 the love of her that one of coldplay 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.610
 in entering with that but in the end 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.350
 they decided only with the bridal march 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.960
 because they are focused more on what 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.909
 traditional and then look for is blue piece 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.299
 they want music their people varied 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.730
 danceable music running with a day 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.000
 merengue do not want salsa 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.140
 we saw corpses 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.210
 they do not know how to dance and their friends a little 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.210
 but those have no truth 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:31.000
 and we also passed our repertoire of 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.710
 poker they will be returned this 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.380
 leaving some songs giving 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.840
 priority to this after also you 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.750
 I tell that the bass Pablo wants to do 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.090
 that's about the hype then that we're going to 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.540
 do it we're going to hit a hype very 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.540
 radical 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.950
 and also wants the limbo according to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.950
 which all attacks 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.900
 they made a version of the song of 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.830
 it but said techno medium investment 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.830
 so 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.290
 Famous 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.290
 wow
