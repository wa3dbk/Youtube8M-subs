00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.110
柴 正 is a Dragon Dora minutes series bansu 3 let producers together 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.660
 You are welcome 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:23.029
 To fight together with the loan riding on the flight mother of Dragon to say that there is a back hair 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:29.750
 But first I have 9 charts, but after that I try to do that anxiety 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:31.300
 It is the story of how that uniqueness of the world view of that are stuck to its customers 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.770
 Sokko 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 I wonder what it's all about fantasy so tired I didn't start being sweet 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:45.350
 But I but that if it is this fun strong words is that very color or rather monumental work 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:52.519
 I understand, but the smell is 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:57.829
 There is a very strong view of the world and narrative, so let's make it even more intense eight years ago 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:01.670
 I think that I have been experiencing a new experience with various budgets in the different 8 years 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.680
 Where is it supposed to stand like a form without experience ? 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.680
 That's poverty there this time to think 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.420
 The main character is deciding where it was this time 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.680
 Another Utautai mode and Well return value is 3 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.630
 There is something that will be the basis of Berserk, but what is it and why did you do that ? 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.940
 Well, unfortunately it is to say 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.070
 The action Te project one-two 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 Those Well it is said that the unrefined action in terms of the Japanese 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.330
 It didn't come as much as it could be, but it is very high as a bargain now 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.460
 Where you want to make your favorite , but for high-speed action 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.830
 I want to specialize suddenly 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.830
 I think that it is very characteristic that there is no one in the gym battle Hen world first organization 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.690
 this story office excess tooth 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.300
 Wood climbing rope chiffon or fison 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.300
 Cherry blossoms to say in the other + trader world view 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.580
 Matter the Hiahhanashi 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:22.350
 I think it is one of the key features of the game 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.760
 This Well say whether doing there Well what intention I'd such for the novel 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.920
 Wintering I'd have just let me answer somehow in an interview 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.239
 If you are playing a game , come to the urban tissue that is the enemy 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.189
 Rather than still in such a long period of time even if a friend or asked to've defeated as soon as it was well manner 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.239
 That character 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.299
 To town missing or standing character also be the favorite to not even know the people who 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.880
 Because I can not 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:51.170
 If so, the background behind the story of the people 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.150
 Browser Well If you leave the participation that anyone sees for free in the web, it will be 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.560
 After all I read that 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.740
 I mean np to the corresponding and the same, for example, law at all, even 10 minutes is different 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.210
 Is known to say Datte got to say to say this of you Teko Tsu character So this 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.890
 Ne 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:10.290
 The effect of the place called game-mer or partial view of the world that depth comes out also is including deep out as 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.100
 Even if this time to advance such Fu to be used to want to aim 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.270
 I am 38 but I have been making this anxiety for 4 years 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.130
 It is an event 14 years ago that goes back from a tree and with a center injury 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.730
 Hmm 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:29.020
 It is 14 years old by 10 years for the first time from there, so even if you focus at university, it is 23 and it enters alive 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.350
 Was a producer in the first or second year 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.630
 Where you want to see Hisayoshi's work 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:40.720
 Met at the unpleasant memories if or a variety of unpleasant memories and start again from there retrospect 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.830
 I think I have a bad memory 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 Well that 's right, I guess it 's actually a producer process. 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.560
 In short 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.640
 The are available Kedomo there is in you the way projector will jump over there 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.350
 Not only in the producer but I think that will victorious in 1 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.810
 In short, I have been working on that dragging spring for a long time = my producer's scepter 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.150
 Because after that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.760
 Various sonson 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.900
 It is a tree where there are various thoughts , and this team is doing for the first time in eight years 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.049
 look 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.830
 Well, if I thought that I would be able to spray it because I had the strength 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.310
 Well there is a lot of something more than that 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:22.900
 It is a work that brought me up suddenly 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:27.550
 Always is this to have is a series of = I only'm now car Kedomo's 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.980
 There is a place like that of the second , change and look back 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.030
 It is a place that is the same 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.320
 I will talk only in the four sides in the future, but it is true that it is the first time in eight years that it will revive 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.580
 Why do you think this timing once and for all will be heard by everyone and answer properly 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.770
 It is useless 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:47.650
 Hmmm 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:53.949
 Kedomo did you say that you Moso is sorrow in the market 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:05:01.790
 I'm shrinking, I guess I'm getting more and more smart smartphones are transitioning 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:05:06.169
 But it is the company that has sent aki course fees 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:12.409
 I think that I want to offer something to the customer's respect there 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:17.419
 After all it seems that I got the question for me from that Azuki Zaku, but it is very expensive for the game 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:20.110
 There properly calories towards the kind of value in some of the many people not even over money 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.350
 Because there is a user , against the person properly 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 I mean, I want to make a game that specializes in the people 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.240
 I wonder if the title Draken is appropriate for the title 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.110
 I read it 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.110
 I think that has become the commodity was everyone orientation also bet because very
