00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.700
Hello everyone! I‘m Sr. Vassa, and, as usual,
I‘m delighted you've joined me for this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.700
brief Coffee Break. Today, zillions, let‘s
reflect a little bit about self-limitation.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.179
Because now, we have all reached – in all
calendars - the preparation-period before

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:31.179
the great feast of Christmas, called Advent
in the Latin tradition, and the Nativity

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.430
or Christmas Fast in the Byzantine church
calendar. We naturally... Can you guys stop

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.420
walking in front of the camera when I‘m
filming?! My crew does not take my Coffee

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.100
Breaks seriously – just because they don‘t
write these episodes. As I was saying, we

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.209
associate fasting, zillions, naturally with
self-limitation, and some of us might be 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:05.780
procrastinating about
beginning our fast and re-focusing on the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.780
up-coming feast. Because we do tend to procrastinate
about something we perceive from its negative

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.600
side; something we perceive, perhaps, as a big
“no,“ rather than a big “yes.“ So

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.299
I would like to suggest to you that fasting
is actually a big “yes“ rather than a

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.299
“no.“ It is an act of will, with a very
clear vision or goal in mind: the vision of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.560
the upcoming feast, in this case the birth
of our Savior in Bethlehem. In this decisive

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:48.549
act of taking on a conscious preparation for
this event, in body and in soul, we are saying

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.030
“yes“ to embracing the feast, together
with the community of our tradition. The reason

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.030
this involves self-limitation is, really,
that any act of will is tied to self-limitation,

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.500
as very helpfully G. K. Chesterton points
out in this wonderful little book that I happened

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.040
to be looking at recently. It‘s called “Orthodoxy“
– you probably already know this book. Anyway,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.290
here Chesterton writes that: “Every act
of will is an act of self-

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.790
limitation. To desire action is to desire
limitation. In that sense every act is an

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.790
act of self-sacrifice. When you choose anything,
you reject everything else.“ So, that might

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.040
be obvious, but, as we limit ourselves in
certain ways these weeks before Christmas,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.040
let‘s remember this obvious fact: that we
do so because we want to. But that‘s it for

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.078
today, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope to
see you next time.
