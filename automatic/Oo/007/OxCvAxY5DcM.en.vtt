00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.100
 This button on the back is pretty good 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.290
 The screen is pretty clean but this is the power of tft LCD 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.160
 Is not it 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.080
 Iphone Nde strong manufacturer in quite ne liquid crystal in the Well that lc 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.560
 This is the user 's booker 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.599
 Beautiful as the dynamic of Well another awesome 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.850
 Sleep side by side iphone When you line up iphone is really big and the size of the screen is remarkable 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.850
 I am 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.530
 It is when you try it also weighs comparison 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.520
 Although it is the same weight as the town, a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.410
 It is so big that the cat's screen is so big but it weighs so much 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:51.940
 Even if I used it does not come I thought Naa easy to use in the better of the big screen 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:57.399
 It 's easy to input dumplings , and when you watch a video on youtube something 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.520
 Speaking see if I have a very powerful'm Well one unfortunate thing on the big screen 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.930
 Well then the capacity is 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.750
 Well there are 32 gb but it is actually 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:12.850
 If you can save it already, there are only twenty more gb 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:17.360
 Sd Although the card is I'm such a place called what can be put roots with suddenly 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.870
 There is no place to insert an sd card 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:26.210
 Here is the good that was earlier introduced but 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.680
 I need to save it with a micro sb card reader 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.520
 The case is here 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 a insert the micro sd is inserted into the card reader 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.240
 So it is the way to save to micro sd though 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.790
 Well how do you take this ? 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:49.360
 I think it might be a little going to take a walk with this for a while 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.159
 It's a pity, I think it might be a pity from iphone users 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.870
 Then there is no such external slot anymore 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:02.950
 Well, I think it would be a pity for my phone users to have such things alone 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.409
 Though it may be said to the android in general though 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.979
 This I because you see on the TV 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.390
 I can watch TV and I have infrared rays . 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:18.129
 It is how this smartphone is what infrared light is attached to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.129
 Of course you can turn off the power of the air conditioner . 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:25.430
 You can also have a sound power of TV 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:29.050
 Say it is a You're have farewell phenethyl 2 only functions 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.900

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:38.519
 Power supply 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:42.750
 It is time to change the camera here and I hope to introduce the features of only the facts 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.930
 First of all , I would like to introduce the slide window function 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.930
 Hmmm 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.150
 The slide window is like calling up to 3 apps instantly 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.990
 It is a function that can be done and what it means to say 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.310
 First of all, you will get a call app 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:06.380
 You open this screen with three fingers Conu 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.820
 Slide from right to left and left to Fu say and to do so uplinks have been saved 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.110
 Well beyond 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:17.010
 Launch chrome and this page with three fingers 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.340
 Suppression to you I still so out of Tteyuu application has been disturbing 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.170
 And there is one more calendar 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.620
 To slide from right to left to start the calendar 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.610
 Yes and saved three apps 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.300
 How do I call this three saved apps? 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.590
 Is it 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:40.160
 Also with three fingers this time it will slide from left to right 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.069
 The app you saved now comes out like this 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.310
 Well this is it 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.280
 like this if it is chrome 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:53.600
 Pick I will as soon as the screen we are now up touch 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.200
 Well, if you want to erase this individually, it will disappear if you post ride on it again 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.770
 Because 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.220
 I think I can use it 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.730
 You have to push it here to the home button long to say apps using Well until now 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.390
 More 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.590
 In this way I though I leave is 1 bullet It is that's it 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:14.150
 Even though I know so well ios that I have to read that 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.750
 ios is loading like this, I use it now and I can read an application called 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.549
 This is the sound but I can 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:27.159
 If you open the app it will be loaded again 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:29.409
 Is it possible to open the app in less than it is when the time a little while ago of I suede window 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:32.910
 It has become a function that can 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:37.350
 docomo Kurosshi Yaro It's cool 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.370
 Though surely did not do squat say there would be DoCoMo models on hand 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.370
 Yes let's continue 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:51.000
 I would like to introduce a feature called even Hugh 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.900
 q Slide is here . If you make the sound menu above here q q Slide 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.820

 If you do so, a list called apps corresponding to 9 suede called old suede app 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:06.870
 So let's go to the internet 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.280
 It looks like this: q Slide is like size, but you are free to choose 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.770
 I can do it 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.430
 Various this way 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.530
 to apple rice us 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.530
 You can put it in one screen 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.620
 Nde 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.129
 Do the Internet while checking the product value of maa 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.770
 a 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:31.430
 For example, I have already started 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.669
 It is able to launch multiple apps on one screen 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:40.139
 q I wonder if you can use the slide machine quite 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:42.700
 Yet you can choose to have the cat also transparency of cat 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.770
 You can also erase 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:06:05.790
 Good or will not it this pretty convenient 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:06:06.830
 The scene comes out but it's a pure nude 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.650
 Laplace 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.240
 Choose 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.150
 Yes it is that kind of mid-Te Mars yes that 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:20.480
 I understand 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:26.300
 When I say normal capture, I save only the part displayed on the screen 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.990
 It is here this time, but capture + is this whole page many times 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.100
 To capture 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.820
 Although it is the work to trim here 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.380
 Huh 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.639
 Well that part of the area that is not displayed can also be a passenger car 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.180
 It is big 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.630
 There is no need to slide and set 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.289
 I think this is a very useful function Capture + 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.800
 For me, it is c. This is naa 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:57.120

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.139
 It's a clipboard but I 'll collect and open it 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.270

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.680

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.260
 I'm firmly here 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.890
 Copy note the lower right corner of the Imamura Gataine 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.890

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:32.550

 Is I come out to say at the time is I Dongfeng paste and clipboard to paste 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.010

 You can choose the ice machine and comes out poop that issued the earlier 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:46.000
 But if you select the clipboard, the characters copied up to now appear like a cat 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.830
 Come 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.230
 Like this 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:54.590
 It can be a list, so I can paste it if you select me solo 

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.790
 this is 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:04.550
 9 ã‚‚ ã‚“ iphone If you use such an app 

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:05.360
 I think I heard it but it is quite easy to use to say that it is included from the beginning 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.750
 I think 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.940
 This feature is also recommended 

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:15.550
 Today we have introduced here the overall specs and features of lg g 2 

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.910
