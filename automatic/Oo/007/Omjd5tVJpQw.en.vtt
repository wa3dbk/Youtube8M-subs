00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.089
 I miss gororoba that one more time doing 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.190
 a commented gameplay 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 I started with that stick there. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 hive by the following 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 some people were sending me 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 saying that I have to have a staff 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.170
 because all youtube has cordon and thing 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.359
 and such but I have no interest in having 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.969
 a staff exactly only for you to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 talk I have a staff do not roll 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.280
 God speak something cool that the people 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.760
 like I can keep repeating but not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 is interest is something planned and already 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.719
 there are several in October says of course not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 most of them have some staff I can 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.129
 end up appearing and I want to copy a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 This is not going to be an advertisement. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.489
 positive for the channel because copying does not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.170
 It's cool, that's okay. 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 this gameplay in the background that I am 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.159
 bringing it on the jackson or the map 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.549
 little boat I'm playing with a pw 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.820
 57 very strong maybe overpowered 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.340
 because it is widely used will be 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.840
 that she will be 9007 guys will use 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.790
 Totally, I think so, but also 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.580
 there is nothing for the only active action 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.759
 The one I think is her comb. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.259
 50 shot bullet is a lot still 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.150
 but putting a smart comb is 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.579
 practically a light machine gun only 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 than with the mobility of an envelope 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.930
 machine is very 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.180
 I do not know, but for now I'm testing. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.549
 playing with several various weapons is not 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.170
 Just the one I'm playing but I got it. 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 some good game place with her and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.490
 I would also like to get into the subject 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.979
 It's like I said in my first video of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 channel that had just finished the thing 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.399
 field and the anti-game was 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.049
 decreased and I changed my concept no 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.070
 decreased by karina not all the same 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.290
 dung 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 I think I was younger because 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.179
 who buys code on the first day of 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.740
 release is caught at dawn is just the people 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.660
 who is a fan really is not this people who 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.680
 The one who plays just to shit upset the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.480
 fun of the other because after the one 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.290
 week judging began to look like 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.950
 play these Iberian scholarships even from your 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.070
 use 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.760
 But there are a lot of people that 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.700
 total anti-gambling because I put it together 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.720
 to that electric iron there for you to pass 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.120
 and stick together put the final 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.170
 very used where you will have these bags 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.240
 Iberian but not enough to be a 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.780
 something you could not control 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.150
 because if you play with a pec em dinei 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.760
 and engineer can you see through 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.430
 of the walls and this is only to fall on it if 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.140
 do you want to be an engineer? 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.570
 But the problem is that you're going to have to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.260
 spend a pec more plans to use 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.690
 that's okay 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.640
 he is not that whole population that 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.310
 people always complained he's a 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.830
 pack good for those who play the cool by 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.390
 example I had a match that I made the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
 Test I played without standing still 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.160
 At the moment I did not appear on the radar 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.720
 moment and also does not have as the jacket 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.990
 It is moving forward all the time 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.280
 even damn you 're sure to get 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.520
 get a champion way 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.340
 using this but until I see it 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:46.450
 good the pec is balanced much more 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:51.850
 weak than actions because it was very 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:55.120
 strong now is a package goes if it goes 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.400
 save you make you play better not 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.390
 another thing that had criticized a lot in the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.390
 first video was the use of vants 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.130
 I'm not against because after you 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.770
 take some do not know for a while playing 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.450
 I'll find out that hard reset myself. 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.690
 I think it's black hatch I do not remember 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.479
 exactly the name of the item here that is 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.240
 the tactic is that since the little things 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.400
 you look in 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.849
 in vant in four seconds they can 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 be quite destroyed. 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.759
 missiles that destroy the vant and for whom 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.830
 likes to destroy it 's good that it gives 75 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.539
 points each time and every time if you 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.940
 destroy them if you have 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.160
 using the online network is almost a fifth 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:54.259
 it helps you a lot to get your scores 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:58.380
 trix what else can i say 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:03.900
 this one running away from the topic of the 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:06.150
 of the game is that much new year 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.030
 difficult anyone likes to help anyone 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.180
 Do you want to see what you have? 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.710
 that you ask for more education like this 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.599
 Please, you can see in the video. 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.000
 You spread it like you wrote it. 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.650
 like, thank you, I'm not going to tie 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.360
 no one in the chain compelling my videos 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.949
 no of course not 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.680
 but even you talking with all education 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.289
 of the world has a face that neither catches nor speaks 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.289
 motherfucking little motherfucker sucks 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.729
 Give up that fucking clown you got. 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.530
 Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on. 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.289
 I do not know what's wrong with the head. 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.860
 these guys that they earn with this 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.630
 that's where they win but I think 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.949
 It must be a problem of wanting to prove 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.810
 that it's better that someone is not because 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.740
 someone who is well resolved who is well 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.570
 successful 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.669
 no need to put anyone down 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.409
 to feel better at all 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.610
 I have never seen a successful person doing a 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:58.250
 clown day 10 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:01.650
 and to conclude that today's gameplay 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.479
 I'm with serious thought about starting 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.509
 playing on psn buying a playstation 3 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.370
 see how they are users in 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.680
 other places is not because it only plays in the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.539
 live has no idea what it's like to play a 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.539
 psn or how to play on the computer 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.770
 I think it should make some difference 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.659
 It should be cool, play has more. 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.580
 Brazilians playing is because playstation 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:33.599
 3 Whether or not it is sold here in the 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:36.089
 Brazil of today 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.790
 If this is the case, please excuse the 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:40.300
 my 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.310
 lack of speech ability 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.800
