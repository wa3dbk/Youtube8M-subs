need some help on BAM 10 years ago we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.340 
need some help on BAM 10 years ago we
went<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.759> neurologist<00:00:32.940> who<00:00:33.719> started<00:00:34.199> her

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
went to the neurologist who started her

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.720 
went to the neurologist who started her
on<00:00:34.670> basic<00:00:35.670> tests<00:00:35.969> MRIs<00:00:36.480> muscle<00:00:36.989> biopsies

on basic tests MRIs muscle biopsies
chromosome<00:00:38.730> tests<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.260> tests<00:00:40.649> were

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
chromosome tests all these tests were

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.080 
chromosome tests all these tests were
coming<00:00:41.100> back<00:00:41.250> normal

the<00:00:42.270> doctors<00:00:42.690> would<00:00:42.960> exhaust<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.680> their

the doctors would exhaust all their

the doctors would exhaust all their
efforts<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.430> find<00:00:44.700> an<00:00:45.090> answer<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.840> her<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
efforts to find an answer for her and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
efforts to find an answer for her and
once<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:47.070> did<00:00:47.130> that<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.210> couldn't<00:00:48.570> help

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
once they did that it they couldn't help

once they did that it they couldn't help
her<00:00:48.870> anymore<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.559> put<00:00:49.980> their<00:00:50.130> hands

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
her anymore they would put their hands

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.740 
her anymore they would put their hands
up<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.790> be<00:00:51.030> done<00:00:51.380> Shelby<00:00:52.380> is<00:00:52.559> an<00:00:52.739> example<00:00:53.130> of

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
up and be done Shelby is an example of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
up and be done Shelby is an example of
many<00:00:54.750> other<00:00:54.960> children<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.950> see<00:00:56.219> where

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
many other children that we see where

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.840 
many other children that we see where
there<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.149> no<00:00:57.360> diagnosis<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
there is no diagnosis I think that is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.810 
there is no diagnosis I think that is
probably<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.450> key<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.129> suspect<00:01:02.610> some

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
probably the key is that we suspect some

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.999 
probably the key is that we suspect some
things<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.079> not<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.589> exact

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
things but we do not have an exact

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.789 
things but we do not have an exact
diagnosis<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.020> may<00:01:07.259> must<00:01:07.530> think

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
diagnosis and that's what may must think

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
diagnosis and that's what may must think
that<00:01:07.860> should<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.850> an<00:01:09.090> excellent<00:01:09.510> candidate

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that should be an excellent candidate

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.950 
that should be an excellent candidate
for<00:01:10.460> genomic<00:01:11.460> sequencing<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.390> met<00:01:12.600> dr.

find a way to treat her and luckily we

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.140 
find a way to treat her and luckily we

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
had this clue we sequence a genome it's

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.880 
had this clue we sequence a genome it's
3<00:01:48.329> billion<00:01:48.630> letters<00:01:48.930> long<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.680> come<00:01:49.860> down

3 billion letters long and we come down
