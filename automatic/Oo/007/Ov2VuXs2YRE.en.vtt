better<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.790> said<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.090> before<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
better I said that before but I have to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.539 
better I said that before but I have to
stress<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> young<00:01:41.040> talent<00:01:41.250> behind

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
stress that a lot of young talent behind

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.700

his<00:01:43.860> roster<00:01:46.280> now<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.850> didn't

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
his roster now the one thing I didn't

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
his roster now the one thing I didn't
like<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.659> Cardinals<00:01:49.229> draft<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
like about the Cardinals draft is that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.679 
like about the Cardinals draft is that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
board they could have taken him

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
board they could have taken him
somewhere<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.560> draft<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.219> they

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
now all Palmer has to do with all these

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
now all Palmer has to do with all these
weapons<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:09.000> Christian<00:02:09.360> Ponder<00:02:09.720> he

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
weapons is not be Christian Ponder he

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.050

doesn't have to be Kevin cop if he can

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
doesn't have to be Kevin cop if he can
just<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.330> average<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.200> think<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.500> could<00:02:13.650> have

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
just be average I think they could have

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.280 
just be average I think they could have
a<00:02:13.830> chance

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
a chance

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.520 
a chance
