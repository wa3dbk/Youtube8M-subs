00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
ever new icon Pro Series gauges now you

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.720 
ever new icon Pro Series gauges now you
remember<00:00:15.929> last<00:00:16.109> year<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.710> had<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.130> command

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
remember last year I had the I command

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.730 
remember last year I had the I command
gauges<00:00:18.180> installed<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.930> year<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> went<00:00:19.560> with

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
gauges installed this year I went with

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.310 
gauges installed this year I went with
the<00:00:19.859> Pro<00:00:20.070> Series<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.510> they

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
the Pro Series and as you can see they

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920 
the Pro Series and as you can see they
look<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.820> mean<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.090> fit<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.779> there

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
look just like I mean they fit in there

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
look just like I mean they fit in there
that<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.320> far<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> look<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.160> perfect<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that as far as the look it's perfect and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.509 
that as far as the look it's perfect and
they<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.330> analog<00:00:27.810> needles<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
they have analog needles just like a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.790 
they have analog needles just like a
regular<00:00:29.699> gauge<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> difference<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.529> as

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
regular gauge but the difference is as

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.569 
regular gauge but the difference is as
these<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:33.059> reading<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.800> icon

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these are reading just like on my icon

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.750 
these are reading just like on my icon
gauges<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.870> start<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.380> up

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
gauges if you see we just start them up

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.520 
gauges if you see we just start them up
they<00:00:38.760> come<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.270> self-test<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:40.379> go

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
they come up to self-test they go

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
they come up to self-test they go
through<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> test<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
through the test you can see that the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
through the test you can see that the
needles<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.020> back<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> forth<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> cool

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
needles go back and forth but the cool

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
needles go back and forth but the cool
thing<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.289> this<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> reading<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
thing is is this one here is reading the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.450 
thing is is this one here is reading the
tach<00:00:47.489> I've<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.809> trim<00:00:49.079> gauge<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> fuel

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
tach I've got my trim gauge I got a fuel

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.389 
tach I've got my trim gauge I got a fuel
gauge<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.780> Jeep<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.620> speedometer

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
gauge and I got my Jeep my speedometer

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.119 
gauge and I got my Jeep my speedometer
but<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.149> manometer<00:00:54.539> works<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.320> GPS<00:00:55.800> not

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
but this manometer works off at GPS not

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.880 
but this manometer works off at GPS not
off<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.489> water<00:00:56.670> pressure<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.379> all<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
off of water pressure so all this is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.430 
off of water pressure so all this is
tied<00:00:59.100> together<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.329> also<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.109> these

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
tied together I can also see all these

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
tied together I can also see all these
same<00:01:01.770> gauges<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.149> Lawrence<00:01:03.539> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
down the lake and I want to check out

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
down the lake and I want to check out
different<00:01:21.509> things<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.290> here

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
different things like this one here

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
different things like this one here
instead<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.189> being<00:01:23.369> rpms<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.689> look<00:01:24.900> at

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
instead of just being rpms I can look at

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.859 
instead of just being rpms I can look at

all this stuff is right at your

fingertips now and yet they look really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.749 
fingertips now and yet they look really
cool<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.579> regular

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
cool they look like just a regular

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.929 
cool they look like just a regular
analog<00:01:45.360> gauge<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.100> being<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.490> GPS

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.370 
analog gauge and with this being a GPS
speedometer<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> coolest

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
speedometer I think that's the coolest

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
speedometer I think that's the coolest
thing<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.939> thing<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
thing because there's one thing when it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.840 
thing because there's one thing when it
comes<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> boats<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.320> speedometers<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.460> are

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
comes to boats and speedometers they are

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.749 
comes to boats and speedometers they are
there<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:55.110> they've<00:01:56.070> been<00:01:56.280> they're
