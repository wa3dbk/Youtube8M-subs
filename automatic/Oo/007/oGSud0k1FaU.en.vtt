00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
 it's still a shame if you have to live 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.620
 dominated 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.820
 gold very good when we say at the beginning of the match we know their system too this 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.859
 it takes to know them by heart 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.949
 in sports at school the first things to progress during his 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:13.440
 investigation 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.289
 first surprise from the security in Corsica 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.730
 alain koffi gives the tone of entry what to annoy the coach of roanne 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.630
 It must be said that his team seems apathetic 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.679
 clumsy during that first half 19 balls lost in total and 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:27.440
 that in front 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.640
 the msb decided to be tackled reef on the ball carrier 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.510
 and enter the racket to score against his former teammates 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.859
 spencer and on a cloud with 17 points on his 24 and then scored before the break 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.120
 the appameans 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.790
 she added yes I think we played a very good defense tonight in 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.360
 team 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.980
 I'm glad to have participated in this defense provides especially what 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.160
 allows you to have won the need for action 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.140
 but the second is done at the level of these 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.789
 we say or write to qualify higher 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.090
 I tell myself that if you control their counter-attacked 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.910
 our classified games 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.360
 you have to put a lot of pressure because a lot of the intentions but 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 without violence and role play 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.440
 the goal was to do better than theirs offers the most more than 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.090
 promising and a lot 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.120
 solutions that often come up for a team 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.960
 on the team that finishes his button 30 phil neville puel so every position 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.570
 surprise kept everything that's perfect for me 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.320
 at the return of the locker room prone finds a little in a unit of the address 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.730
 marc-antoine pellin aligns three shots awarded in this mine as for me no 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.120
 among all 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.570
 for whom to return some against the teeth I try to give everything 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.160
 the draw against the team as the mans one of the four months by armed men 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.830
 it pays cash 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.320
 as for the month of march for me 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 a weak team bleeding to mention the tunes 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060
 and that's how quarter-time 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.030
 the pmsd and therefore proposes again the gap + 18 at the beginning of the last 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.770
 quarter-time currently underlying problem 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.039
 80 60 final score two days from the end of the regular season mans 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.419
 found the 4th place of the prey 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.409
 next appointment against another competitor live it will be Friday night
