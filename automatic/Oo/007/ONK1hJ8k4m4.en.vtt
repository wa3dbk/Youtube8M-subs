00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
this is a brilliant looking bike and it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.970 
this is a brilliant looking bike and it
doesn't<00:00:49.629> look<00:00:49.750> like<00:00:49.809> anything<00:00:50.559> else<00:00:50.769> out

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
doesn't look like anything else out

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.560 
doesn't look like anything else out
there<00:00:51.190> which<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.399> one<00:00:51.789> of<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.000> reasons<00:00:52.359> why<00:00:52.539> I

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
there which is one of the reasons why I

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.680 
there which is one of the reasons why I
really<00:00:52.809> really<00:00:53.620> really<00:00:54.010> love<00:00:54.339> this<00:00:54.519> bike<00:00:54.850> they

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
really really really love this bike they

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.299 
really really really love this bike they
have<00:00:55.780> taken<00:00:55.960> engineering<00:00:56.679> to<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:56.859> whole<00:00:57.160> new

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
have taken engineering to a whole new

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.130 
have taken engineering to a whole new
level<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.789> combined<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.480> with<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.660> very

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
level and combined it with a very

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.590 
level and combined it with a very
industrial<00:01:00.120> some<00:01:01.120> would<00:01:01.269> say<00:01:01.420> even

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
industrial some would say even

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.829 
industrial some would say even
antiquated<00:01:02.320> engine<00:01:03.190> design<00:01:03.550> but<00:01:04.360> it's<00:01:04.600> a

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
antiquated engine design but it's a

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.080 
antiquated engine design but it's a
beautiful<00:01:05.590> blend<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.159> two<00:01:06.190> worlds<00:01:06.850> it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
beautiful blend of the two worlds it's

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.450 
beautiful blend of the two worlds it's
really<00:01:07.660> remarkable<00:01:07.960> now<00:01:08.950> throwing<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.310> leg

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
really remarkable now throwing a leg

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.490 
really remarkable now throwing a leg
over<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.030> felt<00:01:10.480> that<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.720> bike<00:01:10.900> was<00:01:11.110> kind<00:01:11.440> of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
over it I felt that the bike was kind of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.230 
over it I felt that the bike was kind of
tall<00:01:11.740> but<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.070> really<00:01:12.310> wasn't<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> case<00:01:12.850> as

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
tall but that really wasn't the case as

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.990 
tall but that really wasn't the case as
you'll<00:01:13.450> see<00:01:13.660> here<00:01:13.900> so<00:01:14.350> yeah<00:01:14.590> I<00:01:14.620> would<00:01:14.980> say<00:01:15.010> you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
you'll see here so yeah I would say you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.030 
you'll see here so yeah I would say you
know<00:01:16.090> what<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.480> it's<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.230> seats<00:01:17.500> not<00:01:17.620> very

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
know what it is it's the seats not very

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.580 
know what it is it's the seats not very
high<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:18.580> just<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.000> it's<00:01:19.120> wide<00:01:19.420> that's<00:01:20.230> why

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
high it's just that it's wide that's why

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.830 
high it's just that it's wide that's why
I<00:01:20.860> found<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.550> narrower<00:01:22.030> bike<00:01:22.300> I<00:01:22.600> can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
I found that a narrower bike I can

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.420 
I found that a narrower bike I can
actually<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.620> can<00:01:23.650> put<00:01:23.830> your<00:01:24.070> foot<00:01:24.250> further

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
actually you can put your foot further

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.530 
actually you can put your foot further
down<00:01:25.980> but<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.070> still<00:01:27.340> get<00:01:27.490> both<00:01:28.320> both<00:01:29.320> feet<00:01:29.590> down

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
down but I still get both both feet down

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.240 
down but I still get both both feet down
pretty<00:01:31.540> well<00:01:31.630> okay<00:01:32.020> but<00:01:32.200> yeah<00:01:32.380> it's<00:01:32.980> really

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
pretty well okay but yeah it's really

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.810 
pretty well okay but yeah it's really
wide<00:01:33.520> here<00:01:33.910> in<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.660> seat<00:01:35.160> now<00:01:36.160> what<00:01:36.310> exactly<00:01:36.790> I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
wide here in the seat now what exactly I

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.510 
wide here in the seat now what exactly I
meant<00:01:37.150> by<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:38.320> seat<00:01:38.590> height<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:39.070> low

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
meant by that is the seat height is low

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.470 
meant by that is the seat height is low
but<00:01:40.120> because<00:01:40.570> it's<00:01:41.400> relatively<00:01:42.400> wide<00:01:42.730> you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
but because it's relatively wide you

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.120 
but because it's relatively wide you
actually<00:01:44.430> lose<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.850> little<00:01:46.090> bit<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:47.650> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
actually lose a little bit of of a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.890 
actually lose a little bit of of a
footprint<00:01:48.580> when<00:01:49.180> you're<00:01:49.300> trying<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.600> put<00:01:49.720> both

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
footprint when you're trying to put both

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.720 
footprint when you're trying to put both
of<00:01:50.050> your<00:01:50.200> feet<00:01:50.410> down<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.400> would<00:01:51.610> apply

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
of your feet down and this would apply

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.820 
of your feet down and this would apply
particularly<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.540> shorter<00:01:52.960> riders<00:01:53.290> but<00:01:53.770> I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
particularly to a shorter riders but I

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.280 
particularly to a shorter riders but I
was<00:01:54.130> not<00:01:54.340> uncomfortable<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.690> bike<00:01:55.870> which

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
was not uncomfortable on the bike which

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.470 
was not uncomfortable on the bike which
was<00:01:56.320> probably<00:01:57.040> what<00:01:57.460> was<00:01:57.580> conveyed<00:01:57.820> as<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.330> was

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
was probably what was conveyed as I was

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.960 
was probably what was conveyed as I was
sitting<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.050> bike<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.890> bike<00:02:00.100> seating

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
sitting on the bike the bike seating

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.810 
sitting on the bike the bike seating
position<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.990> handlebars<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.820> extremely

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
position to the handlebars is extremely

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.360 
position to the handlebars is extremely
comfortable<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:05.380> have<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.740> say<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.190> I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
comfortable and I have to say that I

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.800 
comfortable and I have to say that I
have<00:02:06.760> probably<00:02:07.210> never<00:02:07.420> been<00:02:07.630> more

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
have probably never been more

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.619 
have probably never been more
comfortable<00:02:08.349> on<00:02:08.560> another<00:02:09.039> bike<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:10.509> are

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
comfortable on another bike there are

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.240 
comfortable on another bike there are
very<00:02:10.840> few<00:02:11.080> bikes<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.560> feel<00:02:11.830> absolutely

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
very few bikes that I feel absolutely

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.380 
very few bikes that I feel absolutely
like<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.570> like<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.710> know

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
like really like this is it you know

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.550 
like really like this is it you know
um<00:02:16.130> some<00:02:17.130> remarkable<00:02:17.670> things<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.270> key<00:02:19.260> points

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
um some remarkable things and key points

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.620 
um some remarkable things and key points
about<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.160> bike<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.360> fuel

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
about this bike is that the fuel

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.050 
about this bike is that the fuel
actually<00:02:22.140> fits<00:02:22.350> inside<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.950> frame<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
actually fits inside the frame and the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.830 
actually fits inside the frame and the
oil<00:02:24.240> actually<00:02:24.600> goes<00:02:25.020> inside<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.740> swingarm

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
oil actually goes inside the swingarm

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
oil actually goes inside the swingarm
that's<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.080> 883<00:02:28.590> motor<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.280> short<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.700> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that's at 883 motor the short this is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.810 
that's at 883 motor the short this is
the<00:02:30.030> short<00:02:30.300> stroke<00:02:30.660> motor<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.890> 1200<00:02:32.520> has<00:02:32.640> got

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the short stroke motor the 1200 has got

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.400 
the short stroke motor the 1200 has got
a<00:02:32.850> longer<00:02:33.270> stroke<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:37.020> think<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
a longer stroke to it and I think this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.140 
a longer stroke to it and I think this
has<00:02:37.590> actually<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> higher<00:02:38.430> top<00:02:38.730> end<00:02:38.970> than<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
has actually a higher top end than the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.660 
has actually a higher top end than the
1200<00:02:40.130> RPM<00:02:41.130> boys<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.580> will<00:02:41.970> top<00:02:42.209> speed<00:02:42.540> yeah<00:02:43.670> yeah

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
1200 RPM boys I will top speed yeah yeah

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.960 
1200 RPM boys I will top speed yeah yeah
I<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:44.790> um<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:46.590> push<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.069> like<00:02:47.220> 135

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I think um you can push it to like 135

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.170 
I think um you can push it to like 135
140<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.630> think<00:02:48.870> that's<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:49.650> it'll<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.180> do

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
140 I think that's you know it'll do do

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.400 
140 I think that's you know it'll do do
all<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:52.790> now<00:02:53.790> again<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.570> frame<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.260> this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
all of that now again the frame of this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.190 
all of that now again the frame of this
bike<00:02:55.650> was<00:02:55.920> designed<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:57.209> Italy<00:02:58.170> and<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
bike was designed in Italy and the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.259 
bike was designed in Italy and the
engine<00:03:01.650> was<00:03:02.130> made<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.730> Milwaukee

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
engine was made in Milwaukee

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.020 
engine was made in Milwaukee
now<00:03:03.720> what<00:03:03.870> erik<00:03:04.110> buell<00:03:04.410> did<00:03:04.709> with<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.640> braking

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
now what erik buell did with the braking

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.979 
now what erik buell did with the braking
design<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.830> called<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.220> ztl<00:03:09.060> it's

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
design is that this is called a ztl it's

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.340 
design is that this is called a ztl it's
called<00:03:10.260> zero<00:03:10.560> torsional<00:03:11.250> load<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:12.840> actually

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
called zero torsional load it's actually

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.650 
called zero torsional load it's actually
also<00:03:13.530> thirty<00:03:14.280> percent<00:03:14.730> less<00:03:14.850> mass<00:03:15.360> than<00:03:15.630> a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
also thirty percent less mass than a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.020 
also thirty percent less mass than a
conventional<00:03:15.870> braking<00:03:16.680> system<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.760> was

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
conventional braking system this was

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.880 
conventional braking system this was
supposed<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.450> relieve<00:03:18.750> stress<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.590> front

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
supposed to relieve stress on the front

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.819 
supposed to relieve stress on the front
suspension<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.850> braking<00:03:21.450> maneuvers<00:03:21.570> as<00:03:22.110> well

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
suspension in braking maneuvers as well

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.520 
suspension in braking maneuvers as well
as<00:03:23.010> reducing<00:03:23.610> weight<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.360> bike<00:03:24.540> now<00:03:25.500> I

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
as reducing weight on the bike now I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.650 
as reducing weight on the bike now I
don't<00:03:25.860> like<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.340> way<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.910> stock<00:03:27.180> exhaust

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
don't like the way the stock exhaust

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.479 
don't like the way the stock exhaust
sounds<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.560> bike<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> probably

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
sounds on this bike and you probably

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.850 
sounds on this bike and you probably
won't<00:03:29.910> either<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> won't<00:03:30.989> blame<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.290> if<00:03:31.680> you

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
won't either so I won't blame you if you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.759 
won't either so I won't blame you if you
like<00:03:32.130> complain<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:33.989> um<00:03:34.230> there's

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
like complain about it but um there's

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.120 
like complain about it but um there's
some<00:03:35.040> much<00:03:35.160> better<00:03:35.340> clips<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:36.000> exhaust<00:03:36.540> like

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
some much better clips of exhaust like

00:03:37.130 --> 00:04:04.700 
some much better clips of exhaust like
aftermarket<00:03:38.130> exhausts<00:03:38.579> for<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.940> bike

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.570 

and<00:04:05.710> there<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.010> is

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
and there it is

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.500 
and there it is
the<00:04:06.730> 2003<00:04:07.890> Buell<00:04:08.940> xb9<00:04:09.940> s<00:04:10.510> lightning
