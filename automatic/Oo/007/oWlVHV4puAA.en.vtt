00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.750
 It's saga but this season equal the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.300

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.520
 have you asked this time I'll call 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.739

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.840
 sequel to the first season finally 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.750

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.629
 before I start, I want to clarify that 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.940
 all images and songs 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.500

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 it comes are not from my audit are 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.100
 compilations found on the internet 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.100
 and la la la la la let's start now 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.040
 I wonder what would have happened if 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.140
 we would never have gone to that place was 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.600
 our destiny or just happened what 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.010
 what had to happen I miss you so much 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.980
 since you left everything has changed 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.800
 drastically I just want to tell you 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.920
 that Mr. Ruiz does not seem to be 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.840
 paying attention to my classes I ask 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.630
 get out of my class right now 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.850
 I would pay attention if I talked about more things 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.729
 important 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.789

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.969

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.709
