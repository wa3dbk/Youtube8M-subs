00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
lapse into GoPro Studios 2.0 so I've got

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.880 
lapse into GoPro Studios 2.0 so I've got
GoPros<00:00:17.780> to<00:00:17.900> use<00:00:18.050> open<00:00:18.200> and<00:00:18.590> I've<00:00:18.680> got<00:00:18.860> a

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
GoPros to use open and I've got a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.310 
GoPros to use open and I've got a
timeline<00:00:19.490> I<00:00:19.609> got<00:00:19.760> a<00:00:19.789> file<00:00:20.090> folder<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:20.689> it

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
timeline I got a file folder and it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.179 
timeline I got a file folder and it
contains<00:00:22.029> 2104<00:00:23.029> in<00:00:23.119> any<00:00:23.210> images<00:00:23.539> of<00:00:24.189> the

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
contains 2104 in any images of the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.609 
contains 2104 in any images of the
time-lapse<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:26.029> what<00:00:26.990> I'm<00:00:27.050> going<00:00:27.170> to<00:00:27.230> do<00:00:27.410> is

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
time-lapse so what I'm going to do is

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.429 
time-lapse so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:27.740> going<00:00:27.769> to<00:00:27.890> select<00:00:28.009> all<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.400> them<00:00:29.230> ctrl<00:00:30.230> a

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
I'm going to select all of them ctrl a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.080 
I'm going to select all of them ctrl a
and<00:00:30.679> then<00:00:30.980> I'm<00:00:31.070> going<00:00:31.189> to<00:00:31.250> click<00:00:31.519> and<00:00:31.759> drag

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
and then I'm going to click and drag

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.430 
and then I'm going to click and drag
them<00:00:32.300> into<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:36.110> import<00:00:36.650> side<00:00:37.490> of<00:00:38.440> GoPro

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
them into the import side of GoPro

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.100 
them into the import side of GoPro
Studios<00:00:40.400> so<00:00:40.700> this<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:40.910> in<00:00:41.060> step<00:00:41.270> one<00:00:41.450> it's<00:00:42.020> the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
Studios so this is in step one it's the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.290 
Studios so this is in step one it's the
important<00:00:42.560> converts<00:00:42.890> death<00:00:43.130> and<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.060> I<00:00:44.120> can

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
important converts death and then I can

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.270 
important converts death and then I can
just<00:00:44.450> open<00:00:44.990> it<00:00:45.140> up<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:45.560> can<00:00:45.680> see<00:00:45.860> here<00:00:46.100> now

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
just open it up and you can see here now

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.030 
just open it up and you can see here now
the<00:00:47.030> time<00:00:47.690> lapse<00:00:47.900> has<00:00:48.050> been<00:00:48.200> imported<00:00:48.740> and<00:00:48.830> it

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
the time lapse has been imported and it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.980 
the time lapse has been imported and it
just<00:00:49.220> sits<00:00:49.430> there<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:50.000> behaving<00:00:50.720> like<00:00:50.930> a

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
just sits there and it's behaving like a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.570 
just sits there and it's behaving like a
video<00:00:51.260> clip<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.680> software<00:00:52.250> thinks<00:00:52.460> that

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
video clip the software thinks that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.610 
video clip the software thinks that
there's<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.790> one<00:00:52.970> minute<00:00:53.150> an<00:00:53.690> 11<00:00:54.050> second<00:00:54.410> video

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
there's a one minute an 11 second video

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.910 
there's a one minute an 11 second video
clip<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.690> can<00:00:56.810> hit<00:00:56.930> play<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.560> can<00:00:57.650> see

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
clip so you can hit play and you can see

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.660 
clip so you can hit play and you can see
now<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.340> plays<00:00:58.580> through<00:00:58.790> just<00:00:59.090> like<00:00:59.510> a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
now that it plays through just like a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.030 
now that it plays through just like a
normal<00:01:01.670> video<00:01:02.150> would<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:03.890> you're

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
normal video would and if you're

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.380 
normal video would and if you're
thinking<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:04.430> there's<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.760> flickering<00:01:05.089> going

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
thinking that there's a flickering going

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.599 
thinking that there's a flickering going
on<00:01:05.540> here<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.530> video<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.159> because<00:01:07.280> there

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
on here in the video it's because there

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.990 
on here in the video it's because there
is<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.060> was<00:01:08.689> caused<00:01:08.960> by<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:10.520> camera<00:01:10.789> trying

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
is that was caused by the camera trying

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.779 
is that was caused by the camera trying
to<00:01:11.530> correct<00:01:12.530> for<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> exposure<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.640> it

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
to correct for the exposure and it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.160 
to correct for the exposure and it
changing<00:01:14.240> depending<00:01:14.359> on<00:01:14.689> how<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.840> light<00:01:14.899> was

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
changing depending on how the light was

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.529 
changing depending on how the light was
because<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.500> was<00:01:15.619> very<00:01:16.000> fickle<00:01:17.000> light<00:01:17.329> with

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
because it was very fickle light with

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:18.819 
because it was very fickle light with
the<00:01:17.689> clouds<00:01:17.929> there<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.499> was<00:01:18.619> why<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
the clouds there so that was why the

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.060 
the clouds there so that was why the
beginning<00:01:19.189> of<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:19.399> video<00:01:19.490> was<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.880> little<00:01:19.909> bit

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
beginning of that video was a little bit

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.989 
beginning of that video was a little bit
flickery<00:01:22.070> now<00:01:22.999> if<00:01:23.329> we<00:01:23.590> add<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.950> clip<00:01:25.549> here<00:01:25.789> to

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
flickery now if we add this clip here to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:31.719 
flickery now if we add this clip here to
our<00:01:26.119> conversion<00:01:26.570> list<00:01:30.249> it'll<00:01:31.249> come<00:01:31.399> up<00:01:31.520> the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
our conversion list it'll come up the

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.809 
our conversion list it'll come up the
full<00:01:32.030> length<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.359> it<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:32.630> can't<00:01:32.899> convert<00:01:33.819> it'll

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
full length of it we can't convert it'll

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.059 
full length of it we can't convert it'll
get<00:01:34.880> processed<00:01:35.450> now<00:01:36.140> it'll<00:01:36.380> probably<00:01:36.590> very

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
get processed now it'll probably very

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.580 
get processed now it'll probably very
slow<00:01:37.399> processing<00:01:37.909> because<00:01:38.179> these<00:01:38.299> are<00:01:38.450> very

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
slow processing because these are very

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.620 
slow processing because these are very
large<00:01:39.590> images<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.369> image<00:01:40.670> files<00:01:40.939> here<00:01:41.539> are

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
large images the image files here are

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.739 
large images the image files here are
about<00:01:41.689> twice<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.280> or<00:01:44.149> four<00:01:44.479> times

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
about twice that of the or four times

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.230 
about twice that of the or four times
the<00:01:44.960> size<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.499> a<00:01:45.710> normal<00:01:45.829> GoPro<00:01:46.429> video<00:01:46.969> so

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the size of a normal GoPro video so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.389 
the size of a normal GoPro video so
it'll<00:01:47.450> take<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.630> while<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.899> get<00:01:48.319> to<00:01:48.799> render<00:01:49.280> it

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
it'll take a while to get to render it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.819 
it'll take a while to get to render it
out

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.410 

so<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:52.920> soon<00:01:53.039> as<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.219> completed<00:01:53.789> rendering

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so as soon as you completed rendering

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.300 
so as soon as you completed rendering
the<00:01:54.509> video<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.200> go<00:01:55.380> ahead<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.890> jump<00:01:56.100> into

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the video you can go ahead and jump into

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.359 
the video you can go ahead and jump into
step<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.289> then<00:01:58.289> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:58.950> your

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
step two and then you can see that your

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.270 
step two and then you can see that your
video<00:01:59.700> clip<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:02.009> just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
video clip will be or the time up just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
video clip will be or the time up just
now<00:02:02.369> rendered<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> video<00:02:03.210> clip<00:02:03.420> will<00:02:03.570> be
