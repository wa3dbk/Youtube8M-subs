and press ok it will now go through a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
and press ok it will now go through a
process<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.800> converting<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> model<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
process of converting the model and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:23.060 
process of converting the model and
importing<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.770> program

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.490 

now<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.310> your<00:01:24.460> model<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.060> loaded<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:26.080> next

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
now that your model is loaded the next

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.250 
now that your model is loaded the next
step<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.010> assign<00:01:27.670> materials<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:28.930> colors

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
step is to assign materials and colors

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.900 
step is to assign materials and colors
to<00:01:29.980> each<00:01:30.400> specific<00:01:30.910> part<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:32.830> do<00:01:33.010> this<00:01:33.250> you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
to each specific part to do this you

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.370 
to each specific part to do this you
will<00:01:34.120> go<00:01:34.270> up<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.950> appearance<00:01:36.760> tab<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.540> go

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
will go up to the appearance tab and go

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:56.010 
will go up to the appearance tab and go
to<00:01:38.700> materials<00:01:39.700> library<00:01:54.330> once<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.630> loaded

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
to materials library once it is loaded

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.620 
to materials library once it is loaded
as<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.130> can<00:01:57.340> see<00:01:57.550> on<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.880> left<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.600> have

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
as you can see on the left you have

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.380 
as you can see on the left you have
different<00:01:59.380> toolbars<00:01:59.650> if<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:01.000> go<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
different toolbars if you go to the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.020 
different toolbars if you go to the
showcase<00:02:01.810> materials<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:03.040> comes<00:02:03.490> up<00:02:03.729> with<00:02:04.000> a
