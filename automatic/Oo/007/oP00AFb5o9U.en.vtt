 giant slalom 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.530
 I'm going to opt for the slopestyle 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.949
 since not the player too much and good 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.949
 a player 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.610
 and I 'm going to choose to see 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.500
 and who could choose 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.210
 well 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 based same come 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 and good first of all it's hour I with 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.570
 62 points and let's see if we get 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.570
 beat that score 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.140
 ok i'm going to charge myself with energy 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.790
 and come on 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.720
 to see if I remember more or less how 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.000
 this come out and ghost to see we go 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.590
 good 1080 is not bad at all I'll go 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 towards the one on the right that seems the most 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.580
 hard 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.080
 I did not care to turn not damn 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.080
 well, nothing left again 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.560
 it jumps perfect 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.560
 perfect to see here 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.260
 by little but good is not bad 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.120
 to see here makes a good jump to see 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.319
 go Go 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.030
 that's that's good 1440 degrees are not 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.170
 not bad 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.970
 come on let's go let's go another 1440 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.210
 I'm going to fuck well 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.060
 perfect goes up here shadow that's 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.130
 Be careful not to fall 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.290
 perfect good the truth is that I'm going 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.819
 pretty good 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.640
 they are taking me out all the time 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.020
 points but good is not bad 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.220
 and let's go now the last jump 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.220
 come on let's go shadow 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.290
 well an 1800 degrees that is nothing 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.549
 badly you have subtracted a thousand as not 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.230
 let's see if he has managed to beat the 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.140
 wario score 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.420
 I think so 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.710
 if I have managed to overcome war I 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.130
 speed 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.830
 and in figures that is to say the jumps also 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.819
 one not so high so to speak but 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.819
 well, nothing else 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.550
 and well I 'm going to skip this 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.830
 let's see I'm going to select an event 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.520
 different 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.300
 maybe something fantasy to change 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.590
 and this is pretty durable 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.590
 and I could play to see 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.950
 I'm going to play a vile sled race 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.770
 bullet and the truth is that it 's pretty 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.290
 entertaining 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.290
 and see which characters I choose 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:20.319
 I'm going to choose luigi and 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.319
 whom you have and come 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.840
 ok we face vector and knuckles 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.820
 ekman and sonic a somewhat strange team 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.820
 equal i equal luigi 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.619
 to see ready 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.440
 come on let's go more or less remember 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.080
 how was this the truth is that it makes 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.050
 time I do not play 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.819
 since I stopped doing the display only 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.189
 played once or twice more or less but 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.530
 the truth is that he is very handsome but 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:20.289
 the theme of time and all this because I have not 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.759
 had almost no time to play the 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.189
 only free time that I have I dedicate it 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.430
 to record is to say right now by 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.440
 example 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.520
 perfect 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.930
 and then to play games like that 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.180
 of recording I do not have too much 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.710
 time but especially midweek 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.900
 well sooner or later I'll follow it out 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.430
 I should have gone to the right but 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.480
 I did not remember the shortcut 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.910
 but in the end let's go that's salt is 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.370
 perfect 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.920
 for now we go third that 's pretty 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.720
 bad position the truth to see if I get 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.820
 go back a little 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.520
 for example now yes it takes perfect 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.040
 ok let's go in second position first 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.750
 come on let's go let my mother push me 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.580
 outside 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.810
 are giving of hosts is good I 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.020
 I'm also giving some other 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.020
 already 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.689
 almost hit me against the ceiling come 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:21.889
 let's go for now we're not going bad 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.889
 if I continue like this 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.300
 let's use this come perfect this 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.190
 kind of accelerator the turbo better said 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.110
 yes and now I'm going to the 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.500
 right good if you leave me mother of mine 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.500
 they have burst 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:41.289
 let's run 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.330
 come, come, come 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.210

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.470
 it has not left me I go back out mother 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.190

 it drives me crazy sledge go and no 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.770
 got there and good second 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.080
 position is not wrong 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.129
 for very little in or stayed first but 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.129
 good that of being going to do 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.070
 and good kids, I'm going to leave 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.770
 here the video I know that it is very short what 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.390
 I feel but the truth this streak of 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.030
 have so little time I guess it's 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.650
 will end more or less this week like this 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.840
 that by the end of this week you will have 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.120
 normal videos of between 15 and 20 minutes 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.670
 and well I feel that lately the 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.230
 videos are so short I hope that you 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.230
 I liked the video and until next time
