00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:10.260
 first of all the tool requirements for 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 tool hardest punch 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.440
 drills for perforator 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.810
 vacuum pump drill 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.790
 gauge manifold locksmith 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.690
 tool 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:28.000
 rolling example only special 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.930
 professional tool can 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.380
 provide high quality installation 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.660
 further work is done by installers not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.570
 everyone can be trusted with this stage 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.480
 works because 70 percent of breakdowns 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 conditioners occur due to errors and 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.270
 low quality installation 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.640
 competent choice of place is very important 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.210
 installation of indoor unit 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.309
 he must secure on the one hand 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.760
 customer comfort on the other hand 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.360
 ensure sufficient workability 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 montage 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.490
 and in the future maintenance 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.609
 the installation of the indoor unit must 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.459
 produced in strict compliance 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:18.189
 installation instructions for air conditioners so 

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.310
 indoor unit must be installed 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.749
 strictly horizontally using 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.279
 level dividing the air conditioner into two parts 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:32.670
 in the indoor unit only remains 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:37.329
 fan almost silently chasing 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.170
 air to connect the internal and 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.279
 outdoor units split system 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.159
 used special 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:46.779
 copper tubes that should be 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.179
 insulated 

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:52.060
 while repairing these tubes 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.869
 can be laid in the wall and after it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.079
 graduation 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.709
 only hang blocks if it is 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.789
 impossible then copper pipes are laying 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:06.520
 in decorative boxes 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.289
 in the manufacture of compounds used 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.470
 special tool 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.890
 rolling from accuracy and durability 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.100
 making a compound depends 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
 durable 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.680
 and reliable air conditioner operation 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.240
 pre-cut copper tube 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 necessarily heat insulated 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.410
 special material for the entire length 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.140
 connections 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.860
 an extra piece of pipe is cut off the pipe 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.460
 as shown on the screen 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.830
 align the squeezed edges of the tube and 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.930
 we clean we clean the burrs and small 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.810
 irregularities on the treated end of the tube 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.160
 the return nut is put on after which 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.310
 the tube is clamped in the vice of rolling and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.430
 expanding INDICATES providing reliable 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.560
 one side connection is long 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.680
 a tube attached to the indoor unit and 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.230
 the other end is displayed to the place 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.230
 mounting the outdoor unit 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.040
 the summer phase will be closing 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.040
 decorative box 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.230
 installation of the outdoor unit begins with 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.140
 choice of installation location and method 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.090
 mounting brackets application 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.630
 relevant materials when 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.470
 fastening brackets provides 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.139
 the reliability of the mounting block external unit 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:31.010
 these are 2 components of our air conditioner 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:35.360
 in which all the noisy ones are installed 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.510
 compressor parts heat exchangers and so 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.680
 further for harsh climatic conditions 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.860
 Russia provides model system 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.310
 defrosting 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.970
 external blocks and restrictions on 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.210
 switching on blocks at temperatures below 15 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.270
 degrees can additionally be set 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.460
 air conditioner heaters that 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.790
 allow the unit to operate at minus 22 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.030
 -26 degrees 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.050
 installation is usually done at height 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.729
 therefore it is necessary to use 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.940
 special protective equipment for workers 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:19.040
 after installing and securing the unit 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.830
 the connection is made 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.410
 now for the outdoor unit 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.900
 after connecting the manufactured 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.229
 connections and electrical cables 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.720
 start work related to the start-up 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.690
 air conditioner is used 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.210
 vacuum pump and gauge 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.919
 collector 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.330
 vacuum pump is used for 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:47.000
 remove air from the highway 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.700
 made of copper pipes and vacuum 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.070
 drying that ensures the absence of 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.650
 gas impurities of which consists 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.229
 the atmosphere as well as the lack 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.810
 water vapor at the same time 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.770
 made the first check on 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.080
 line tightness after above 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.750
 specified process is performed 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.590
 opening the outdoor unit taps 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:16.220
 what provides filling highway 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:19.430
 In our case, the refrigerant is freon r22 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:24.230
 and at the same time produced the second 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:26.900
 leak test at the end 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.570
 checks made refueling 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.350
 air conditioning refrigerant if 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.860
 is necessary 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.920
 start and performance check 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.160
 air conditioner in all available modes 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.160
 work 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.710
 and finally you need to train the client how 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.699
 use the air conditioner correctly and 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.570
 control panel enabling 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:06.310
 regulate heating mode cooling 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.050
 determining and maintaining temperature in 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.110
 indoors 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:13.630
 changes in air circulation 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.840
 decrease in its humidity at what 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.910
 outdoor climatic conditions 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.949
 it is advisable to use it in 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.949
 certain modes of operation
