our channel so go check out that if you
haven't<00:01:19.630> already<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.400> this<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.820> it

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
haven't already and so that this is it

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.149 
haven't already and so that this is it
looks<00:01:22.570> like<00:01:22.720> it's<00:01:22.870> gonna<00:01:22.990> be<00:01:23.320> unveiled<00:01:23.890> or

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
looks like it's gonna be unveiled or

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.010 
looks like it's gonna be unveiled or
launched<00:01:24.760> we're<00:01:25.000> not<00:01:25.119> too<00:01:25.270> sure<00:01:25.299> which<00:01:25.750> one

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
launched we're not too sure which one

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.960 
launched we're not too sure which one
but<00:01:26.229> judging<00:01:27.040> by<00:01:27.070> this<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.520> looks<00:01:27.640> like<00:01:27.850> an

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
but judging by this it looks like an

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.330 
but judging by this it looks like an
invitation<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:29.170> it's<00:01:29.409> most<00:01:29.710> likely<00:01:29.860> going<00:01:30.160> to

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
invitation so it's most likely going to

invitation so it's most likely going to
be<00:01:30.600> maybe<00:01:31.600> like<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:32.500> gonna<00:01:32.680> be<00:01:32.830> unveiled<00:01:33.370> on

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
corner and again like I said this is a

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.590 
corner and again like I said this is a
leaked<00:01:46.720> poster<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.970> says<00:01:49.180> need<00:01:49.450> a

new generation coming so that's what's
obviously<00:01:52.210> hinting<00:01:52.660> at<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.680> new

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
obviously hinting at it's a new

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.950 
obviously hinting at it's a new
generation<00:01:54.460> it's<00:01:54.850> gonna<00:01:54.940> be<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.150> big<00:01:55.510> change

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
generation it's gonna be a big change

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.400 
generation it's gonna be a big change
from<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.730> galaxy<00:01:57.730> s2<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.360> apparently<00:01:59.260> this

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
from the galaxy s2 and apparently this

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.210 
from the galaxy s2 and apparently this
is<00:01:59.560> going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.770> be<00:02:00.480> hosted<00:02:01.480> in<00:02:01.630> London<00:02:02.290> UK<00:02:02.800> and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
is going to be hosted in London UK and

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.580 
is going to be hosted in London UK and
so<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.000> again<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.990> kind<00:02:05.470> of

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
so that again that that kind of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.710 
so that again that that kind of
certifies<00:02:06.070> room<00:02:06.430> that's<00:02:06.910> kind<00:02:07.150> of<00:02:07.240> clarifies

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
certifies room that's kind of clarifies

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.419 
certifies room that's kind of clarifies
that<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.080> may<00:02:08.289> twenty<00:02:08.709> second<00:02:09.009> date<00:02:09.159> over

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
that the may twenty second date over

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.640 
that the may twenty second date over
there<00:02:09.580> it's<00:02:10.030> probably<00:02:10.300> referring<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.200> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
there it's probably referring to the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.309 
there it's probably referring to the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
go over some oh yeah so one thing that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.860 
go over some oh yeah so one thing that
about<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.159> poster<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.760> seemed<00:02:22.300> just<00:02:22.780> by

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
about the poster it seemed just by

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.320 
about the poster it seemed just by
looking<00:02:23.319> at<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.500> actually<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.980> saw<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.909> it<00:02:25.120> has

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
looking at it actually I saw that it has

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.020 
looking at it actually I saw that it has
an<00:02:25.540> aluminum<00:02:25.870> body<00:02:26.800> I'm<00:02:27.340> not<00:02:27.640> sure<00:02:27.700> if<00:02:27.940> you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
an aluminum body I'm not sure if you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.850 
an aluminum body I'm not sure if you
guys<00:02:28.209> saw<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:28.659> just<00:02:29.200> judging<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.620> at<00:02:29.739> that

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
guys saw but just judging you at that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.949 
guys saw but just judging you at that
poster<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.519> seems<00:02:31.090> like<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.569> gonna<00:02:31.659> have<00:02:31.870> an

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
poster it seems like it's gonna have an

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.020 
poster it seems like it's gonna have an
aluminum<00:02:32.409> body<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:33.159> don't<00:02:33.639> think<00:02:33.879> it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
aluminum body I I don't think it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.479 
aluminum body I I don't think it's
plastic<00:02:34.689> running<00:02:35.349> around<00:02:35.530> beside<00:02:35.829> its<00:02:36.219> most

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
plastic running around beside its most

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.870 
plastic running around beside its most
likely<00:02:36.609> gonna<00:02:36.849> be<00:02:36.999> aluminum

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
likely gonna be aluminum

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.720 
likely gonna be aluminum
and<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.740> plastic<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.460> very

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and it's it's because plastic is a very

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.340 
and it's it's because plastic is a very
cheap<00:02:41.060> material<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.690> obviously<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.200> don't

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
cheap material and obviously I don't

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.160 
cheap material and obviously I don't
think<00:02:42.800> Samsung<00:02:43.250> will<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:44.330> plastic<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:44.990> time

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
think Samsung will do plastic this time

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.290 
think Samsung will do plastic this time
around<00:02:45.320> for<00:02:45.590> their<00:02:45.740> next<00:02:45.920> Galaxy<00:02:46.700> S<00:02:46.940> device

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
around for their next Galaxy S device

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.340 
around for their next Galaxy S device
since<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.200> their<00:02:48.470> main<00:02:49.060> featured

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
since this is their main featured

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.160 
since this is their main featured
handset<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:52.490> now<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.940> also<00:02:53.330> another<00:02:53.720> thing<00:02:53.870> is

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
handset so now and also another thing is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.170 
handset so now and also another thing is
that<00:02:54.320> there's<00:02:54.530> no<00:02:54.680> physical<00:02:55.280> buttons<00:02:55.790> it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
that there's no physical buttons it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.640 
that there's no physical buttons it
looks<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:56.960> gonna<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.410> screen

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
looks like it's all gonna be on screen

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.770 
looks like it's all gonna be on screen
which<00:02:57.920> again<00:02:58.160> leads<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:58.760> talk<00:02:59.330> about<00:02:59.480> ice

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
which again leads to talk about ice

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.900 
which again leads to talk about ice
cream<00:02:59.840> sandwich<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.070> device<00:03:01.220> again

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
cream sandwich for this device again

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.880 
cream sandwich for this device again
that<00:03:02.150> was<00:03:02.300> all<00:03:02.480> leaked<00:03:02.750> before<00:03:02.990> we<00:03:03.440> did<00:03:03.620> cover

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
that was all leaked before we did cover

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.760 
that was all leaked before we did cover
here<00:03:04.310> play<00:03:04.580> infinite<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.320> yeah<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:06.560> the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
here play infinite and yeah so the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.320 
here play infinite and yeah so the
screen<00:03:06.920> size<00:03:07.160> looks<00:03:07.340> large<00:03:08.060> enough<00:03:08.270> to

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
screen size looks large enough to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.750 
screen size looks large enough to
support<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.770> on-screen<00:03:10.070> buttons<00:03:10.520> as

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
support and the on-screen buttons as

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.130 
support and the on-screen buttons as
well<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.030> ice<00:03:11.120> cream<00:03:11.360> sandwich<00:03:11.660> again<00:03:11.960> I'm

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
well as ice cream sandwich again I'm

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.810 
well as ice cream sandwich again I'm
saying<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.500> looks<00:03:12.860> large<00:03:13.250> enough<00:03:13.460> because

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
saying it looks large enough because

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.280 
saying it looks large enough because
again<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.690> can't<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.110> whole<00:03:15.260> picture

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
again you can't see the whole picture

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.020 
again you can't see the whole picture
from<00:03:15.710> this<00:03:15.890> way<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.130> could<00:03:16.400> tell<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> couple<00:03:16.850> of

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
from this way you could tell a couple of

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.730 
from this way you could tell a couple of
things<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.420> anyway<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:18.080> now<00:03:18.320> I'm<00:03:18.440> going<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.650> go

things and anyway so now I'm going to go
through<00:03:18.980> some<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.490> features<00:03:19.520> some<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.210> the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
through some of the features some of the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.050 
through some of the features some of the
specs<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.810> been<00:03:21.020> linked<00:03:21.260> before<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.880> might

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
specs have been linked before you might

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.250 
specs have been linked before you might
have<00:03:23.210> missed<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:23.810> I'm<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.080> going<00:03:24.200> to

have missed it so I'm just going to
quickly<00:03:24.410> run<00:03:24.710> through<00:03:24.770> it<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.700> gonna

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
quickly run through it so it's gonna
