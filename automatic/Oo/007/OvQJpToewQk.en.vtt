00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
of videos on youtube on how to make that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.619 
of videos on youtube on how to make that
protein<00:00:38.070> treatment<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
protein treatment so but you really have

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.770 
protein treatment so but you really have
to<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> search<00:00:40.110> protein<00:00:40.530> treatment<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.160> like

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
to do a search protein treatment or like

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.860 
to do a search protein treatment or like
man<00:00:42.780> mayo<00:00:43.379> treatment<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.160> egg<00:00:45.120> dreaming

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
man mayo treatment or egg dreaming

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
man mayo treatment or egg dreaming
something<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.039> yeah<00:00:47.460> um<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:50.210> guess
