was pretty good let's start with let's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.319 
was pretty good let's start with let's
see<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:36.899> low<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> list<00:00:37.590> voice<00:00:38.550> work<00:00:38.850> okay

ok<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.890> mean<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.850> could<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.210> been<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> lot

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
ok I mean it could have been a lot

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
ok I mean it could have been a lot
better<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> say<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> voices<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.309> use

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579

the<00:00:48.059> big<00:00:48.239> problem<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> me<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.890> fact

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the big problem of me was that the fact

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
the big problem of me was that the fact
that<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.489> used<00:00:50.670> sonic<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.329> knuckles<00:00:51.600> voice

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that they used sonic and knuckles voice

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.799 
that they used sonic and knuckles voice
were<00:00:52.530> near<00:00:52.739> identical<00:00:53.149> because<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.449> got

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
were near identical because it got

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
were near identical because it got
sometimes<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.739> confusing<00:00:56.309> when

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
sometimes it got really confusing when

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.740 
sometimes it got really confusing when
you<00:00:56.489> can't<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:57.180> sometimes<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> can't

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you can't because sometimes you can't

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.849 
you can't because sometimes you can't
even<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:58.020> their<00:00:58.140> mouths<00:00:58.289> moving<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.739> it's

even see their mouths moving so it's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
even see their mouths moving so it's
like<00:00:58.949> oh<00:00:59.070> wait<00:00:59.250> who<00:00:59.430> said<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> sonic

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.670 
I'm a big pokemon fan watched as a kid
and<00:01:54.149> some<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> backgrounds<00:01:55.079> real<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and some of the backgrounds real and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.560 
and some of the backgrounds real and
some<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> animation<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:57.060> remind<00:01:57.390> me

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
some of the animation really remind me

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.359 
some of the animation really remind me
of<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.320> overall<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
of it but overall it was kind of

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.080 
of it but overall it was kind of
simplistic<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.630> no<00:02:00.840> idea<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.680> this

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
simplistic but I have no idea when this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.399 
simplistic but I have no idea when this
thing<00:02:03.090> came<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.750> ever<00:02:03.840> did<00:02:04.200> I'm

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
thing came out but when ever did I'm

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.569 
thing came out but when ever did I'm
pretty<00:02:04.619> sure<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.829> either<00:02:04.920> 80s<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.520> 90s

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
pretty sure it was either 80s or 90s

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.059 
pretty sure it was either 80s or 90s
either<00:02:06.240> way<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.439> say<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> time

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
either way I have to say for the time

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.660 
either way I have to say for the time
not<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.640> bad<00:02:08.970> animation
