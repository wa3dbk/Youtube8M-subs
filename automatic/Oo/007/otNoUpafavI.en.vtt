00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.430 
and he's gonna die but he has immunity
two<00:03:45.090> basic<00:03:45.420> attacks<00:03:45.780> when<00:03:46.020> he<00:03:46.080> gets<00:03:46.230> low<00:03:46.410> on

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
two basic attacks when he gets low on

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.850 
two basic attacks when he gets low on
health<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.330> not<00:03:48.690> hard<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.530> far<00:03:49.800> I

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
health and this is not hard so far I

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.190 
health and this is not hard so far I
think<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.460> is<00:03:50.610> pretty<00:03:50.850> easy<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.140> get

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
think this is pretty easy now if I get

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.720 
think this is pretty easy now if I get
into<00:03:52.470> trouble<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:53.250> would<00:03:53.430> bring<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:55.100> page<00:03:56.100> first

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
into trouble I would bring in page first

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.480 
into trouble I would bring in page first
and<00:03:57.090> let<00:03:57.690> her<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.080> her<00:03:58.110> first<00:03:58.560> specials<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
and let her do her first specials and

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.880 
and let her do her first specials and
she<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.240> heal<00:04:00.420> herself<00:04:00.630> two<00:04:01.170> on<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
she can heal herself two on that and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.330 
she can heal herself two on that and
then<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> would<00:04:02.640> bring<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:03.030> Stephanie<00:04:04.340> lastly

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.889 

victory<00:05:43.889> not<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.580> lot<00:05:44.879> of<00:05:44.909> gold<00:05:45.239> in<00:05:45.479> this<00:05:45.629> the

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
victory not a lot of gold in this the

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:47.600 
victory not a lot of gold in this the
other<00:05:45.989> thing<00:05:46.259> I<00:05:46.379> like<00:05:46.559> about<00:05:46.589> this<00:05:47.129> is<00:05:47.429> this

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
other thing I like about this is this

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.239 
other thing I like about this is this
allows<00:05:47.999> me<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.360> level<00:05:49.050> up<00:05:49.199> my<00:05:49.229> characters<00:05:50.009> that

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 
allows me to level up my characters that

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.179 
allows me to level up my characters that
are<00:05:50.369> above<00:05:50.610> level<00:05:50.939> 45<00:05:51.649> because<00:05:52.649> I<00:05:52.769> usually

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
are above level 45 because I usually

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.149 
are above level 45 because I usually
farm<00:05:53.729> bonus<00:05:54.269> battle<00:05:54.779> six<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.619> once<00:05:55.800> they<00:05:55.979> get

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
farm bonus battle six and once they get

farm bonus battle six and once they get
to<00:05:56.399> 45<00:05:56.879> they<00:05:57.569> kind<00:05:57.869> of<00:05:57.929> get<00:05:58.050> stalled<00:05:59.029> annexed

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
to 45 they kind of get stalled annexed

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.079 
to 45 they kind of get stalled annexed
F&amp;E<00:06:00.419> could<00:06:00.749> definitely<00:06:00.959> get<00:06:01.589> up<00:06:01.829> to<00:06:02.129> 45<00:06:02.639> pretty

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
F&amp;E could definitely get up to 45 pretty

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.619 
F&amp;E could definitely get up to 45 pretty
quickly

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
quickly

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.229
