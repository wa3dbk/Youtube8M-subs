of course curry vehemently denies right

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
of course curry vehemently denies right
but<00:02:05.189> yeah<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:06.359> do<00:02:06.419> you<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
but yeah what do you think about the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.809 
but yeah what do you think about the
concept<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.439> why<00:02:07.950> don't<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.369> walk<00:02:08.550> away

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.110 
concept of why don't you just walk away
if<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> dude<00:02:09.360> well<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.349> guess<00:02:11.280> from<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
if you're a dude well I guess from the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.809 
if you're a dude well I guess from the
details<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:13.370> if<00:02:14.370> he's<00:02:15.090> kind<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
details of it if he's kind of

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.819 
details of it if he's kind of
it<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:15.999> summer<00:02:16.180> clean<00:02:16.540> up<00:02:16.659> after<00:02:16.989> him<00:02:17.109> that's

it is summer clean up after him that's

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.099 
it is summer clean up after him that's
outside<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.489> his<00:02:18.670> job<00:02:18.969> description<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.930> guess

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
outside of his job description I guess

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.259 
outside of his job description I guess
mm-hmm<00:02:20.739> those<00:02:21.459> are<00:02:21.639> things<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.909> leave<00:02:22.060> over

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
mm-hmm those are things to leave over

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.000 
mm-hmm those are things to leave over

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.020 
he claims according to the New York Post
story<00:02:28.359> that<00:02:29.079> fatty<00:02:29.650> curry<00:02:29.950> said<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.760> you

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.140 
downstairs Jack me--off
I<00:02:35.310> guess<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.489> would<00:02:36.579> be<00:02:36.609> a<00:02:36.670> different<00:02:37.060> way<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
I guess that would be a different way of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.429 
I guess that would be a different way of
putting<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.569> yes<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.849> did<00:02:40.810> happen<00:02:41.049> I'm

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
putting it yes if that did happen I'm

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.800 
putting it yes if that did happen I'm
sorry<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.370> did<00:02:42.760> happen<00:02:42.939> it's<00:02:43.389> sexual

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
sorry if that did happen it's sexual

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.349 
sorry if that did happen it's sexual
harassment<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.349> all<00:02:44.650> counts<00:02:44.889> no<00:02:45.609> no<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.909> know<00:02:45.969> it

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
harassment on all counts no no I know it

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.039 
harassment on all counts no no I know it
is<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.749> so<00:02:46.870> my<00:02:47.409> argument<00:02:47.489> time<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.700> man<00:02:48.939> up

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
is and so my argument time to man up

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.330 
is and so my argument time to man up
maybe<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.260> makes<00:02:50.469> no<00:02:50.680> difference<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:51.189> this

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
maybe it makes no difference in this

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.330 
maybe it makes no difference in this
case<00:02:51.549> no<00:02:51.939> no<00:02:52.239> my<00:02:52.659> argument<00:02:53.169> I<00:02:53.290> know<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.889> weak

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
case no no my argument I know is weak

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490 
case no no my argument I know is weak
because<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:55.120> course<00:02:55.449> is<00:02:55.599> sexual<00:02:55.959> harassment
