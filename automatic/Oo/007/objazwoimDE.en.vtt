00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
part isn't down quite good so what we do

00:03:42.900 --> 00:04:04.000 
part isn't down quite good so what we do
is<00:03:43.250> put<00:03:44.250> some<00:03:44.400> more<00:03:44.610> glue<00:03:44.910> there

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.309 

there<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.819> if<00:04:04.939> the<00:04:05.120> if<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.750> cloth<00:04:05.959> is<00:04:06.140> close

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.319 
there and if the if the cloth is close
enough<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.709> your<00:04:06.890> scalp<00:04:07.670> color<00:04:07.970> then<00:04:08.299> you

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
enough to your scalp color then you

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.600 
enough to your scalp color then you
don't<00:04:08.720> have<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.019> worry<00:04:09.200> about<00:04:09.379> you<00:04:10.159> know<00:04:10.280> using

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
don't have to worry about you know using

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.179 
don't have to worry about you know using
your<00:04:10.819> concealer<00:04:11.480> foundation<00:04:12.200> or<00:04:12.560> anything

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
your concealer foundation or anything

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.280 
your concealer foundation or anything
like<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.939> just<00:04:14.000> put<00:04:14.480> some<00:04:14.510> down<00:04:14.930> because

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
like that I just put some down because

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.659 
like that I just put some down because
it<00:04:15.409> makes<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.680> look<00:04:15.860> good<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.070> if<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.519> little

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
it makes it look good and if a little

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.170 
it makes it look good and if a little
bit<00:04:16.910> gets<00:04:17.799> here<00:04:18.799> then<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.609> makes<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.850> look<00:04:20.000> even

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
bit gets here then it makes it look even

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.830 
bit gets here then it makes it look even
more<00:04:20.359> natural<00:04:22.120> because<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.240> don't<00:04:23.389> see<00:04:23.600> it

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
more natural because you don't see it

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.990 
more natural because you don't see it
kind<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.199> gets<00:04:24.380> on<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.889> where<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.550> part<00:04:25.850> is

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
kind of gets on the where this part is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.830 
kind of gets on the where this part is
here<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:27.470> can<00:04:27.620> see<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:32.270> then<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.479> have<00:04:32.660> my

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
here you can see that and then I have my

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.770 
here you can see that and then I have my
closure<00:04:33.229> which<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.550> closure<00:04:34.760> I'm<00:04:35.330> just<00:04:35.630> going

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
closure which the closure I'm just going

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.230 
closure which the closure I'm just going
to<00:04:35.810> hot<00:04:36.020> glue<00:04:36.199> on<00:04:36.440> there<00:04:36.650> also<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:38.120> will

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
to hot glue on there also and it will

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.920 
to hot glue on there also and it will
all<00:04:38.389> come<00:04:38.419> together<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.199> need<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.530> flat<00:04:40.280> iron<00:04:40.490> it

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.370 
all come together I need to flat iron it
first<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.169> it<00:04:42.320> will<00:04:42.440> be<00:04:42.530> really<00:04:43.070> flat<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:45.110> I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
first so it will be really flat and I

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.830 
first so it will be really flat and I
just<00:04:45.590> did<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.330> closures<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.539> know<00:04:47.690> the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
just did the closures you know the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.029 
just did the closures you know the
regular<00:04:48.169> old<00:04:48.289> way<00:04:48.760> take<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.789> strip<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.330> hair<00:04:51.289> put

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
regular old way take a strip of hair put

regular old way take a strip of hair put
the<00:04:52.130> glue<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.490> track<00:04:52.729> roll<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.150> up<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.310> you

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
the glue on the track roll it up and you

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.070 
the glue on the track roll it up and you
know<00:04:55.400> find<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.789> middle<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.330> separate<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.930> and

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
know find the middle and separate it and

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.100 
know find the middle and separate it and
then<00:04:57.199> you<00:04:57.770> flat<00:04:58.039> iron<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.510> on<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.539> flat<00:04:59.780> iron<00:04:59.930> in

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.219 
then you flat iron it on a flat iron in
and<00:05:00.260> put<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.039> this<00:05:01.789> is<00:05:02.060> what<00:05:02.930> we<00:05:03.050> have

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
and put it on and this is what we have

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.980 
and put it on and this is what we have
and<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:04.460> should<00:05:04.729> not<00:05:04.760> come<00:05:05.600> up<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.870> mean
