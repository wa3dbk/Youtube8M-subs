00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
tree to be dispatched this is what we

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439 
tree to be dispatched this is what we
have<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.430> your<00:00:17.550> tree<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.029> your<00:00:18.180> door

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
have to do to get your tree to your door

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.450 
have to do to get your tree to your door
fresh<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.949> come<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.220> into<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fresh as we can we come out into the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
fresh as we can we come out into the
field<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.570> height<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
field and look for the right height of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.990 
field and look for the right height of
tree<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:22.980> dictated<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.640> these<00:00:23.760> color

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
tree which is dictated with these color

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:45.029 
tree which is dictated with these color
tags<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.600> Engram<00:00:25.050> comes<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.619> cuts<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> tree

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.869 

and<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.190> Christmas<00:00:46.519> trees<00:00:46.729> loaded<00:00:47.030> up<00:00:48.879> and

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
and the Christmas trees loaded up and

00:00:49.879 --> 00:01:08.890 
and the Christmas trees loaded up and
taken<00:00:50.329> into<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.570> yard<00:00:51.070> pocket

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.210 

so<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> tree<00:01:10.290> arise<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.800> yard<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so when the tree arise on the yard the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.350 
so when the tree arise on the yard the
first<00:01:11.400> thing<00:01:11.550> we<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> check<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
first thing we do is check it for

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
first thing we do is check it for
quality<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.650> sure<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> hasn't<00:01:14.310> been

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
quality to make sure that it hasn't been

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.360 
quality to make sure that it hasn't been
damaged<00:01:14.820> during<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.510> harvesting<00:01:15.990> process

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
damaged during the harvesting process

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.370 
damaged during the harvesting process
the<00:01:17.370> next<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> let's<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.230> tree

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the next thing we do let's put the tree

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
the next thing we do let's put the tree
through<00:01:19.620> this<00:01:19.740> funnel<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:39.180> enter<00:01:39.390> this

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
through this funnel and enter this

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.130 
through this funnel and enter this
netting

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
netting

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.190 
netting
this<00:01:40.680> gives<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.240> g-20<00:01:42.240> protection<00:01:42.810> when<00:01:43.080> it's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this gives the g-20 protection when it's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600 
this gives the g-20 protection when it's
been<00:01:43.350> transported<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
been transported to you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.650 
been transported to you
and<00:01:45.479> finally<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:49.470> measure<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> tree<00:01:50.660> against

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
and finally we measure the tree against

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.840 
and finally we measure the tree against
this<00:01:51.810> measuring<00:01:52.170> pool<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.310> she's<00:01:53.460> done<00:01:53.580> from

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this measuring pool but she's done from

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.760 
this measuring pool but she's done from
the<00:01:54.000> ground<00:01:54.030> right<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.350> top<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the ground right to the very top of the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.140 
the ground right to the very top of the
tree<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.160> that's<00:01:56.310> how<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.640> knew<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:56.940> high

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
tree and that's how we knew how high

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.600 
tree and that's how we knew how high
over<00:01:57.270> two<00:01:57.420> years<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.080> one's<00:01:58.350> 175<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.460> two

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
over two years and this one's 175 to two

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.180 
over two years and this one's 175 to two
meters<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:01.080> ready<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.440> labeled<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
meters and is ready to be labeled and

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.550 
meters and is ready to be labeled and
packaged<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.880> sent<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.300> your<00:02:03.720> door

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.619
