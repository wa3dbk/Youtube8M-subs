eat our dried yeast that we have has
risen<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.140> activated<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.340> we're<00:01:08.520> gonna<00:01:08.610> add<00:01:08.910> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
risen is activated so we're gonna add it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.470 
risen is activated so we're gonna add it
to<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.840> mixture<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.160> dough<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.610> pour<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
to our mixture of our dough here pour it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.980 
to our mixture of our dough here pour it
into<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> bowl<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.530> mix<00:01:13.770> together<00:01:20.990> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
into the bowl and then mix together you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
into the bowl and then mix together you
also<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.470> knead<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> dough<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.010> about

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
also want to knead the dough for about

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.190 
also want to knead the dough for about
10<00:01:23.700> minutes

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.679 

technique<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.369> pushing<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:27.820> way<00:01:28.030> push<00:01:28.509> this

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
technique so pushing this way push this

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.440 
technique so pushing this way push this
way<00:01:28.930> fold<00:01:29.650> it<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.100> push<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:30.790> way<00:01:31.030> push

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
way fold it in to push this way push

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.810 
way fold it in to push this way push
that<00:01:31.600> way<00:01:31.840> hold<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.470> over<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.220> this<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.520> kind<00:01:33.729> of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
that way hold it over so this is kind of

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.780 
that way hold it over so this is kind of
your<00:01:33.939> basic<00:01:34.330> kneading<00:01:35.320> technique<00:01:35.790> continue

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
your basic kneading technique continue

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.429 
your basic kneading technique continue
to<00:01:36.880> work<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.240> flour<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.320> in

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
to work the flour in that you have in

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.420 
to work the flour in that you have in
your<00:01:38.560> work<00:01:38.740> surface<00:01:39.189> area<00:01:41.310> sometimes<00:01:42.310> this

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
your work surface area sometimes this

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.899 
your work surface area sometimes this
would<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> good<00:01:42.909> stress<00:01:43.210> reliever<00:01:44.759> shape<00:01:45.759> it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
would be a good stress reliever shape it

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.520 
would be a good stress reliever shape it
into<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.149> ball<00:01:46.210> what<00:01:47.049> you're<00:01:47.200> doing<00:01:47.409> this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
into a ball what you're doing this

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.149 
into a ball what you're doing this
technique<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:48.070> get<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.399> side<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.799> as<00:01:51.130> you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
technique is get on the side and as you

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.279 
technique is get on the side and as you
spin<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:52.180> kind<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.450> tuck<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.810> bottom<00:01:52.960> up

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
spin it just kind of tuck the bottom up

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.190 
spin it just kind of tuck the bottom up
on<00:01:53.439> put<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.310> little<00:01:54.460> bit<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.640> olive<00:01:54.909> oil<00:01:55.210> put<00:01:56.140> a
