hockey skate it's the top of the Flex
light<00:00:13.549> line<00:00:13.789> offer<00:00:14.090> some<00:00:14.629> great<00:00:14.900> high-end

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
light line offer some great high-end

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.050 
light line offer some great high-end
performance<00:00:15.860> while<00:00:16.309> still<00:00:16.580> offering<00:00:16.760> that

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
performance while still offering that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.210 
performance while still offering that
same<00:00:17.480> fit<00:00:17.900> as<00:00:18.080> you<00:00:18.470> might<00:00:18.590> remember<00:00:18.770> from<00:00:18.949> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
same fit as you might remember from the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.850 
same fit as you might remember from the
Nike<00:00:19.580> skates<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.630> taking<00:00:21.290> it<00:00:21.380> down<00:00:21.530> take<00:00:21.830> a

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
Nike skates so taking it down take a

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.930 
Nike skates so taking it down take a
look<00:00:22.070> at<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:22.310> runner<00:00:22.490> on<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:22.790> they're<00:00:22.910> using

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
look at the runner on it they're using

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.270 
look at the runner on it they're using
the<00:00:23.300> LS<00:00:23.690> 2<00:00:23.960> runner<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:24.530> that's<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.830> high-grade

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
the LS 2 runner so that's the high-grade

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.190 
the LS 2 runner so that's the high-grade
steel<00:00:25.580> from<00:00:25.880> Bauer<00:00:26.060> as<00:00:26.360> well<00:00:26.990> as<00:00:27.080> the

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
steel from Bauer as well as the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.620 
steel from Bauer as well as the
Lightspeed<00:00:27.650> -<00:00:28.100> holder<00:00:29.000> on<00:00:29.120> it<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:29.540> gonna

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
Lightspeed - holder on it so it's gonna

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.690 
Lightspeed - holder on it so it's gonna
be<00:00:29.780> ideal<00:00:30.080> height<00:00:30.350> off<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.590> ice<00:00:30.860> giving<00:00:31.640> you

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
be ideal height off the ice giving you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.180 
be ideal height off the ice giving you
those<00:00:31.760> nice<00:00:32.000> sharp<00:00:32.270> turns<00:00:32.710> going<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.070> the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
those nice sharp turns going on to the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.489 
those nice sharp turns going on to the
quarter<00:00:34.520> package<00:00:34.700> on<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:35.110> they're<00:00:36.110> using<00:00:36.350> what

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.499 
quarter package on it they're using what

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:38.709 
quarter package on it they're using what
they're<00:00:36.589> calling<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:36.980> flex<00:00:37.280> posit<00:00:37.879> hence<00:00:38.539> the

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
they're calling a flex posit hence the

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.540 
they're calling a flex posit hence the
Flex<00:00:38.989> light<00:00:39.230> name<00:00:39.469> as<00:00:39.679> well<00:00:39.859> as<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.129> dimples

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
Flex light name as well as the dimples

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.579 
Flex light name as well as the dimples
in<00:00:40.699> here<00:00:40.940> now<00:00:41.719> what<00:00:41.899> they're<00:00:42.050> doing<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.350> is

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
in here now what they're doing this is

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.520 
in here now what they're doing this is
this<00:00:42.769> is<00:00:42.920> actually<00:00:43.159> a<00:00:43.789> dynamic<00:00:44.719> energy<00:00:45.199> return

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
this is actually a dynamic energy return

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.069 
this is actually a dynamic energy return
which<00:00:46.309> offers<00:00:46.789> a<00:00:47.149> great<00:00:47.600> return<00:00:47.839> of<00:00:47.960> energy

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
which offers a great return of energy

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.169 
which offers a great return of energy
they've<00:00:48.499> used<00:00:48.739> materials<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.729> here<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.059> have

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
they've used materials in here that have

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.389 
they've used materials in here that have
elastic<00:00:50.749> properties<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:51.829> really<00:00:52.010> allows

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
elastic properties so it really allows

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.700 
elastic properties so it really allows
you<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.609> get<00:00:52.789> back<00:00:53.089> on<00:00:53.359> each<00:00:53.510> stride<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.350> as

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
you to get back on each stride and as

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.869 
you to get back on each stride and as
you<00:00:54.859> can<00:00:54.979> see<00:00:55.159> it<00:00:55.280> really<00:00:55.460> does<00:00:55.639> have<00:00:55.850> a

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
you can see it really does have a

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.000 
you can see it really does have a
similar<00:00:56.389> look<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.749> some<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.109> those<00:00:57.199> older<00:00:57.620> Nike

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
similar look to some of those older Nike

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.700 
similar look to some of those older Nike
