drove six hours just to test this new

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.470 
drove six hours just to test this new
boat<00:00:15.490> could<00:00:15.760> because<00:00:16.030> we<00:00:16.150> were<00:00:16.209> so<00:00:16.360> excited

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
boat could because we were so excited

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.740 
boat could because we were so excited
about<00:00:16.840> it<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:18.190> new<00:00:18.490> predator<00:00:18.820> XL<00:00:19.180> is<00:00:19.480> very

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
about it the new predator XL is very

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.470 
about it the new predator XL is very
similar<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.110> the<00:00:20.350> 13<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.880> only<00:00:22.060> differences

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
similar to the 13 the only differences

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.040 
similar to the 13 the only differences
are<00:00:22.540> obviously<00:00:23.260> big<00:00:24.250> motor<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:25.360> hull<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:25.810> also

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
are obviously big motor the hull is also

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.380 
are obviously big motor the hull is also
a<00:00:26.080> little<00:00:26.320> different<00:00:26.500> in<00:00:26.830> that<00:00:26.860> it's<00:00:27.250> about<00:00:28.240> an

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
a little different in that it's about an

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.710 
a little different in that it's about an
inch<00:00:28.570> bigger<00:00:29.520> everywhere<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.030> it's<00:00:31.510> like<00:00:31.600> an

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
inch bigger everywhere so it's like an

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.299 
inch bigger everywhere so it's like an
inch<00:00:31.870> longer<00:00:32.110> an<00:00:32.439> inch<00:00:32.590> wider<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:33.190> it's

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
inch longer an inch wider and it's

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.389 
inch longer an inch wider and it's
taller<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:35.170> cockpit<00:00:35.620> is<00:00:35.710> an<00:00:35.829> inch<00:00:36.010> deeper

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
taller the cockpit is an inch deeper

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.590 
taller the cockpit is an inch deeper
it's<00:00:37.210> just<00:00:37.420> it's<00:00:37.660> just<00:00:37.949> bigger<00:00:38.949> boat<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:40.480> of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
it's just it's just bigger boat think of

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.489 
it's just it's just bigger boat think of
it<00:00:40.719> as<00:00:40.839> the<00:00:41.019> predator<00:00:41.289> 13<00:00:41.769> on<00:00:42.489> steroids<00:00:43.409> once<00:00:44.409> I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
it as the predator 13 on steroids once I

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:45.989 
it as the predator 13 on steroids once I
got<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:44.769> the<00:00:44.829> water<00:00:44.949> at<00:00:45.190> Old<00:00:45.339> Town<00:00:45.519> Maine<00:00:45.760> I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
got in the water at Old Town Maine I

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.459 
got in the water at Old Town Maine I
started<00:00:46.539> getting<00:00:46.749> comfortable<00:00:47.019> in<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.289> boat

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
started getting comfortable in the boat

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.899 
started getting comfortable in the boat
and<00:00:47.679> I<00:00:47.739> realized<00:00:48.039> that<00:00:48.159> it's<00:00:48.370> pretty<00:00:48.579> similar

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
and I realized that it's pretty similar

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.599 
and I realized that it's pretty similar
to<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.120> 13<00:00:49.449> I<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.890> noticed<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.249> biggest

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
to the 13 I really noticed the biggest

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.360 
to the 13 I really noticed the biggest
difference<00:00:51.940> once<00:00:52.569> I<00:00:52.749> was<00:00:53.019> setting<00:00:53.920> up<00:00:54.039> my<00:00:54.129> rods

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
difference once I was setting up my rods

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.279 
difference once I was setting up my rods
