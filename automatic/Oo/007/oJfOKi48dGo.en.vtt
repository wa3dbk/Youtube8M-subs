00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.299
 the volume of water falling from the sky continues 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.670
 the same but the distribution of rainfall 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.780
 that Brazil is changing public waiting 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.480
 recommended deployment 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 immediate rationing of water in the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.920
 City sao paulo had water until 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.289
 up where we are 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.439
 ie now it's turning a step over 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.539
 making faith every second 100g greater 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 water reservoir of the state 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.410
 I thought we are farmers already suffer 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.410
 with the scarcity of water 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.070
 at chicago 2 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.460
 the area we chose to do the 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.739
 The protest is located in a region 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.629
 accumulates various irregularities that 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.629
 takes a day to day forest on the ground 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.350
 from deforestation alerts 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.170
 we verified that there was occurrence of 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 several areas being deforested in this 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.220
 region in the south of roraima 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.170
 how they are alerts 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.630
 we monitored these areas 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.340
 and we identified that in fact what was 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 being pointed out in athletes if 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 concretized on the ground 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.119
 the mayor of transit here where I am 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.909
 here o 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.909
 rr the wood that the company operating 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.469
 wood in this particular area has 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.259
 a history of various irregularities 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.569
 it has already been investigated twice by 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.920
 operations of the federal police to 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.270
 identify crimes linked to exploitation 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.270
 illegal timber 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.610
 after some accusations she lost is the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.549
 authorization to continue its 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.770
 work normally but after entering with 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.140
 appeal in court resulted in the release 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.110
 to follow their normal activities 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.110
 and this only encourages impunity generates a 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.819
 feeling that the crime it compensates for 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.319
 results in situations such as this 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.900
 people are watching here so much 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.030
 exploitation of wood in this area and areas 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.030
 large amounts of deforestation being 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.019
 science has been affirming the importance of 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.999
 keep forests standing to generation 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.730
 rain falling on much of the 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:38.939
 country guaranteeing us warm water and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.689
 quality of life has no 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.879
 Water 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.389
 the lack of water begins here 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.389
 deforestation
