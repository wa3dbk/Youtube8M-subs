00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 friends I have something for you and that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 a comparison between htc one on 7 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.840
 htc was doing and the new fresh 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 featured htc evo on 9 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.500
 we just want a short one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.580
 want to do a good comparison 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.279
 has become so in recent years 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 everything has changed or changed 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.010
 may have gotten worse 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 That's exactly what I want you in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.269
 show this video in short we do that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.349
 display and want us first 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.820
 look at the back and you see 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.439
 already when making out for example that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.950
 I did something here at the position 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.600
 the buttons 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.180
 so much for that otherwise we of course 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.969
 The first thing on the material 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.860
 at least the gloss changed what and also 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.989
 makes on the size of m7 to he the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 bigger jump is the display clearly 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 the housing and housing have become larger as well 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 From the m8 to the new we were then again 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.280
 a little less negligible though 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 it's a bit easier to get 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.500
 Everything shines very nicely that is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.809
 not the case here but what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 of course as the only one or as a bigger one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.840
 be the first to notice as the fastest 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.280
 this is the camera 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
 here we have a round module the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.210
 we have a dual camera and the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.670
 we have a square chamber we have 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.570
 we move from alcoa pixel to old 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.420
 pixel with another second module for 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.450
 depth of field and now we are from 4 4 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.729
 megapixel 43 pixels to 20 megapixels 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 rose you have complained to you 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.579
 So that's a good thing 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.470
 development 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.850
 we have a blitz here and have that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.070
 We changed to two places each 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
 three goals with it even with lightning shots 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 the skin looks unrealistic 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 also has changed here on the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.360
 side of the microphone 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.430
 that went to the left and the htc 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.220
 logo that was here with both devices 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.390
 Guide here it was well received 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.189
 the same was the antennae 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.579
 stripes that do not feel fulfilled 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.920
 to let 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.659
 at this the nicely incorporated in us 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.409
 have uni everywhere the housing was off 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.969
 aluminum 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.130
 So one remained true to oneself like that 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.350
 It is said that you have only a little bit of that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.990
 We change the surface structure 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.880
 change forwards 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.860
 before when look at the pages as 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.760
 By the way, there is much more to see 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.830
 but first of all, there is something good with us 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.400
 It helps differences of course displays 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.840
 display has increased 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.160
 accordingly, of course, what 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.250
 accordingly, it is also sharper 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.290
 we have become frames everywhere 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.580
 the black screens are from year to year 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.069
 to become a bit thinner to the year 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.510
 down the frame has become thicker and 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.709
 Then I got thinner again 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.370
 has also changed in any case these are 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.350
 the button's 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.290
 we have buttons here in black 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.220
 and then from the m8 to the m9 we have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.450
 Switched to on screen keys means 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 that in any case one more thing the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.500
 on falls above the displays and 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.610
 below we find each sound 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.440
 speakers have also 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.720
 from generation to generation 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.630
 improved and what has changed 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.069
 which is located the position of the sensors 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.900
 they at the left of the booming sound and here 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.630
 in both generations between 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.250
 Russia and the front camera front 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.660
 Camera the position is always one 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.950
 a bit further to the left and 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.250
 Of course, the technology has also 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.900
 and the technology behind it changes to 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.380
 For example, here is an old pixel 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.070
 camera 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.510
 Here we still had normal cameras 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.540
 that single thing really makes sense 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.700
 do it for self it's one i say 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.630
 sometimes loleit perform other more potent ones 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.370
 Camera really makes sense 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.900
 I forgot something no that was that 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.910
 front and now we'll do the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.480
 This is going on here 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.819
 top 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.980
 this is on the top and here 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.720
 not because of the one on the 9th 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.359
 it is indeed on the right side 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.040
 slipped extremely important decision 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.040
 extremely correct and extremely good 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.239
 decision apropos right side here 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.519
 Maybe that's not the way it is 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.950
 Well, but I say that you are housed 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.350
 is here more angular here and here 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.209
 again a bit angular always means 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.680
 a bit more handy that is too 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.680
 Another important step you take with you 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.480
 the new one did otherwise falls 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.859
 of course much more on the keys 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.470
 we only have a loudspeaker here 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.450
 still almost in the housing so sat down 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.120
 not so good at fulfilling this and then at 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.250
 makes I had an outstanding, according to the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.109
 Flu and a first hole that must 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.789
 for the sim card 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.099
 but if it does not nail me there 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.289
 on it fixed the further slot at the m9 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.639
 either sim card or sd card the 30th 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.219
 just like the eight did not exactly 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.169
 some title means volume rocker means 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.550
 we are pressing with two volume and yes 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.569
 that of a power button is on the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.460
 right side slipped 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.050
 on the top has also a lot 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.509
 we have changed here now 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.090
 Infrared sensor on the m8 and the m9 at 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.219
 m7 was not there yet but at one 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.280
 7 gave you the 35 mm jack connection 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:48.439
 and the one out of power button there was 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.479
 synonymous with the m8 above the new as I said 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.460
 then only the transmitter can be found 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.650
 we wrap on the left side and 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.110
 find there just the slots for 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.639
 either sd card or sim card like 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.120
 I'm not sure 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.879
 and on the bottom everywhere the micro 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.259
 USB connection but at an 8 and 9 is 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.430
 here still the 3.5 millimeters 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.080
 jack plug and what we see here 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.659
 that is still a small microphone at 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.189
 m8 yeah, you see, it's in the 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.449
 a lot has been done in the past few years 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.139
 was developed if you were 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.180
 I ask myself to evolve intelligently 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.849
 as well as that is good 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.349
 otherwise I would like to do this 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.250
 end video that was my comparison 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:32.060
 between no not between the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.319
 generations is htc hd7 htc wehrmacht 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.349
 and hartz iv 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.349
 thank you for your time is good
