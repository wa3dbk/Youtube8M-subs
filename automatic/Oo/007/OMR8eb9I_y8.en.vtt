defeat this robot as I need to protect

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.400 
defeat this robot as I need to protect
those<00:02:29.890> choppers<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.959> when<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.230> chopper

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
those choppers so when the chopper

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.550 
those choppers so when the chopper
crosses<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.190> front<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.580> shoot<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:35.290> he's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
crosses in front I shoot and now he's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.960 
crosses in front I shoot and now he's
going<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.800> show<00:02:35.980> me<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.220> weak<00:02:36.370> spot<00:02:36.640> there<00:02:36.850> you

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
going to show me the weak spot there you

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.250 
going to show me the weak spot there you
go<00:02:38.220> nice<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.270> so<00:02:41.080> as<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.380> see<00:02:42.180> oops<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
go nice and so as you can see oops the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.630 
go nice and so as you can see oops the
integration<00:02:44.709> with<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> real<00:02:45.100> world<00:02:45.400> is

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
integration with the real world is

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.229 
integration with the real world is
perfect<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:48.070> now<00:02:48.489> kids<00:02:48.850> can<00:02:48.970> go

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
perfect so that really now kids can go

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.000 
perfect so that really now kids can go
to<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.510> beach<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:50.170> go<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.560> playground

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
to the beach can go to the playground

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.770 
to the beach can go to the playground
and<00:02:51.130> school<00:02:51.520> they<00:02:52.030> can<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.209> anywhere<00:02:52.480> they

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
and school they can go anywhere they

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.620 
and school they can go anywhere they
want<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.290> find<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.100> decimals<00:02:54.489> there<00:02:54.730> it's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
want and find in decimals there it's

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.870 
want and find in decimals there it's
also<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.290> smooth<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.280> guess<00:02:57.700> it's

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
also really really smooth I guess it's

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.120 
also really really smooth I guess it's
also<00:02:58.120> 60<00:02:58.930> frames<00:02:59.200> per<00:02:59.260> second<00:02:59.739> for<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.920> first

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
also 60 frames per second for the first

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.370 
also 60 frames per second for the first
time<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.549> franchise<00:03:00.970> yeah<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.570> mean<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.019> KDF

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
time for franchise yeah I mean the KDF

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.289 
time for franchise yeah I mean the KDF
for<00:03:02.620> us<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:02.980> basically<00:03:03.370> when<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:04.060> moved

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
for us is that basically when we moved

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.949 
for us is that basically when we moved
from<00:03:04.510> PSP<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.709> PS<00:03:05.950> Vita<00:03:06.160> we<00:03:06.790> had<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.180> huge

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
from PSP to PS Vita we had a huge

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.470 
from PSP to PS Vita we had a huge
technological<00:03:08.590> leap<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.790> terms<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.239> power

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
technological leap in terms of power

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.110 
technological leap in terms of power
which<00:03:11.140> allow<00:03:11.380> us<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.769> create<00:03:12.220> really<00:03:12.820> amazing

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
which allow us to create really amazing

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.670 
which allow us to create really amazing
experience<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.720> no<00:03:13.989> one<00:03:14.110> has<00:03:14.260> ever<00:03:14.440> seen

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
experience that no one has ever seen

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.310 
experience that no one has ever seen
before<00:03:14.739> for<00:03:15.670> example<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.600> can<00:03:16.750> go<00:03:17.080> here<00:03:17.260> to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
before for example we can go here to

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.259 
before for example we can go here to
this<00:03:17.560> table<00:03:17.860> then<00:03:18.519> again<00:03:18.730> for<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.970> normal

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
this table then again for a normal

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.259 
this table then again for a normal
person<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:19.959> just<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.350> table<00:03:20.769> right<00:03:21.269> but

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
person this is just a table right but

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.910 
person this is just a table right but
again<00:03:22.360> we<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:22.840> better<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:23.620> know<00:03:23.739> that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
again we know better and we know that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.550 
again we know better and we know that
actually<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.940> table<00:03:25.330> something<00:03:26.080> amazing

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
actually in this table something amazing

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.259 
actually in this table something amazing
is<00:03:26.650> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.890> happen<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.340> go<00:03:27.970> here<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.360> battle<00:03:28.660> I

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.630 
so that the Invisibles are going to
fight<00:04:09.760> here<00:04:10.800> it's<00:04:11.800> easy<00:04:11.980> as<00:04:12.130> one-two-three<00:04:12.610> I

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
fight here it's easy as one-two-three I

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.680 
fight here it's easy as one-two-three I
mean<00:04:12.820> it's<00:04:12.940> just<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.180> matter<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:13.420> selecting

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
mean it's just a matter of selecting

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.190 
mean it's just a matter of selecting
surfaces<00:04:14.410> which<00:04:14.860> have<00:04:14.890> some<00:04:15.480> detail<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:16.660> that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
surfaces which have some detail so that

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.870 
surfaces which have some detail so that
the<00:04:17.620> game<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.890> going<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.190> lock<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.610> to<00:04:18.730> the

the game is going to lock on to the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.270 
the game is going to lock on to the
surface<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.480> basically<00:04:20.140> generate<00:04:20.920> gameplay

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
surface and basically generate gameplay

ps3 can get together in the home of one
of<00:05:23.410> them<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:23.770> maybe<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.550> kid<00:05:24.970> on<00:05:25.060> ps3<00:05:25.300> is

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
of them and maybe the kid on ps3 is

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.210 
of them and maybe the kid on ps3 is
going<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.750> be<00:05:25.840> seeing<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.200> action<00:05:26.470> in<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.740> big

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
going to be seeing the action in a big

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.460 
going to be seeing the action in a big
screen<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.390> guy<00:05:28.750> on<00:05:28.900> Vita<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.230> going<00:05:29.380> to

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
screen and the guy on Vita is going to

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.830 
screen and the guy on Vita is going to
be<00:05:29.560> seeing<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.070> augmented<00:05:30.250> reality<00:05:30.660> on<00:05:31.660> the

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
be seeing it in augmented reality on the

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.750 
be seeing it in augmented reality on the
floor<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:32.770> we<00:05:32.800> believe<00:05:33.190> that<00:05:33.340> this<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:33.610> going

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
floor so we believe that this is going

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.190 
floor so we believe that this is going
to<00:05:33.880> generate<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.210> much<00:05:34.540> more<00:05:34.780> social

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
to generate a much more social

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.020 
to generate a much more social
experience<00:05:35.290> in<00:05:36.130> which<00:05:36.280> kids<00:05:36.610> can<00:05:36.700> get

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
experience in which kids can get

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.880 
experience in which kids can get
together<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.540> play<00:05:37.750> together<00:05:37.810> play<00:05:38.530> favorite

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
together and play together play favorite

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.950 
together and play together play favorite
game<00:05:39.040> which<00:05:39.190> is<00:05:39.310> invisible<00:05:39.520> can<00:05:40.450> you<00:05:40.570> launch
