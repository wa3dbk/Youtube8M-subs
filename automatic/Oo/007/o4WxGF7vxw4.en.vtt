sophisticated way

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
sophisticated way
so<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> decided<00:00:32.219> maybe<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.640> should<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> program

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
so I decided maybe I should do a program

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.209 
so I decided maybe I should do a program
in<00:00:33.899> France<00:00:34.200> where<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> visitors<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:37.129> give<00:00:38.129> me

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
in France where the visitors to give me

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.780 
in France where the visitors to give me
no<00:00:38.340> plans<00:00:38.550> ladles<00:00:38.969> exit<00:00:39.329> ah<00:00:39.480> come<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.640> well<00:00:41.640> I'm

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
no plans ladles exit ah come on well I'm

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.510 
no plans ladles exit ah come on well I'm
from<00:00:42.090> Canada<00:00:42.780> Toronto<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
from Canada Toronto I think one of the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.209 
from Canada Toronto I think one of the
very<00:00:44.730> compelling<00:00:45.629> factors<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.530> made<00:00:47.039> me

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
very compelling factors which made me

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.580 
very compelling factors which made me
lean<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.820> towards<00:00:48.180> pehangi<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.200> starch

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
lean more towards pehangi was the starch

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
lean more towards pehangi was the starch
that's<00:00:49.980> incorporated<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.789> program<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that's incorporated with the program I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
that's incorporated with the program I
saw<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> starch<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> great<00:00:52.739> opportunity<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
saw the starch as a great opportunity to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.459 
saw the starch as a great opportunity to
work<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.969> some<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> best<00:00:54.870> chefs<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.379> the
