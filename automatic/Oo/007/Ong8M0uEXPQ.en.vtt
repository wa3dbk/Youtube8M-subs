00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.869 

yeah<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.799> definitely<00:02:23.950> try<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.519> hold<00:02:24.670> back

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879

some<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.239> your<00:02:25.450> emotion<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
some of your emotion because and you

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.640 
some of your emotion because and you
can't<00:02:28.720> start<00:02:29.909> kicking<00:02:30.909> out<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.650> punching

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
can't start kicking out and punching

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.050 
can't start kicking out and punching
people<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.069> bits<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.430> pieces<00:02:33.519> are<00:02:33.879> less

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
people and bits and pieces are less

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.430

you'd<00:02:34.299> have<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.599> try<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.900> hold<00:02:35.019> back<00:02:35.260> but

you'd have to try and hold back but
again<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:36.040> think<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:36.760> down<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.930> your<00:02:38.230> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
again I think that's down to to your to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.860 
again I think that's down to to your to
your<00:02:39.159> captain<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.940> sort<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.209> bring<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.629> team

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
your captain to sort of bring the team

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.039 
your captain to sort of bring the team
in<00:02:40.900> together<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.909> tell<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.269> calm<00:02:43.780> people

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
down and just get the focus on to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.199 
down and just get the focus on to
someone<00:02:47.079> else<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.379> know<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:48.459> the

someone else you know so I think the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.119
