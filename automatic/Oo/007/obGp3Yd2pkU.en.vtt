00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.820
 Pineapple bile pour and give them a new 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.679
 turn to the fresh waters with a bar 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 Self-service water is sometimes very 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.450
 inspired when we 're finished let's go 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.119
 to start with our pineapple bliss 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.400
 pour the key to a rich flavor of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.310
 this recipe are two ingredients well 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 special a piña colada needs 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.800
 exotic texture so use the cream 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 for all-natural coffee 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.530
 coffee ménage vanilla flavor oak 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 to give the laundry the perfect flavor 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 to pineapple use the frozen popsicles outside 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.079
 because they are made with pineapple and juice 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.989
 real pineapple you'll need a cup and a half 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.460
 of frozen pineapple pieces three 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.120
 ice pops 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 sainz pineapple leaves wilted single 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.640
 enough to remove the little stick 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 add a cold house of milk 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.149
 low fat coconut a cup of natural 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 of vanilla flavor and two and a half cups of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 minced ice 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.090
 Blend it until it's smooth and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.090
 then you are ready to serve it 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.579
 How delicious is the second drink for 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.009
 parties will keep your guests 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.960
 hydrated on the hottest days with 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.929
 some fresh fruits and a little bit of 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 imagination you and your guests can 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.780
 make a very tasty water infusion 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.960
 all you need to do is place 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.399
 on the bar two refrigerated bottles 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.399
 of water 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.259
 I prefer a tourline slip simply 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 choose your fresh fruits and herbs 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 favorite and you're ready to start 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.310
 create some delicious combinations 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.429
 I have pineapple which goes very well with 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 orange raspberries are great 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.049
 alone or with a lemon chin to me 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.910
 love watermelon , lemon and mint 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.480
 always add the fruit to your glass first 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.180
 and crush the already you know up mush to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.160
 drop the taste simply has the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 cold water on top and cock
