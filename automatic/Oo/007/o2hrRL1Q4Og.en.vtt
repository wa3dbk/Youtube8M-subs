00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.900 
the water level all the way to the
bottom<00:01:47.960> if<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.740> needed<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.190> depending<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.790> the

I'm gonna stick them down the back of
the<00:02:21.380> background<00:02:21.890> here<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.690> roots<00:02:23.960> will<00:02:24.230> be

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the background here so the roots will be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.970 
the background here so the roots will be
fully<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.000> sand<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.780> any<00:02:27.200> space<00:02:27.620> that's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
fully in the sand and any space that's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.530 
fully in the sand and any space that's
left<00:02:28.069> over<00:02:28.550> I'm<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.819> fill<00:02:29.090> with<00:02:29.270> sand

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
left over I'm going to fill with sand

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.710 
left over I'm going to fill with sand
and<00:02:29.720> rocks<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.430> turtles<00:02:31.790> can't<00:02:32.060> fall<00:02:32.390> back

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
and rocks so the turtles can't fall back

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
and rocks so the turtles can't fall back
behind<00:02:33.020> there<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.090> one<00:02:35.360> coat<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.530> far

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
behind there but this is one coat so far

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.720 
behind there but this is one coat so far
and<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.570> gonna<00:02:38.720> need<00:02:39.040> probably<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.160> total<00:02:40.610> of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and it's gonna need probably a total of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.890 
and it's gonna need probably a total of
four<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.600> would<00:02:42.530> think<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:44.150> first<00:02:44.420> coat<00:02:44.630> was

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
four I would think the first coat was

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.890 
four I would think the first coat was
actually<00:02:45.380> very<00:02:45.650> heavy<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.150> might<00:02:47.450> only<00:02:47.720> need

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
actually very heavy so I might only need

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.490 
actually very heavy so I might only need
a<00:02:48.050> couple<00:02:48.260> more<00:02:48.680> coats<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.630> like<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.380> play

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
a couple more coats but I like to play

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.330 
a couple more coats but I like to play

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
it on the safe side I've got whatever's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.820 
it on the safe side I've got whatever's
left<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.820> my<00:02:56.000> old<00:02:56.209> can<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.840> dry<00:02:57.080> log<00:02:57.350> sitting

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
left of my old can of dry log sitting

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.390 
left of my old can of dry log sitting
right<00:02:58.010> here<00:02:58.630> here's<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.870> dry<00:03:00.080> lock<00:03:00.400> latex

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
right here here's the dry lock latex

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.380 
right here here's the dry lock latex
bass<00:03:02.950> low<00:03:03.950> odor<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.820> nice

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
bass low odor it's nice

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.960 
bass low odor it's nice
I've<00:03:05.959> got<00:03:06.200> some<00:03:06.350> quick<00:03:06.650> Creek<00:03:07.010> cement

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
I've got some quick Creek cement

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.550 
I've got some quick Creek cement
coloring<00:03:09.010> I've<00:03:10.010> got<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:12.100> buff<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:14.230> black<00:03:15.230> I

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
coloring I've got a buff and black I

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.390 
coloring I've got a buff and black I
believe<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.720> that's<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.530> project<00:03:18.770> for<00:03:19.220> right

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
believe so that's the project for right

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.580 
believe so that's the project for right
now<00:03:19.430> I'm<00:03:20.090> gonna<00:03:20.209> get<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.450> hatchling<00:03:21.260> technic

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
now I'm gonna get the hatchling technic

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.330 
now I'm gonna get the hatchling technic
up<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.070> running<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:23.330> then<00:03:24.670> there's<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.970> 125

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
up and running and then there's the 125

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.479 
up and running and then there's the 125
with<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.520> yearlings<00:03:28.970> in<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:31.040> know<00:03:31.130> they

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
with the yearlings in it you know they

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.820 
with the yearlings in it you know they
keep<00:03:31.700> knocking<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.480> rocks<00:03:32.780> into<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.530> water

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
keep knocking the rocks into the water

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.990 
keep knocking the rocks into the water
so<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.610> might<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:36.340> remove<00:03:37.340> some<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.820> rocks

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
so I might just remove some of the rocks

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.230 
so I might just remove some of the rocks
so<00:03:40.630> they<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.490> better<00:03:42.490> chance<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:43.030> staying

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
so they have a better chance of staying

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.600 
so they have a better chance of staying
up<00:03:43.510> top<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.890> here<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.920> little<00:03:47.920> experiment

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
up top this here is a little experiment

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.060 
up top this here is a little experiment
I<00:03:48.730> don't<00:03:48.940> know<00:03:49.030> how<00:03:49.210> well<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.830> work

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
I don't know how well it's going to work

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.580 
I don't know how well it's going to work
out<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.760> long<00:03:51.790> run<00:03:52.270> but<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:54.250> plan<00:03:54.490> was<00:03:55.590> to

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
out in the long run but the plan was to

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.580 
out in the long run but the plan was to
feed<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.980> turtles<00:03:58.290> outside<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.440> their

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
feed the turtles outside of their

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.590 
feed the turtles outside of their
enclosure<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.340> they<00:04:00.520> don't<00:04:00.700> seem<00:04:01.240> to<00:04:01.420> like

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
enclosure but they don't seem to like

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.060 
enclosure but they don't seem to like
that<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> lot<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:04.020> I've<00:04:05.020> used<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.980> couple

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
that a lot so I've used this a couple

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.680 
that a lot so I've used this a couple
times<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:08.970> basically<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.390> throw<00:04:10.570> the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
times and basically I just throw the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.080 
times and basically I just throw the
turtles<00:04:11.020> in<00:04:11.140> one<00:04:11.320> time<00:04:11.710> and<00:04:11.980> throw<00:04:12.940> their

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
turtles in one time and throw their

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.030 
turtles in one time and throw their
pellets<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:13.570> there<00:04:13.750> with<00:04:13.930> them<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.320> they'll

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
pellets in there with them and they'll

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.099 
pellets in there with them and they'll
eat<00:04:16.170> for<00:04:17.170> a<00:04:17.200> minute<00:04:17.560> or<00:04:17.680> two<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.330> then<00:04:19.330> they

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
eat for a minute or two and then they

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.440 
eat for a minute or two and then they
want<00:04:20.350> out<00:04:20.640> luckily<00:04:21.640> they<00:04:21.940> can<00:04:22.090> climb<00:04:22.390> out

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
want out luckily they can climb out

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.550 
want out luckily they can climb out
themselves<00:04:22.840> if<00:04:23.410> they<00:04:23.560> want<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:26.350> that's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
themselves if they want to so that's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.810 
themselves if they want to so that's
good<00:04:26.770> they<00:04:26.980> don't<00:04:27.160> feel<00:04:27.600> trapped<00:04:28.600> in<00:04:29.230> there<00:04:29.820> so

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
good they don't feel trapped in there so

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.130 
good they don't feel trapped in there so
we'll<00:04:30.940> see<00:04:31.150> how<00:04:31.300> well<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.480> works

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
we'll see how well that works

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.790 
we'll see how well that works
I<00:04:32.200> might<00:04:33.190> make<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.490> couple<00:04:33.900> modifications<00:04:34.900> to

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
I might make a couple modifications to

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.420 
I might make a couple modifications to
this<00:04:35.950> design<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.140> was<00:04:38.320> real<00:04:38.919> cheap<00:04:38.950> is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
this design but this was real cheap is

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.280 
this design but this was real cheap is
like<00:04:39.580> $1<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.390> tub<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.710> dollar<00:04:42.520> for<00:04:42.910> the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
like $1 for the tub and a dollar for the

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.040 
like $1 for the tub and a dollar for the
the<00:04:44.290> tubing<00:04:44.740> around<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.370> outside<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.150> then<00:04:46.960> I

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
the tubing around the outside and then I

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.409 
the tubing around the outside and then I
just<00:04:47.200> bought<00:04:47.710> some<00:04:47.950> window<00:04:48.370> window<00:04:49.060> screen

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
just bought some window window screen

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.150 
just bought some window window screen
repair<00:04:50.460> material<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:53.650> little<00:04:53.830> bit<00:04:53.919> of<00:04:54.010> hot

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
repair material and a little bit of hot

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.490 
repair material and a little bit of hot
glue<00:04:54.190> little<00:04:54.730> bit<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.970> duct<00:04:55.090> tape<00:04:55.120> but<00:04:55.900> it's<00:04:56.410> a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
glue little bit of duct tape but it's a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.659 
glue little bit of duct tape but it's a
project<00:04:57.750> we'll<00:04:58.750> see<00:04:59.010> we'll<00:05:00.010> see<00:05:00.040> what<00:05:00.370> ends<00:05:00.520> up

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
project we'll see we'll see what ends up

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.950 
project we'll see we'll see what ends up
working<00:05:01.800> my<00:05:02.800> water<00:05:03.700> lettuce<00:05:04.180> as<00:05:04.479> you<00:05:04.600> can<00:05:04.750> see

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
working my water lettuce as you can see

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.730 
working my water lettuce as you can see
around<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.229> edges<00:05:05.470> it's<00:05:05.860> getting<00:05:06.130> yellow

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
around the edges it's getting yellow

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.520 
around the edges it's getting yellow
and<00:05:08.100> my<00:05:08.340> Izola<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:10.730> pretty<00:05:11.730> much<00:05:11.910> all<00:05:12.330> died<00:05:13.170> off

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
and my Izola is pretty much all died off

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.370 
and my Izola is pretty much all died off
already<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.630> think<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.110> culprit<00:05:16.680> are<00:05:17.250> my

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
already and I think the culprit are my

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.620 
already and I think the culprit are my
my<00:05:19.380> shitty<00:05:19.940> lights<00:05:20.940> up<00:05:21.390> top<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:23.000> guess<00:05:24.000> live<00:05:24.450> and

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
my shitty lights up top I guess live and

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600 
my shitty lights up top I guess live and
learn<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:24.810> don't<00:05:25.380> think<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:25.740> nearly<00:05:26.460> the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
learn I don't think it's nearly the

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.720 
learn I don't think it's nearly the
right<00:05:26.910> spectrum<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.780> keep<00:05:27.960> them<00:05:28.370> healthy<00:05:29.720> but

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
right spectrum to keep them healthy but

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.720 
right spectrum to keep them healthy but
I<00:05:32.780> don't<00:05:33.780> have<00:05:33.990> any<00:05:34.170> plans<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.860> switch<00:05:35.490> out<00:05:35.700> the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
I don't have any plans to switch out the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.660 
I don't have any plans to switch out the
lighting<00:05:36.150> anytime<00:05:36.900> soon<00:05:37.370> eventually<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.400> might

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
lighting anytime soon eventually I might

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.460 
lighting anytime soon eventually I might
change<00:05:39.120> over<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:39.780> LED<00:05:40.710> lighting<00:05:40.740> but<00:05:42.470> that's

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
change over to LED lighting but that's

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.560 
change over to LED lighting but that's
gonna<00:05:43.620> be<00:05:43.710> a<00:05:43.830> ways<00:05:44.040> off<00:05:44.310> because<00:05:44.700> it's<00:05:45.240> still

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
gonna be a ways off because it's still

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.510 
gonna be a ways off because it's still
relatively<00:05:46.470> new<00:05:46.590> when<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.040> price<00:05:47.280> is

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
relatively new when the price is

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.790 
relatively new when the price is
dropping<00:05:47.720> rapidly<00:05:49.610> this<00:05:50.610> guy<00:05:50.820> over<00:05:51.180> here<00:05:51.800> some

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
dropping rapidly this guy over here some

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.920 
dropping rapidly this guy over here some
of<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:52.950> leaves<00:05:53.190> are<00:05:53.490> turning<00:05:53.820> yellow<00:05:53.940> but<00:05:54.900> I

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
of the leaves are turning yellow but I

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.730 
of the leaves are turning yellow but I
think<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:56.190> might<00:05:56.460> be<00:05:56.520> starting<00:05:56.970> to<00:05:57.530> send<00:05:58.530> off

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
think it might be starting to send off

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.160 
think it might be starting to send off
some<00:05:59.130> some<00:05:59.700> roots<00:06:00.000> I'm<00:06:00.390> not<00:06:00.630> sure<00:06:00.810> we'll<00:06:01.020> see

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
some some roots I'm not sure we'll see

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.990 
some some roots I'm not sure we'll see
in<00:06:01.260> a<00:06:01.320> couple<00:06:01.440> weeks<00:06:01.740> if<00:06:02.160> that's<00:06:02.430> Dead<00:06:02.820> or

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
in a couple weeks if that's Dead or

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.040 
in a couple weeks if that's Dead or
Alive<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:05.960> did<00:06:06.960> reattach<00:06:07.500> my<00:06:09.020> fishing<00:06:10.020> line

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
Alive I did reattach my fishing line

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.500 
Alive I did reattach my fishing line
here<00:06:10.560> just<00:06:10.890> to<00:06:11.040> keep<00:06:11.250> this<00:06:11.490> a<00:06:11.550> little<00:06:12.470> nicer

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
here just to keep this a little nicer

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.080 
here just to keep this a little nicer
I<00:06:14.800> haven't<00:06:15.800> bothered<00:06:15.980> to<00:06:16.250> mess<00:06:16.520> with<00:06:16.670> this<00:06:16.850> one

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
I haven't bothered to mess with this one

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.090 
I haven't bothered to mess with this one
over<00:06:17.330> here<00:06:17.510> because<00:06:17.870> of<00:06:18.020> the<00:06:18.140> plant<00:06:18.770> that's

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
over here because of the plant that's

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.580 
over here because of the plant that's
sitting<00:06:19.430> in<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.670> way<00:06:19.820> but<00:06:20.660> anyways<00:06:21.320> that's

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
sitting in the way but anyways that's

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.730 
sitting in the way but anyways that's
the<00:06:22.070> the<00:06:22.610> situation<00:06:22.820> here<00:06:23.570> I<00:06:23.750> did<00:06:24.350> take<00:06:24.530> all

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
the the situation here I did take all

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.190 
the the situation here I did take all
the<00:06:25.070> driftwood<00:06:26.030> out<00:06:26.300> for<00:06:26.570> now<00:06:26.720> it's<00:06:26.960> just

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
the driftwood out for now it's just

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.280 
the driftwood out for now it's just
sitting<00:06:27.710> over<00:06:27.890> here<00:06:28.570> because<00:06:29.570> I<00:06:29.600> wanted<00:06:30.140> to

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
sitting over here because I wanted to

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.090 
sitting over here because I wanted to
clean<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.980> gravel<00:06:31.580> really<00:06:32.150> well<00:06:32.920> so<00:06:33.920> I'll

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
clean the gravel really well so I'll

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.370 
clean the gravel really well so I'll
take<00:06:34.310> those<00:06:34.520> rocks<00:06:34.850> out<00:06:35.390> of<00:06:35.450> there<00:06:35.870> clean<00:06:36.260> the

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
take those rocks out of there clean the

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.860 
take those rocks out of there clean the
gravel<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.490> then<00:06:38.060> I'll<00:06:38.180> put<00:06:38.330> some<00:06:38.540> driftwood

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
gravel and then I'll put some driftwood

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.340 
gravel and then I'll put some driftwood
back<00:06:39.170> in<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:40.370> hopefully<00:06:40.640> by<00:06:41.060> that<00:06:41.090> point<00:06:41.540> the

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
back in and hopefully by that point the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.850 
back in and hopefully by that point the
55<00:06:43.220> gallon<00:06:43.250> background<00:06:44.210> is<00:06:44.390> in<00:06:44.600> but<00:06:45.500> like<00:06:45.740> I

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
55 gallon background is in but like I

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.260 
55 gallon background is in but like I
said<00:06:46.070> it's<00:06:46.220> gonna<00:06:46.310> take<00:06:46.580> a<00:06:46.610> couple<00:06:46.850> more<00:06:47.090> coats

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
said it's gonna take a couple more coats

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.240 
said it's gonna take a couple more coats
of<00:06:47.480> dry<00:06:47.690> lock<00:06:47.960> then<00:06:48.200> I<00:06:48.230> got<00:06:48.410> a<00:06:48.440> silicone<00:06:48.950> it<00:06:49.130> in

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
of dry lock then I got a silicone it in

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.720 
of dry lock then I got a silicone it in
place<00:06:49.520> and<00:06:50.110> I<00:06:51.110> probably<00:06:51.800> got<00:06:52.010> to<00:06:52.100> make<00:06:52.190> one<00:06:52.220> cut

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
place and I probably got to make one cut

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.680 
place and I probably got to make one cut
on<00:06:53.180> the<00:06:53.780> background<00:06:54.290> to<00:06:54.440> get<00:06:54.560> it<00:06:54.770> in<00:06:55.450> and<00:06:56.450> will

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
on the background to get it in and will

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.660 
on the background to get it in and will
take<00:06:56.840> a<00:06:56.900> couple<00:06:57.410> days<00:06:57.650> like<00:06:58.070> three<00:06:58.340> four<00:06:58.520> days

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
take a couple days like three four days

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.500 
take a couple days like three four days
for<00:06:59.000> the<00:06:59.120> silicone<00:06:59.720> to<00:06:59.900> completely<00:07:00.260> dry<00:07:01.510> and

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
for the silicone to completely dry and

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.440 
for the silicone to completely dry and
back<00:07:02.780> behind<00:07:03.050> the<00:07:03.500> background<00:07:04.340> so<00:07:04.940> it'll

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
back behind the background so it'll

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.970 
back behind the background so it'll
probably<00:07:05.600> be<00:07:05.780> a<00:07:05.810> week<00:07:05.990> or<00:07:06.170> two<00:07:06.290> before<00:07:06.440> this<00:07:06.770> is

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
probably be a week or two before this is

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.290 
probably be a week or two before this is
up<00:07:07.400> and<00:07:07.700> running<00:07:07.970> but<00:07:08.680> that'll<00:07:09.680> be<00:07:09.710> exciting

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.820 

so<00:07:14.300> that's<00:07:14.600> about<00:07:14.720> it<00:07:14.870> for<00:07:15.290> right<00:07:15.440> now

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.010 

I<00:07:18.920> gotta<00:07:19.550> get<00:07:19.760> a<00:07:19.820> bigger<00:07:20.030> basket<00:07:20.330> than<00:07:20.840> that

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
I gotta get a bigger basket than that

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.660 
I gotta get a bigger basket than that
it's<00:07:21.620> not<00:07:21.950> quite<00:07:22.340> deep<00:07:22.580> enough<00:07:22.730> for<00:07:23.530> them<00:07:24.670> but

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
it's not quite deep enough for them but

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.590 
it's not quite deep enough for them but
I<00:07:26.410> don't<00:07:27.410> know<00:07:27.500> maybe<00:07:27.710> I'll<00:07:27.920> use<00:07:28.130> a<00:07:28.450> sink<00:07:29.450> at

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:29.600 
I don't know maybe I'll use a sink at

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.870 
I don't know maybe I'll use a sink at
some<00:07:29.810> point<00:07:32.020> we'll<00:07:33.020> see<00:07:33.520> alright<00:07:34.520> see<00:07:34.820> you

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
some point we'll see alright see you

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.060 
some point we'll see alright see you
guys<00:07:34.940> later
