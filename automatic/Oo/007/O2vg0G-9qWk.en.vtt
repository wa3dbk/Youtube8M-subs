00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.050
 story is the following 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.790

 of order one day your friend raj he will 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.739
 communicates that he has been chosen to carry 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.480
 some gifts to the castle of blue but he 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.180
 wants you to be the one to take them now 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 that you think you 're older and you should 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.649
 see the world which you have never seen 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.829
 and he describes it in wonderful ways 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.899
 the world is huge and precious in 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.949
 special the city of law a place 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.269
 full of life when talking to the villagers 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.339
 discover that the forest surrounding the 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.739
 villa is no longer as safe as before 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.839
 that is now surrounded by monsters and 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.300
 besides the monkeys that already inhabited it 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.829
 Now ask in the villa and that touches 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.329
 pretty noses 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.280
 this is demonstrated when suddenly 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.600
 appear some goblins that leave you 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.180
 unconscious of a club in the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.100
 head and also kidnap children 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.170
 from the villa 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.360
 you come running to his aid in 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.640
 direction to the forest but where before 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.759
 there was this now there is a huge wall 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.619
 black with some very strange drawings of 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.380
 there appears a brother who drags you 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.479
 inside you are in the forest but it is not the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.180
 same forest from before is much more 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.210
 dark and is populated by beings 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.700
 really terrifying suddenly you 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.100
 you transform the balloon you fall unconscious and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.770
 the monsters take you prisoner while 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.930
 you try to escape you know the mirna a 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.929
 kind of sinister looking girl and 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.759
 a pretty grotesque sense of humor 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.830
 she says she can get you out of there and not 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.530
 only that can return your form 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.690
 human, but in return he wants you to look for 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.289
 and give him some magical objects with 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.569
 a great dark power the cast shadow 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.970
 the game came out a year after what 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.090
 it was initially announced that he fucked 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.009
 a lot of fans and me included but that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.810
 decision was made to be able to polish yet 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.209
 more the game and to create a port for 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.040
 the new console the nintendo wii is the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.020
 graphics are something really spectacular 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.570
 for the time you just have to think what 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.120
 and very soon after juli the game of 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.150
 rockstar and also has a lot style 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.340
 darker and more mature than other cell alone 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.040
 must see link is much more adult 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.170
 much more mature than the others and also 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.090
 can be shown by watching the modeling of 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.460
 the landscapes and the characters to 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.650
 Twilight had originally been 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.840
 thought that this was the second part 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.850
 of the legend of zelda wind waker but 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.700
 nintendo of america said that the game does not 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.700
 had been very successful in the USA 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.770
 because of his more childish style that made 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.440
 that the project will be parked to leave it 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.510
 for that attempt and it will start from 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.580
 new to create a more mature style 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.680
 to try to please the new market 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.530
 of players and the truth is that the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.870
 play went very well the gameplay was 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.640
 incredibly fluid especially in 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.740
 wii since in game we obtained the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.800
 classic use of buttons but in wii 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.990
 was the great revolution you moved and 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.020
 the game was moving with you you did not have the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.460
 command and in the sword he fluttered as 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.459
 I saw the boat that covered you with the 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.040
 shield point you go to the screen and you could 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.110
 select the objects and then use them 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.969
 sound is a key factor in the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.040
 videogames and in this is 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.719
 incredibly well accomplished since 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.430
 apart from being very good compound 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.290
 we also have references to others 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.709
 previous games mostly from ocarina 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.109
 of time 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.230
 we have the zanada nana in moments 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.879
 key in sad and happy moments 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.129
 we have the song of sharjah for the 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.620
 confrontation with school kid in the 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.650
 forest and we also have the song of 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.720
 Bona to call her is a great nod to 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.120
 the players of the whole life of the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.739
 cell and also a great joy the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.379
 truth is that twilight princess is my 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.459
 favorite video game not from the zelda saga 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:04.340
 not wii but my favorite video game 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.040
 between all since what you feel at 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.200
 playing it is not something describable I've already 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.319
 played a lot of times what completed 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.510
 one hundred percent and still thrilling me 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.000
 every time the game is something that is not 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.889
 can describe with words 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 you can not describe with words the 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.300
 feeling that when you move 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.340
 lynn move with you can not 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.800
 express in words the fact that at 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.220
 make a revolving attack you can hear by 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.230
 the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.020
 of the wii the sound of the sword 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.020
 shining can not be described with 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.360
 words how exciting are the 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.150
 battles on horseback much more polished than 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.830
 in other games that had already been done 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.230
 you can describe with words what 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.270
 exciting that is the sound and what 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.070
 exciting to hear again the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.720
 songs that once you heard in 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.030
 great video games 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.100
 you can not describe with words what 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.920
 deep what is the story and how do you 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.140
 you put into it the truth is that the wiki 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.760
 this game were something really 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.070
 revolutionary for the history of the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.380
 video games and I told you that's my 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.720
 favorite video game and I thank you 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.610
 would give a 10 but since perfection does not 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.040
 there will give one and a half but I already 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.280
 I say I think this game deserves a 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.780
 10 or even a 15 is one of the best 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.840
 within the history of videogames 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.720
 my favorite video game and one of the most 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.720
 indispensable that every gamer must play 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.470
 yes yes
