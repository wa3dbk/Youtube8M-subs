00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 of November when at this round 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.970
 at the height of this roundabout at the doors 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.890
 of arcole a drama is consummated a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.349
 Incredible accident that cost lives 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.830
 four young boys came 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.139
 overwhelmed by a car driven by a 31 year old 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 drunk an episode that aroused 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.439
 obviously great hype 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.689
 great emotions and that led to 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.410
 collection of signatures for the murder 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 road 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.080
 now almost two months later this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.640
 crime seems increasingly a reality 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.830
 to be proposed by the minister of justice 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 anna maria cancellieri she would like 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.910
 introduce it with a bill if 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.100
 not even a decree already within the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 end of January the establishment of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.030
 this crime is designed with the aim 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.950
 priority to guarantee rapid processes 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 able to recognize a justice 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.149
 faster to victims with relatives 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.430
 compensated in a much shorter time 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 compared to today 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.100
 an inevitable tightening then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.800
 convictions for those responsible 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 of fatal accidents of the new 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 offenses have been talked about for years 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.109
 often presenting also the so-called 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 life imprisonment of the license 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.619
 that is the absolute prohibition of driving in 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.729
 more serious cases 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.950
 already in mid-November the minister 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.900
 the angelino alfano interior had made it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 known that precisely on the crime of murder 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 road had been activated with the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.770
 ministry of transport a group of 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 work to verify its feasibility 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.549
 so the minister chancellors spoke 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.619
 of a social problem that as such goes 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.790
 then addressed by introducing tools 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.680
 dissuasive 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.570
 for those who believe they can be 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 driving while not completely 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.409
 master of himself and therefore in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.659
 disregard for the lives of others 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.310
 between the basic steps in the draft 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 already prepared last year 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 first of all the final revocation of the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.070
 license that could by itself 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 represent the strongest deterrent 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 for those wishing to drive in conditions 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 such as not to guarantee safety 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.530
 the crime of homicide 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.869
 road would be an evolution of that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 culpable with penalties up to 10 years of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.100
 prison in the event of an accident caused 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.799
 for driving while intoxicated or under 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.270
 effect of drugs the third point that the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.159
 Minister of Justice believes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.560
 the development of the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.869
 process that must take place by ritual 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.060
 very direct when the causes 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.250
 of the accident are ascertained with 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.530
 absolute precision 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.360
 so you would skip some 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.370
 procedural delays accelerating i 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.140
 time of economic compensation for i 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 relatives of victims at the level 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.810
 national traffic police in the first 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.490
 10 months of 2013 reported over 18 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.650
 thousand claims for driving in the state of 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.930
 drunkenness on about a million and a half 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.340
 one thousand disputed infringements for whom 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.340
 he drove under the influence of drugs
