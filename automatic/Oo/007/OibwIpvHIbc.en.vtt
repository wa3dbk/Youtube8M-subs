to submerge them for any length of time
through<00:01:03.420> testing<00:01:03.989> i've<00:01:04.170> noticed<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
through testing i've noticed that if you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.050 
through testing i've noticed that if you
leave<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.080> hexamine<00:01:07.080> tablet<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.650> water<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:09.000> will

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
leave a hexamine tablet in water it will

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
leave a hexamine tablet in water it will
start<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> dissolve<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.710> eventually<00:01:11.250> it'll

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
start to dissolve and eventually it'll

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.350 
start to dissolve and eventually it'll
become<00:01:11.750> basically<00:01:12.750> nothing<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:14.729> okay<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
become basically nothing it's okay if it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.649 
become basically nothing it's okay if it
gets<00:01:15.540> wet<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.460> but<00:01:17.630> anything<00:01:18.630> more

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
gets wet a little bit but anything more

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
gets wet a little bit but anything more
than<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.380> start<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.740> damage<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
than that can start to damage the the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.710 
than that can start to damage the the
tablet<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.140> inside<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.799> come<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.729> two

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
tablet so inside you come you get two

tablet so inside you come you get two
sets<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.610> 12<00:01:26.869> like<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.200> now<00:01:29.100> these<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.490> not

but<00:02:02.740> I'm<00:02:02.890> gonna<00:02:03.040> give<00:02:03.310> one<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.640> shot<00:02:03.940> anyways

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.050 

because<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.070> off<00:02:09.190> chance<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.760> it<00:02:09.880> does

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
because in the off chance that it does

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780 
because in the off chance that it does
work<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:11.530> no<00:02:11.680> reason<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.070> waste<00:02:12.340> fuel

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
work there's no reason to waste fuel

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.920 
work there's no reason to waste fuel
right<00:02:15.000> inspecting<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.180> tablet

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
right inspecting the tablet

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.190 
right inspecting the tablet
it<00:02:17.170> looks<00:02:17.350> like<00:02:17.560> kicks<00:02:17.860> mean<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:20.140> it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
it looks like kicks mean actually it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200 
it looks like kicks mean actually it
looks<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.530> little<00:02:20.710> more<00:02:20.980> refined<00:02:21.520> than<00:02:21.730> say<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
looks a little more refined than say the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.080 
looks a little more refined than say the
blue<00:02:22.450> ones<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.230> blue<00:02:23.560> ones<00:02:23.800> are<00:02:23.980> kind<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.520> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.180 

larger<00:02:28.090> granule<00:02:28.720> size<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.500> looks<00:02:29.830> more

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
larger granule size and this looks more

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.170 
larger granule size and this looks more
powdery<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.110> then<00:02:32.110> compacted<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.940> kind<00:02:34.120> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
powdery and then compacted it's kind of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.310 
powdery and then compacted it's kind of
a<00:02:34.240> cool<00:02:34.450> size<00:02:34.720> hopefully<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.710> works<00:02:37.320> alright

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
a cool size hopefully it works alright

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.260 
a cool size hopefully it works alright
and<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.650> way<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.950> gonna<00:02:39.100> do<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.610> I'm<00:02:39.880> going

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and the way I'm gonna do this I'm going

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.560 
and the way I'm gonna do this I'm going
to<00:02:40.570> test<00:02:40.870> my<00:02:41.200> brand<00:02:41.500> new<00:02:42.570> bushcraft

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
to test my brand new bushcraft

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.080 
to test my brand new bushcraft

essentials book push box put the flat
plate<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.430> actually<00:02:48.580> put<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.390> at<00:02:49.630> an

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
plate you can actually put this in at an

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.750 
plate you can actually put this in at an
angle<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.230> put<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.770> about<00:02:54.610> like

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
angle and if you put it in about like

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.930 
angle and if you put it in about like
that<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.050> slide<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.740> back<00:02:56.950> portion<00:02:57.610> in

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that you can slide the back portion in

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.620 
that you can slide the back portion in
and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.750> goes<00:02:59.220> straight<00:03:00.220> down<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
and then it goes straight down and the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.540 
and then it goes straight down and the
other<00:03:01.780> support<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.530> right<00:03:02.800> on<00:03:02.980> top<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.400> there

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
other support is right on top of there

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.840 
other support is right on top of there
so<00:03:04.020> obviously<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.770> was<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> design<00:03:06.490> feature

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
so obviously this was a design feature

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.930 
so obviously this was a design feature
of<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.300> stove<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.250> hopefully<00:03:09.610> it'll<00:03:09.760> work

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
of this stove so hopefully it'll work

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.490 
of this stove so hopefully it'll work
and<00:03:10.090> again<00:03:10.240> we're<00:03:10.600> going<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.900> see<00:03:11.080> if<00:03:11.170> we<00:03:11.200> can

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
and again we're going to see if we can

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.390 
and again we're going to see if we can
get<00:03:11.709> two<00:03:11.920> cups<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.370> water<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.790> boil<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.400> I'm

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
get two cups of water to boil and I'm

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.780 
get two cups of water to boil and I'm
using<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:16.650> stanley<00:03:17.650> mess<00:03:18.489> kit

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
well I've got that pretty well centered

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.140 
well I've got that pretty well centered
let's<00:03:43.920> go<00:03:44.070> ahead<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.370> see<00:03:44.580> if<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:44.820> can<00:03:45.000> get

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
let's go ahead and see if we can get

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.120 
let's go ahead and see if we can get
this<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> boil

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
this to boil

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.470 
this to boil
unfortunately<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.340> end<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.970> first<00:03:48.210> burn

unfortunately the end of the first burn

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.120 
unfortunately the end of the first burn
test<00:03:48.840> ended<00:03:49.680> up<00:03:49.800> corrupted<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.610> as<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.660> recap

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
test ended up corrupted so as a recap

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.620 
test ended up corrupted so as a recap
basically<00:03:53.130> what<00:03:53.280> happened<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.090> fuel

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
quite enough to get it to boil I'm gonna

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.920 
quite enough to get it to boil I'm gonna
do<00:05:13.949> one<00:05:14.190> final<00:05:14.759> test<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.300> then<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:15.569> have<00:05:15.720> my

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
do one final test and then I have my

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.140 
do one final test and then I have my
determination<00:05:16.289> but<00:05:16.919> as<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.490> stands<00:05:17.789> currently

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
determination but as it stands currently

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.040 
determination but as it stands currently
it<00:05:18.569> looks<00:05:18.810> like<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:20.550> may<00:05:21.180> not<00:05:21.330> be<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.539> good<00:05:21.870> way

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
it looks like it may not be a good way

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.850 
it looks like it may not be a good way
to<00:05:22.080> boil<00:05:22.830> water<00:05:23.810> unless<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:24.990> can<00:05:25.139> manage<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.530> get

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
to boil water unless I can manage to get

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.400 
to boil water unless I can manage to get
it<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.130> go<00:05:26.280> with<00:05:26.430> three<00:05:26.789> all<00:05:27.780> right<00:05:27.930> guys<00:05:28.139> this

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
it to go with three all right guys this

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.370 
it to go with three all right guys this
is<00:05:28.470> one<00:05:28.979> last<00:05:29.220> try<00:05:29.900> this<00:05:30.900> time<00:05:31.199> I'm<00:05:31.349> using

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
is one last try this time I'm using

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:50.420 
is one last try this time I'm using
three<00:05:37.190> all<00:05:38.190> three<00:05:38.610> at<00:05:38.699> once

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.240 

right<00:05:51.430> at<00:05:51.639> nine<00:05:52.000> minutes<00:05:52.379> I'm<00:05:53.379> actually<00:05:53.800> at<00:05:54.219> a

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
right at nine minutes I'm actually at a

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.350 
right at nine minutes I'm actually at a
rolling<00:05:54.819> boil<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:56.710> with<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.069> three<00:05:57.849> tabs<00:05:58.120> it

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
rolling boil and with the three tabs it

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.089 
rolling boil and with the three tabs it
looks<00:05:58.539> like<00:05:58.719> it's<00:05:58.930> gonna<00:05:59.080> burn<00:05:59.379> just<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.770> little

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
looks like it's gonna burn just a little

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.929 
looks like it's gonna burn just a little
bit<00:06:00.250> longer<00:06:01.349> at<00:06:02.349> half<00:06:02.590> a<00:06:02.710> minute<00:06:02.919> or<00:06:03.280> nine<00:06:03.789> and

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:03.939 
bit longer at half a minute or nine and

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.390 
bit longer at half a minute or nine and
a<00:06:04.000> half<00:06:04.060> minutes<00:06:04.539> on<00:06:04.659> these<00:06:04.780> three<00:06:05.110> tabs<00:06:05.400> but

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
a half minutes on these three tabs but

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.399 
a half minutes on these three tabs but
we<00:06:06.580> are<00:06:06.729> boiling<00:06:09.210> so<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:10.330> is<00:06:10.479> possible<00:06:10.960> to<00:06:10.990> boil

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
we are boiling so it is possible to boil

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.179 
we are boiling so it is possible to boil
water<00:06:11.590> with<00:06:11.770> these<00:06:12.210> Coghlan<00:06:13.210> fuel<00:06:13.659> tablets

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:14.189 
water with these Coghlan fuel tablets

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.140 
water with these Coghlan fuel tablets

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
you're just not going to be able to do

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.959 
you're just not going to be able to do
it<00:06:16.300> with<00:06:16.919> one<00:06:17.919> tablet<00:06:18.430> I<00:06:18.669> said<00:06:20.400> if<00:06:21.400> you<00:06:21.520> do<00:06:21.639> one

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
it with one tablet I said if you do one

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.610 
it with one tablet I said if you do one
after<00:06:22.180> another<00:06:22.389> you<00:06:22.900> might<00:06:23.110> be<00:06:23.259> able<00:06:23.319> to<00:06:23.439> get

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
after another you might be able to get

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.409 
after another you might be able to get
away<00:06:23.740> with<00:06:24.069> using<00:06:24.279> two<00:06:26.610> you<00:06:27.610> barely<00:06:27.879> get<00:06:28.150> away

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
away with using two you barely get away

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.189 
away with using two you barely get away
with<00:06:28.659> using<00:06:28.900> three<00:06:29.590> at<00:06:29.919> the<00:06:30.159> same<00:06:30.370> time

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
with using three at the same time

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.730 
with using three at the same time
however<00:06:33.599> it<00:06:34.599> does<00:06:34.779> keep<00:06:35.020> the<00:06:35.199> water<00:06:35.379> boiling

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
however it does keep the water boiling

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.629 
however it does keep the water boiling
for<00:06:36.219> a<00:06:36.279> minute<00:06:36.870> as<00:06:37.870> it<00:06:38.740> stands<00:06:39.009> I<00:06:39.219> will<00:06:39.250> not<00:06:39.520> be
