can<00:02:03.399> fix<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.119> hear<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.329> it's<00:02:04.450> higher

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
can fix it you can hear if it's higher

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.630 
can fix it you can hear if it's higher
low<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.020> fix<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.349> but<00:02:05.679> watch<00:02:05.920> your<00:02:06.219> thumb<00:02:06.459> when

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
low and fix it but watch your thumb when

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.699 
low and fix it but watch your thumb when
you<00:02:06.759> play<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.060> octave<00:02:07.390> all<00:02:08.110> right<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.530> good

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
you play the octave all right so a good

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.259 
you play the octave all right so a good
way<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.890> practice<00:02:09.399> your<00:02:09.429> octaves<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.149> do

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
way to practice your octaves you can do

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.630 
way to practice your octaves you can do
with<00:02:10.450> both<00:02:10.630> hands<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.069> make<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.519> way

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
with both hands and I make it in the way

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:31.110 
with both hands and I make it in the way
here<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.299> to<00:02:19.290> try<00:02:20.290> triplets

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.030 

now<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:31.989> those<00:02:32.170> are<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.230> fat<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.680> fast

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
now so those are you know fat like fast

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.830 
now so those are you know fat like fast
octaves<00:02:36.550> or<00:02:36.640> point<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.390> if<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.540> were<00:02:37.690> going

octaves or point that if you were going

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.110 
octaves or point that if you were going
to<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:38.019> legato<00:02:38.470> octaves<00:02:39.010> which<00:02:39.400> are<00:02:39.550> smooth

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
to do legato octaves which are smooth

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.180 
to do legato octaves which are smooth
oxes<00:02:40.690> octaves<00:02:41.200> legato<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.739> means<00:02:41.950> smooth

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
oxes octaves legato just means smooth

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.610 
oxes octaves legato just means smooth
and<00:02:42.400> connected<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:44.050> want<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.319> learn<00:02:44.470> how<00:02:44.590> to

use three four and five when you do

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.610 
use three four and five when you do
octaves<00:02:46.569> if<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.989> reach<00:02:47.230> it

and<00:03:40.810> come<00:03:41.080> down<00:03:41.850> sometimes<00:03:42.850> you<00:03:42.970> have<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> do

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
and come down sometimes you have to do

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.420 
and come down sometimes you have to do
five<00:03:43.540> five<00:03:43.810> now<00:03:44.410> three<00:03:44.740> four<00:03:45.010> five<00:03:45.190> would<00:03:45.400> be

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
five five now three four five would be

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.570 
five five now three four five would be
like<00:03:45.670> if<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:45.940> had<00:03:45.970> AC<00:03:46.950> ABC<00:03:49.440> see<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.680> if<00:03:51.430> you

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
like if you had AC ABC see that if you

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.040 
like if you had AC ABC see that if you
can<00:03:51.760> reach<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.000> some<00:03:52.300> people<00:03:52.540> can't<00:03:52.720> reason

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
can reach it some people can't reason

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.229 
can reach it some people can't reason
that's<00:03:53.260> fine

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
that's fine

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.320 
that's fine
five<00:03:55.239> four<00:03:55.870> three<00:03:55.900> five<00:03:56.800> four<00:03:57.370> three<00:03:57.430> five

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and three more so get that three four

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.030 
and three more so get that three four
five<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.049> do<00:04:16.170> ligado<00:04:16.560> watch<00:04:16.859> it
