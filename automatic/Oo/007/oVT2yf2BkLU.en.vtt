00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.589

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.589
 where who you know 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.869
 there guys good morning spoke with mild to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.689
 class II changed tire in the stork saw 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.460
 tire is different and led to 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.579
 fine now here at the base of the dot 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.680
 lacerda said retention of the document he 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:46.320
 Beauty, I'll change the tires. 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:54.040
 It's in the article about beauty people. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:58.560
 alert for you then the resolution 58 8 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:03.190
 contran counter 558 spoke is the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.280
 resolution is written and to retain my 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.670
 document I'm going to change tires there 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 said people 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.979
 Only your one showed me the right one. 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:27.070
 but hey, I 'm going to change the tire 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.000
 I'll show you the tire there. 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 How is it different? 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.899
 we have here to sell here he has 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.450
 a drawing certainly has here it has 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.880
 other design sure hope you are 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.290
 different from the axis if it is to look at 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.939
 the other side there knows that one of the tires 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.810
 edition 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:13.580
 but then this is no good no more 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 they serve well but this one beats that 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.730
 There nobody here is the same as here. 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.010
 I think this one hits either side and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.930
 This is where you can use it, right? 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:36.540
 so this one is going to beat the same with 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:41.160
 inside and there for me one day as outside 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.470
 No, it's ok, right, okay, then I 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.320
 I'll go there now if you check this out. 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.620
 musician think hopefully the bistek 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.890
 sure but there are also so much between 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.130
 the same items the idea is identical no 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 So I go there and now, over here and there. 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.510
 For me to come here now I want to see
