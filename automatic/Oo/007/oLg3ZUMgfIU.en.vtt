00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
my GoPro they're using a number 10 screw

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.880 
my GoPro they're using a number 10 screw
I<00:01:27.040> had<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.280> cut<00:01:28.520> down<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.830> about<00:01:30.860> half<00:01:31.610> inch<00:01:31.970> but

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
I had to cut down to about half inch but

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.490 
I had to cut down to about half inch but
you<00:01:33.890> might<00:01:34.100> want<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.460> try<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.820> see<00:01:35.320> how<00:01:36.320> much

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you might want to try and see how much

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.140 
you might want to try and see how much
you<00:01:37.370> have<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.670> cut<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.910> use<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:43.150> nylon

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
you have to cut and I use this nylon

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.030 
you have to cut and I use this nylon
instead<00:01:44.900> of<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.080> lock<00:01:45.530> nut<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.680> doesn't

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
instead of a lock nut so that it doesn't

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:04.060 
instead of a lock nut so that it doesn't
come<00:01:49.190> off<00:01:49.250> easily<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:02.030> simply<00:02:03.020> tighten<00:02:03.530> it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
come off easily and simply tighten it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:14.320 
come off easily and simply tighten it
I<00:02:10.390> was<00:02:11.390> cheap<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.080> use<00:02:12.350> brass<00:02:13.030> screws<00:02:14.030> but

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
I was cheap so I use brass screws but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.810 
I was cheap so I use brass screws but
you<00:02:14.420> can<00:02:14.570> use<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> stainless<00:02:15.260> steel<00:02:17.410> they

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
you can use a stainless steel they

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:29.590 
you can use a stainless steel they
should<00:02:19.820> be<00:02:19.970> much<00:02:20.180> stronger

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.690 

okay<00:02:30.600> that's<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:32.069> simple<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
okay that's it it's really simple to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.699 
okay that's it it's really simple to
make<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.630> only<00:02:33.900> thing<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.200> was<00:02:34.380> worried<00:02:34.650> about

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
make the only thing I was worried about

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.890 
make the only thing I was worried about
was<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:36.709> make<00:02:37.709> sure<00:02:38.010> my<00:02:38.610> real<00:02:39.030> line<00:02:39.600> doesn't

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
was to make sure my real line doesn't

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.330 
was to make sure my real line doesn't
get<00:02:40.310> hung<00:02:41.310> tangle<00:02:41.880> around<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.770> camera<00:02:43.770> and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
get hung tangle around the camera and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.170 
get hung tangle around the camera and
the<00:02:44.459> mount<00:02:49.819> yep

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the mount yep

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.550 
the mount yep
just<00:02:52.140> insert<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.010> number<00:02:53.790> ten<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.720> think<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
just insert the number ten I think it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.830 
just insert the number ten I think it
was<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> two<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.220> half<00:02:56.430> inch<00:02:56.730> screw<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.420> had<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
was a two and a half inch screw I had to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.030 
was a two and a half inch screw I had to
cut<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:59.640> little<00:03:00.390> bit<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.769> fits

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
cut down a little bit so that it fits

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.720 
cut down a little bit so that it fits
perfectly<00:03:02.640> around<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.510> carbon<00:03:04.260> barrel<00:03:09.620> yeah

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
perfectly around this carbon barrel yeah

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:22.699 
perfectly around this carbon barrel yeah
I<00:03:11.730> also<00:03:12.390> use<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.980> island<00:03:15.290> lock<00:03:16.290> nut<00:03:21.709> yeah

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
I also use this the island lock nut yeah

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.370 
I also use this the island lock nut yeah
I<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:23.100> didn't<00:03:23.340> want<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.700> over<00:03:24.690> tighten<00:03:24.959> too

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
I just didn't want to over tighten too

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.030 
I just didn't want to over tighten too
much<00:03:25.590> because<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.430> carbon<00:03:26.819> barrel<00:03:27.180> so

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:48.280 

it's<00:03:32.040> tight<00:03:32.310> enough<00:03:32.610> but<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.510> not<00:03:33.720> too<00:03:33.959> tight

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:04:15.349 

okay<00:03:49.290> looks<00:03:49.620> good

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.720 

okay<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:17.109> came<00:04:17.950> out<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.430> test<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:19.000> amount<00:04:20.730> new

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
okay I came out to test the amount new

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.550 
okay I came out to test the amount new
mount<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:24.360> didn't<00:04:25.360> want<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.570> use<00:04:25.750> my<00:04:25.810> hero3

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
mount and I didn't want to use my hero3

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:39.180 
mount and I didn't want to use my hero3
for<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.730> test<00:04:28.110> it's<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.290> hero<00:04:29.620> too<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:39.010> can

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
for this test it's a hero too as you can

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.409 
for this test it's a hero too as you can
see<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:40.380> mount<00:04:41.380> is<00:04:41.890> pretty<00:04:42.250> stable<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.060> shape

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
see the mount is pretty stable and shape

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.030 
see the mount is pretty stable and shape
to<00:04:43.600> nuts<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.380> think<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.950> success<00:04:47.040> and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
to nuts so I think it's a success and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.760 
to nuts so I think it's a success and

strap and dumb mount and spear gun mount
gives<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:56.350> much<00:04:56.590> more<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:57.130> know<00:04:57.250> closer<00:04:57.610> look

gives you much more you know closer look
to<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.300> fish<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.260> get<00:04:59.410> much<00:04:59.620> more

definition<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:12.720> here's<00:05:13.720> another<00:05:14.080> example

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
definition and here's another example

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:23.090 
definition and here's another example
like<00:05:15.430> sand<00:05:16.030> bass<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.479> can<00:05:16.600> see<00:05:16.840> much<00:05:17.940> clearer

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.980 

and<00:05:24.100> here's<00:05:24.640> some<00:05:24.880> school<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.330> sardines

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
and here's some school of sardines

and here's some school of sardines
I<00:05:27.390> think<00:05:28.390> this<00:05:28.570> setup<00:05:28.840> worked<00:05:29.200> out<00:05:29.410> well

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
I think this setup worked out well

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.260 
I think this setup worked out well
