00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.020 

I<00:00:27.769> love<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.949> project<00:00:29.840> partly<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.020> of

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
I love this project partly because of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.130 
I love this project partly because of
the<00:00:33.140> lack<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> finish<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:36.690> rare

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the lack of finish and the rare

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
the lack of finish and the rare
opportunity<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.949> really<00:00:38.610> let<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> structure

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
opportunity to really let the structure

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.270 
opportunity to really let the structure
be<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> finish<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
be the finish and I think that is

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.970 
be the finish and I think that is
something<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.610> often<00:00:45.089> explored

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
something is not often explored

unfortunately in a lot of homes a lot of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.640 
unfortunately in a lot of homes a lot of

chance<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.820> let<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> builders<00:00:55.110> have

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
chance to let what the builders have

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.170
