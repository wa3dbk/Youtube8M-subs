00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
can see that I do create a little point

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.090 
can see that I do create a little point
there<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.459> very<00:04:20.880> obvious<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:22.350> afterwards<00:04:22.980> I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
there it's very obvious but afterwards I

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.100 
there it's very obvious but afterwards I
like<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.520> just<00:04:23.700> blend<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.210> out<00:04:24.330> with<00:04:24.360> my<00:04:24.540> hands

like to just blend it out with my hands

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.620 
like to just blend it out with my hands
which<00:04:25.320> makes<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.770> look<00:04:25.919> more<00:04:26.100> natural<00:04:26.640> then

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
which makes it look more natural then
