00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hi, people can continue to do this. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 hairstyle I also leave some photos 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 When did I use it for you to see? 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.160
 I decided to record it because I have one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 marriage I was going to be skinny and all 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 world she played very closed to whom 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 I did not know in penalty that I did not 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 I think it's already done, it was my mother. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.939
 so I asked to take part 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.220
 in this video because I can not 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.660
 make hairstyles on myself but if it is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
 more skilled I think I can do 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 alone and also then if you want 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.189
 learn it is not difficult it is sin you 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 know how to make a braid is well 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.000
 easy for anyone who knows how to do it then 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000
 cold or how to speak 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.600
 so we have to start doing 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.600
 a normal built-in braid 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.680
 so as you can see we will 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.470
 picking up a bit of each 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.120
 side and joining with the dance and if so 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.120
 What you do is not the braid 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.700
 So we'll do it in the middle of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.660
 hair is on one side and then we 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.180
 will do the other side I'll go ahead 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.380
 a little video that is the same thing 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.380
 everything is natural 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.660
 now learning from a ball of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 Silicone, but then you're going to miss it. 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.580
 turning to the ground 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.430
 Now you 're doing it on the other side of the head. 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:13.049
 the same thing 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:17.760
 transmitted and ending is worth plus or 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:21.900
 less and then the student now took my 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 two sides of the two braids and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.930
 will begin to draw a normal braid 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.880
 with some pieces of france will be 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530
 transmitted from one side to the other 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.860
 transmitted from the other and the hair 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.239
 left in the middle will form the other part 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.239
 to be able to launch 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.410
 I think're giving to understand right 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.410
 it is a normal change as well 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.490
 There you roll traffic making a coke. 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.190
 over there 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.760
 and just hold with the clamp 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:10.870
 There you put a lot of staple to be sure. 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.870
 that you will not come back and fix it 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.070
 there will be fixing to not stay nor 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.970
 a little thread out 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.140
 this makes it quite white then 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.790
 hidden you buy a color clip 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.090
 your hair obviously into the camera 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.090
 hidden 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.310
 Now you're lurking, authorizing 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.400
 to be low I leave the name him enough 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.320
 You see what I get loose at you. 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.510
 is going to fix this star 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.150
 helps to fix and straighten hair 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.100
 this is a shape that has this ball 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.230
 I also bought a small flower at the point of 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.050
 fairies at bh shopping 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.239
 but today jewelry is usually there 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.430
 you put it in the hair by screwing 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:19.070
 put two sides and put 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:25.610
 three of me in my mother did not put three in 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:31.160
 each and there was the braid part of 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.290
 behind the side close fans also liked 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.300
 play for me that will be in the disclosure 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.919
 of the video even a channel for the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.419
 next videos you like videos 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.370
 closed wanting too much 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.000
 leave in the comments the kiss until the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.000
 next video
