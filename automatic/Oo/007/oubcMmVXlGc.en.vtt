grappling with the police officer the
idea<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:40.790> they<00:00:41.090> pull<00:00:41.630> this<00:00:41.840> out<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.260> use

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
idea is that they pull this out and use

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.730 
idea is that they pull this out and use
the<00:00:43.220> very<00:00:43.460> wicked<00:00:43.670> point<00:00:44.120> an<00:00:44.360> edge<00:00:44.630> to<00:00:44.960> do<00:00:45.530> with

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
the very wicked point an edge to do with

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.960 
the very wicked point an edge to do with
their<00:00:46.220> attacker<00:00:47.260> now<00:00:48.260> as<00:00:48.860> you<00:00:49.040> can<00:00:49.160> see<00:00:49.220> it<00:00:49.700> is

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
their attacker now as you can see it is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.190 
their attacker now as you can see it is
tiny<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.220> very<00:00:52.220> very<00:00:52.550> sharp<00:00:53.200> penetrates

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
tiny and very very sharp penetrates

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.860 
tiny and very very sharp penetrates
extremely<00:00:55.070> well<00:00:55.250> with<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:55.579> point<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.840> is

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
extremely well with this point and it is

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.760 
extremely well with this point and it is
definitely<00:00:57.590> shaving<00:00:58.340> sharp<00:00:59.260> as<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.380> can<00:01:00.560> see

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
definitely shaving sharp as you can see

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.210 
definitely shaving sharp as you can see
it's<00:01:00.890> got<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.870> chicken<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:04.009> bag

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
it's got the chicken that the the bag

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.819 
it's got the chicken that the the bag
and<00:01:04.549> little<00:01:05.119> bit<00:01:05.210> on<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.390> front<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:05.990> can

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
and little bit on the front so that can

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.450 
and little bit on the front so that can
be<00:01:06.979> held<00:01:07.270> like<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:09.229> isn't<00:01:09.680> fantastically

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
be held like so it isn't fantastically

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.250 
be held like so it isn't fantastically
comfortable<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.270> hold<00:01:11.420> for<00:01:11.750> any<00:01:11.870> length<00:01:12.080> of

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
comfortable to hold for any length of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.980 
comfortable to hold for any length of
time<00:01:12.640> but<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.820> would<00:01:13.970> imagine<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:14.659> isn't

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
time but I would imagine this isn't

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.270 
time but I would imagine this isn't
going<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.290> held<00:01:15.530> for<00:01:15.740> more<00:01:15.890> than<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.070> few

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
going to be held for more than a few

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.180 
going to be held for more than a few
seconds<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:17.690> if<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.200> place<00:01:18.799> of<00:01:18.979> so

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
seconds this is just if a place of so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.880 
seconds this is just if a place of so
that<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.729> opportunity<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.680> persuade<00:01:21.680> his

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
that the opportunity to persuade his

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.860 
that the opportunity to persuade his
attacker<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.490> get<00:01:22.670> off<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.150> can<00:01:23.270> get<00:01:23.390> spiral

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
attacker to get off so it can get spiral

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.950 
attacker to get off so it can get spiral
now<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:25.970> isn't<00:01:26.150> really<00:01:26.330> going<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:26.900> in

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
now so this isn't really going to be in

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.670 
now so this isn't really going to be in
your<00:01:27.049> hand<00:01:27.290> film<00:01:27.650> if<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:27.920> not<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.320> then<00:01:30.320> the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
your hand film if it's not and then the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.990 
your hand film if it's not and then the
kind<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.070> knife<00:01:31.220> you're<00:01:31.460> going<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.640> use<00:01:31.820> for

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
kind of knife you're going to use for

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120 
kind of knife you're going to use for
opening<00:01:32.270> cardboard<00:01:32.659> boxes<00:01:33.049> as<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.680> can<00:01:33.890> see

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.230 
it's pretty thin blade stock and that
tip<00:01:39.650> may<00:01:39.920> or<00:01:40.070> may<00:01:40.220> not<00:01:40.250> last<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:40.970> wouldn't

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
tip may or may not last but I wouldn't
