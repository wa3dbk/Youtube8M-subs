00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.760

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.889
 but why I have a good one 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.500
 reason for I was on vacation 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.630
 nice to the Ardennes and yes that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 was nice to be away for a while 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.250
 his finish I was not for a long time 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.490
 present so well very long i was just 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.619
 not present for a while and therefore the king 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 had to do it alone for a while 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 to sweetheart currently still has 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.810
 but a duke and yes that's it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 actually 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.100
 so quite it was slightly busier for mark 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.570
 our come our king so but i am 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.660
 I'm just going back a bit 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 show what has changed 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.070
 a does not change very much 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.789
 I'll give it a first so I'll go to you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 yes these are now still vlogging sort of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.390
 ugly holes with stairs but that becomes 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 fixed because yes that is of course still 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 not so very beautiful i will be the first to see you 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 show the royal warehouses 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.290
 the new royal store I 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.909
 made four stairs here in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 books 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.330
 because kicking in is ugly so I make it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.799
 only four 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 so I'm going to let you see that in 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.729
 very many people think it is very wild 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.759
 like to have a look because we are in the pie 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.630
 our royal store and everyone wants 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.210
 eat that cake 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 nature to you just a little tump 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.920
 don't really shit much in there 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 furnace 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 and then here in the top we have the storage 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.320
 and we kind of have storage for that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 previous yes we have enough storage stairs 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.250
 I think only a little pussy but makes 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.119
 not from above and I don't know yet 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.829
 what's coming 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.930
 or the butt nothing will come on 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.700
 what or I could not do anything 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.560
 at least this is just for now 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 enough about to fuck i died 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 ok that info was forgotten 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 yes that is actually royal store 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 weening you want hey how badly 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.549
 see what's in it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.380
 so let's see you can put on a bit 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.319
 we don't have a lot of shit on mark 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.150
 mark always throws it with such a whole one 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.430
 pretty ornamental 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.330
 he colors that in those tests without it 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.160
 he sort it a bit and i am 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.420
 very much like sorting 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.230
 so i'm going to make this all a bit nice 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.220
 so side by side and him 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.430
 This is number not growth pieces of liquid 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.080
 grow a little they were heavy 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.930
 angry cat but they are all good 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.040
 brooks potions 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.040
 another word 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.910
 so yeah i guess everyone put it on it 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.670
 Pope has set this I will not leave 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 because then everyone starts crying 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.569
 no i don't know i just won't let it 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.160
 see no sense in how i do it in any 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.299
 case 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.090
 what we have also done is a bit 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.920
 we have strengthened the defense 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.799
 canal 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.709
 yes the powerful excavated to 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.250
 there are people who own the canals 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.440
 so we now have a whole 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.560
 great deal of strength in what did hold 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.930
 because it is now very chill james 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.430
 wade not super spijk 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.980
 super mouse there also after own ground whole 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.900
 canal is a bit 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.910
 gone like that 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.889
 also there are people to a few 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.170
 Thailand and temples as you pass by 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.389
 so been the one in the south one 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.739
 few houses that were a bit bloated 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.760
 but now I 'm going to run after stuck 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.230
 those houses are long gone 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.720
 met so don't actually do it oh yes 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.200
 under tension I still have now 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.090
 what made this was the old store 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.069
 and mark who has here once 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.660
 think that yolo i make all the boxes 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.090
 broke down and laughed everything on the floor me 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.139
 got all there for a moment 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.940
 at least i have it here one 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.370
 bit on 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.680
 appropriate I have a bit because we have 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.980
 hang here and this is the one pp construction team 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.510
 and storage stef because we like we want 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.840
 have summer storage on there are we want 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.730
 like everyone from the store or that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.200
 say that shit it is sorted 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.380
 because that is nice 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.600
 Here we nobility relationship with other kingdom 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.930
 are in rules 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.260
 this is yes now say all knight 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.190
 all reason two they no reason 3 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.820
 an autumn king and that's it 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.680
 five willows and then the relationship with this 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.450
 the other king numbers 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.270
 which is not really very chill at the moment 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.760
 is my husband that it all comes 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.330
 good 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.920
 a project is underway here 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.440
 I had a temper server Sweetheart 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.670
 could have made bold design from the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.800
 of a new throne room and that becomes 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.390
 built here and it will really be further 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.040
 he gets really fat so I leave that 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.750
 next time see that alternately 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.000
 things that are finished are nice to leave 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.200
 because they are not finished 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.630
 so five years becomes work in each 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.950
 case this i will show next time i 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.900
 really wanted to have a start fluid this is 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.370
 you can no longer mark it completely, so me 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.830
 think the connected will be achieved 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.660
 because he wants a kind of me a lot 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.730
 throne room 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.440
 yes I will no vd wanted to make it here 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.840
 of this this becomes a new how you 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.000
 Too little to see people passing through 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.440
 seeing to see how the word and 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.419
 You have already seen it 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.150
 for the viewers of other kingdoms 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.760
 unfortunately you don't get to see it now 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.440
 you have to wait a while i say people 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.169
 until next time 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.530
 I say again until next time 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.530
 later on
