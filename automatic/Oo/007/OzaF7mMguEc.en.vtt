00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey everyone we're back with another

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.480 
hey everyone we're back with another
video<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.899> destiny<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.859> what<00:00:05.009> we're<00:00:05.160> looking

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
video of destiny and what we're looking

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.579 
video of destiny and what we're looking
at<00:00:05.580> here<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.029> ghost<00:00:06.509> toy<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.020> came<00:00:07.259> with

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
at here is that ghost toy that came with

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.610 
at here is that ghost toy that came with
the<00:00:08.040> ghost<00:00:08.730> edition<00:00:09.300> or<00:00:09.630> collector's<00:00:10.080> edition

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the ghost edition or collector's edition

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.759 
the ghost edition or collector's edition
and<00:00:11.389> we've<00:00:12.389> been<00:00:12.599> trying<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> figure<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.559> what

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and we've been trying to figure out what

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.400 
and we've been trying to figure out what
it<00:00:13.920> does<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.820> uh<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.750> why<00:00:16.020> don't<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.230> come

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
it does so uh well why don't you come

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.870 
it does so uh well why don't you come
over<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:16.949> turn<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.670> first

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
over here and turn it on like you first

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.849 
over here and turn it on like you first
did<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.449> then<00:00:18.539> we'll<00:00:19.050> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> take<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> look

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
did and then we'll kind of take a look

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.849 
did and then we'll kind of take a look
at<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.720> think<00:00:21.720> there's<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:21.990> three<00:00:22.410> modes

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
at it I think there's like three modes

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:52.670 
at it I think there's like three modes
right<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.760> does<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.960> off<00:00:25.400> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.970 

all<00:00:53.680> right<00:00:53.829> essentially<00:00:54.520> there<00:00:55.060> is<00:00:55.980> three

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
all right essentially there is three

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.710 
all right essentially there is three
modes<00:00:57.340> first<00:00:58.059> mode<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:59.400> some<00:01:00.400> ghost<00:01:00.910> mode<00:01:01.300> and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
modes first mode is some ghost mode and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
modes first mode is some ghost mode and
essentially<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.410> ghost<00:01:02.680> mode<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.740> I

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
essentially the ghost mode is one and I

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.650 
essentially the ghost mode is one and I
think<00:01:06.070> all<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.400> does<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:07.000> lights<00:01:07.330> off

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
think all it does is lights off

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.960 
think all it does is lights off
according<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.800> manual<00:01:09.250> anyways

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
according to the manual anyways

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.010 
according to the manual anyways
and<00:01:10.510> since<00:01:11.229> we're<00:01:12.690> waiting<00:01:13.690> for<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
and since we're waiting for the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.660 
and since we're waiting for the
installation<00:01:14.770> that's<00:01:14.950> why<00:01:15.100> we're<00:01:15.280> doing<00:01:15.400> this

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
installation that's why we're doing this

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.810 
installation that's why we're doing this
video<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.380> yeah<00:01:17.830> that's<00:01:18.100> all<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.280> does<00:01:18.580> in

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
video and yeah that's all it does in

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.499 
video and yeah that's all it does in
first<00:01:19.060> mode<00:01:19.360> well<00:01:20.280> from<00:01:21.280> what<00:01:21.550> from<00:01:22.270> what<00:01:22.390> the

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
first mode well from what from what the

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.580 
first mode well from what from what the
manual<00:01:22.869> says<00:01:23.170> where's<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.500> manual<00:01:25.410> all<00:01:26.410> right

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
manual says where's the manual all right

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
manual says where's the manual all right
so<00:01:26.950> let's<00:01:27.910> grab<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.630> manual<00:01:29.289> over<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:29.890> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
so let's grab the manual over here and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.469 
so let's grab the manual over here and
English<00:01:32.920> now<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.490> thing<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.700> separated<00:01:34.360> into

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
English now this thing is separated into

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.779 
English now this thing is separated into
a<00:01:34.660> lot<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.229> languages<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:38.789> turns

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
a lot of languages and here it is turns

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.270 
a lot of languages and here it is turns
on<00:01:39.970> LED<00:01:40.450> light<00:01:40.780> cycles<00:01:41.440> through<00:01:41.649> brightness

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
on LED light cycles through brightness

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.480 
on LED light cycles through brightness
levels<00:01:42.700> then<00:01:42.910> fades<00:01:43.330> by<00:01:43.660> standby<00:01:44.380> no<00:01:44.680> audio<00:01:45.220> in

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
levels then fades by standby no audio in

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.029 
levels then fades by standby no audio in
this<00:01:45.640> mode<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.119> that's<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.479> first<00:01:46.750> mode

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
this mode so that's the first mode

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.350 
this mode so that's the first mode
second<00:01:48.039> mode<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.220> actually<00:01:49.000> called<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
second mode is actually called the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.950 
second mode is actually called the
motion<00:01:50.050> sensing<00:01:50.710> mode<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:52.390> front<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.840> the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
motion sensing mode in front of the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.339 
motion sensing mode in front of the
ghosts<00:01:53.440> triggers<00:01:54.280> LED<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.209> random<00:01:55.869> sound

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
ghosts triggers LED and random sound

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.120 
ghosts triggers LED and random sound
clips<00:01:57.119> alright<00:01:58.119> let's<00:01:58.569> go<00:01:58.750> into<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.649> loss

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
clips alright let's go into the loss

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:20.400 
clips alright let's go into the loss
mode<00:02:00.580> now<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.300> volume<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.900> coming<00:02:20.260> out<00:02:20.380> of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
mode now so the volume is coming out of

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.270 
mode now so the volume is coming out of
this<00:02:20.680> thing

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
this thing

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
this thing
that's<00:02:22.180> pretty<00:02:22.510> much<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> can't<00:02:23.560> figure<00:02:23.800> out

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that's pretty much it I can't figure out

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.650 
that's pretty much it I can't figure out
anything<00:02:24.250> else<00:02:24.520> other<00:02:24.819> than<00:02:25.090> there's<00:02:25.599> a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
anything else other than there's a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.390 
anything else other than there's a
charging<00:02:26.140> port<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.830> last<00:02:27.069> mode<00:02:27.370> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
charging port and then the last mode is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.880 
charging port and then the last mode is
off<00:02:27.880> which<00:02:28.690> means<00:02:28.930> turning<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.590> off<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.739> can

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
off which means turning it off you can

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.260 
off which means turning it off you can
hear<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.130> he<00:02:33.370> said<00:02:33.550> he's<00:02:33.670> not<00:02:33.790> going<00:02:34.120> into

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
hear that he said he's not going into

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.059 
hear that he said he's not going into
that<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:34.720> into<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.110> box

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:57.890 

alright<00:02:39.069> let's<00:02:39.550> actually<00:02:39.819> view<00:02:40.239> at<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.480> box

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.330 

all<00:02:58.900> right<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.049> can't<00:02:59.319> say<00:02:59.530> he's<00:02:59.739> sensing

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
all right I can't say he's sensing

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.990 
all right I can't say he's sensing
anything<00:03:00.700> because<00:03:00.969> he's<00:03:01.299> looking<00:03:01.629> at<00:03:01.719> the<00:03:01.840> box

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
anything because he's looking at the box

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.259 
anything because he's looking at the box
and<00:03:04.170> nothing<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.319> really<00:03:05.739> happening<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.939> yeah

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
and nothing is really happening but yeah

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.000 
and nothing is really happening but yeah
that<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.689> about<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.319> wanted<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.769> show

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
that is about it I just wanted to show

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.599 
that is about it I just wanted to show
you<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.280> thing<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:10.359> pretty<00:03:10.659> cool<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.609> that

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
you this thing it's pretty cool and that

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.339 
you this thing it's pretty cool and that
that's<00:03:12.909> pretty<00:03:13.090> much<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> thought<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.200> had

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
that's pretty much it I thought it had

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.899 
that's pretty much it I thought it had
