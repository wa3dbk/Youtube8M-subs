00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
my thyroid was a little high which means

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.630 
my thyroid was a little high which means
it's<00:00:36.180> under<00:00:36.480> active<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.219> loveth<00:00:38.520> or

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
should be no problem to regulate because

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
should be no problem to regulate because
I<00:00:42.329> wasn't<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.590> 3.2<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> they

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I wasn't I was then at 3.2 and it they

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.369 
I wasn't I was then at 3.2 and it they

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
she would like it out like a 2.0 so it's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
she would like it out like a 2.0 so it's
not<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> hard<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> regulate

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
not not gonna be that hard to regulate

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.540 
not not gonna be that hard to regulate
that<00:00:48.480> um<00:00:49.489> but<00:00:50.489> she<00:00:50.640> did<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:50.969> stuff<00:00:51.270> otherwise

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
was was my AMH level which this this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.359 
was was my AMH level which this this
kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> tells<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.480> egg<00:01:03.780> supply<00:01:04.369> looks

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
kind of tells what your egg supply looks

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.390 
kind of tells what your egg supply looks
like<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.290> she<00:01:07.290> said<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:07.680> egg<00:01:07.950> supply<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
like and she said that my egg supply is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.890 
like and she said that my egg supply is
too<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.119> diminishing<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:14.780> there<00:01:15.780> was

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
too is diminishing and that there was

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.770 
too is diminishing and that there was
another<00:01:16.080> follicle<00:01:16.619> test<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.420> blood<00:01:18.600> work

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
another follicle test in the blood work

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
another follicle test in the blood work
somewhere<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> she<00:01:20.130> she<00:01:20.280> compared<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.790> side

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
somewhere and she she compared them side

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.440 
somewhere and she she compared them side
by<00:01:21.030> side<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.549> she<00:01:23.549> said<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> follicle<00:01:24.240> one

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
by side and she said the follicle one

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
by side and she said the follicle one
showed<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.080> few<00:01:25.890> more<00:01:26.040> eggs

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
showed a few more eggs

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.719 
showed a few more eggs
but<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.720> AMH<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> base<00:01:28.979> line<00:01:29.159> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
but the AMH which is the base line that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.160 
but the AMH which is the base line that
they<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.420> look<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.930> egg<00:01:31.170> reserve<00:01:33.170> was

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
they use to look at your egg reserve was

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.310 
they use to look at your egg reserve was
was<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.829> bad<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.369> um<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.750> she<00:01:36.810> said<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
was pretty bad so um so she said that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.880 
was pretty bad so um so she said that
most<00:01:37.710> likely<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.430> egg<00:01:38.670> quality<00:01:39.530> no<00:01:40.530> actually

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
most likely my egg quality no actually

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.679 
most likely my egg quality no actually
it<00:01:41.130> actually<00:01:41.490> showed<00:01:41.700> quality<00:01:42.210> -<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.420> she

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it actually showed quality - and she

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:51.590 
it actually showed quality - and she
said<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> quality<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.520> pretty<00:01:44.520> bad<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> um<00:01:50.600> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
said the quality was pretty bad so um so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.340 
said the quality was pretty bad so um so
it's<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.869> fault

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's my fault

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:04.609 
it's my fault
and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 

so<00:02:05.189> she<00:02:05.310> doesn't<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.359> IUI

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so she doesn't want to do with the IUI

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.140 
so she doesn't want to do with the IUI
with<00:02:06.780> injectables<00:02:07.700> because<00:02:08.700> she<00:02:08.970> wants<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:11.150> do

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
with injectables because she wants to do

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.600 
with injectables because she wants to do
IVF<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.810> soon<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.110> possible<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:14.400> she

IVF as soon as possible because she

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.400 
IVF as soon as possible because she
feels<00:02:14.879> that<00:02:15.030> she<00:02:15.450> wants<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.879> you<00:02:17.879> know<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.410> need

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
knowing that my egg supply is not good

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.259 
knowing that my egg supply is not good
and<00:03:55.859> that<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> quality<00:03:56.639> is<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.760> good<00:03:57.239> I

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
and that the quality is that good I

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.289 
and that the quality is that good I
don't<00:03:57.540> feel<00:03:57.750> good<00:03:57.989> about<00:03:58.139> an<00:03:58.410> egg<00:03:58.560> retrieval

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.300 

she<00:04:03.299> even<00:04:03.510> said<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.750> if<00:04:04.019> we<00:04:04.169> if<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.739> if<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
she even said that if we if we if the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.280 
she even said that if we if we if the
egg<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.880> know<00:04:06.000> if<00:04:06.180> we<00:04:06.389> do<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> retrieval<00:04:06.989> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
egg you know if we do a retrieval and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.780 
egg you know if we do a retrieval and
the<00:04:07.440> egg<00:04:07.560> quality<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.099> good<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.489> she<00:04:08.669> would

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the egg quality is good that she would

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.670 
the egg quality is good that she would
recommend<00:04:09.269> putting<00:04:09.540> two<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.019> instead<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.500> one

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
recommend putting two in instead of one

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.459 
recommend putting two in instead of one
so<00:04:10.980> we<00:04:11.130> obviously<00:04:11.280> would<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:13.040> I

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:15.469
