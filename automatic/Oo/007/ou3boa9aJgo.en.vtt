it's<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.480> turn<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it's time to really like turn up the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.740 
it's time to really like turn up the
intensity<00:01:01.350> yes<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.100> mean<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.449> times

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
intensity yes I mean you know it's times

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
intensity yes I mean you know it's times
in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.229> where<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.650> know<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> lose<00:01:05.280> your

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
in the game where you know you lose your

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
in the game where you know you lose your
momentum<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.409> kind<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
momentum and you know I just kind of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
momentum and you know I just kind of
just<00:01:08.790> feed<00:01:09.030> off<00:01:09.060> each<00:01:09.240> other<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.840> those

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
just feed off each other in those

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
just feed off each other in those
moments<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.799> guess<00:01:11.040> tonight<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> those

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
moments I guess tonight was one of those

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
moments I guess tonight was one of those
times<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.530> saw<00:01:13.770> him

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
times and you know I really saw him

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
times and you know I really saw him
picking<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.400> defensively<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.180> told

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
picking it up defensively and I told

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.210 
picking it up defensively and I told
myself<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.900> gotta<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> an

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
myself I gotta do more I make more of an

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
myself I gotta do more I make more of an
impact<00:01:17.310> offensively<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> always<00:01:19.020> starts

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
impact offensively and it always starts

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
impact offensively and it always starts
with<00:01:19.619> usually<00:01:20.100> Russell<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> ball<00:01:20.909> he's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
with usually Russell on the ball he's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
with usually Russell on the ball he's
makes<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> play<00:01:21.810> gets<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> crowd<00:01:22.350> involved

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
makes the play gets the crowd involved

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.870 
makes the play gets the crowd involved
and<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> feed<00:01:23.939> off<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.119> deal

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
and you know I feed off that deal

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.179 
and you know I feed off that deal
and<00:01:25.969> I<00:01:26.030> think<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.299> whole<00:01:26.390> team<00:01:26.689> does<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.259> he's

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
and I think the whole team does so he's

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.800 
and I think the whole team does so he's
been<00:01:28.340> doing<00:01:28.399> a<00:01:28.670> good<00:01:28.789> job<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:29.630> just
