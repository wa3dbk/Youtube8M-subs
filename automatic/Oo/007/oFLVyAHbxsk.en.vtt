tutorial videos and first thing I'm

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.150 
tutorial videos and first thing I'm
going<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> do<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.230> I'm<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.620> set<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:10.950> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
going to do is I'm going to set up a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.820 
going to do is I'm going to set up a
project<00:00:11.580> about<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.150> web<00:00:13.110> project<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> make

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
project about a web project but to make

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.950 
project about a web project but to make
when<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.130> go<00:00:14.309> new<00:00:14.549> new<00:00:14.940> single<00:00:15.299> user<00:00:15.450> project

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
when you go new new single user project

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.019 
when you go new new single user project
project<00:00:16.560> name<00:00:16.890> or<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.250> want<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> save<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.609> then

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
project name or you want to save it then

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.240 
project name or you want to save it then
finish<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.320> I've<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.710> mine<00:00:19.920> right<00:00:19.949> here

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
finish so I've just got mine right here

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.540 
finish so I've just got mine right here
in<00:00:20.369> ventricles<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:22.070> first<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.490> make

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
in ventricles so first I'm going to make

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.259 
in ventricles so first I'm going to make
is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.240> end<00:00:24.390> plate<00:00:25.310> I'm<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> get

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
is the end plate I'm just going to get

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.980 
is the end plate I'm just going to get
started<00:00:27.510> right<00:00:27.660> in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
started right in

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.919 
started right in
so<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.820> first<00:00:30.060> excursion<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> do

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
so the first excursion I'm going to do

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
so the first excursion I'm going to do
is<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.289> simple<00:00:31.590> box<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.340> click<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is just a simple box so I just click the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
is just a simple box so I just click the
box<00:00:33.000> button<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.719> I'll<00:00:34.020> go<00:00:34.200> faster

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
box button up here I'll go faster

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
box button up here I'll go faster
and<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.309> Google<00:00:35.610> everything<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.420> XY

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and I'm Google everything on this XY

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.369 
and I'm Google everything on this XY
plane<00:00:39.800> just<00:00:40.800> bare<00:00:41.100> metal<00:00:41.309> best<00:00:41.640> practices<00:00:42.379> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
plane just bare metal best practices so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
plane just bare metal best practices so
because<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.770> did<00:00:43.920> box<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.940> those<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
because I did box and those I'm going to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.760 
because I did box and those I'm going to
do<00:00:45.570> box<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> before<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.510> click<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> put

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
do box so before I even click it put

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.340 
do box so before I even click it put
down<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.489> box<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> center<00:00:51.570> point<00:00:51.780> box

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
down my box this is a center point box

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.330 
down my box this is a center point box
by<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:54.110> rectangle<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
by the way a rectangle and which is a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
by the way a rectangle and which is a
which<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> automatically<00:00:57.660> selects<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
which it automatically selects if you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
which it automatically selects if you
choose<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> box<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> before<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> click<00:01:02.609> if

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
choose to do a box so before I click if

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
choose to do a box so before I click if
I<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.110> highlighted<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I you can see that it's highlighted the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.539 
I you can see that it's highlighted the
dimension<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.860> type<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.520> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
dimension so if I just type in what I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.530 
dimension so if I just type in what I
want<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> 4<00:01:09.689> inches<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.619> will

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
want so this is 4 inches it will

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
want so this is 4 inches it will
automatically<00:01:12.540> put<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.290> press<00:01:13.500> tab

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
automatically put that is if I press tab

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
automatically put that is if I press tab
it'll<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> next<00:01:14.430> field<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.540> put

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it'll go to the next field I can put

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.710 
it'll go to the next field I can put
another<00:01:15.780> 4<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.560> enter<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> automatically

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
another 4 and enter and it automatically

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.940 
another 4 and enter and it automatically
dimensions<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.060> box<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
dimensions it you can see so this box is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
dimensions it you can see so this box is
half<00:01:22.950> an<00:01:23.100> inch<00:01:23.220> wide<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:25.040> strip

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
half an inch wide and I'm going to strip

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.460 
half an inch wide and I'm going to strip
it<00:01:26.070> symmetrically<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it symmetrically that way because the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
it symmetrically that way because the
sketch<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> XY<00:01:29.549> plane<00:01:29.579> I've<00:01:30.180> already

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
sketch was on the XY plane I've already

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.270 
sketch was on the XY plane I've already
got<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> mid<00:01:30.930> plane<00:01:31.170> built<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.159> be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
got a mid plane built in and don't be

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
got a mid plane built in and don't be
useful<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.759> need<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> mirror<00:01:33.509> reflect

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
useful if I need to mirror reflect

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.569 
useful if I need to mirror reflect
things<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:35.869> well<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.500> guess<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
things or well I don't know I guess I

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.039 
things or well I don't know I guess I
really<00:01:38.610> only<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.390> marrying<00:01:39.810> things

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
really only use it for marrying things

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.450 
really only use it for marrying things
but<00:01:40.290> double<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
but double you don't have to go to the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
but double you don't have to go to the
midpoint<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.299> mid<00:01:42.540> plane<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> very

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
midpoint or a mid plane which is very

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.609 
midpoint or a mid plane which is very
nice<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.810> when<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.049> super<00:01:46.439> critical

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
nice and when that's not super critical

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.600 
nice and when that's not super critical
but<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.220> bare<00:01:47.579> metal<00:01:47.759> best<00:01:48.060> practices<00:01:48.810> um<00:01:49.610> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
but just bare metal best practices um so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.359 
but just bare metal best practices um so
I'm<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.329> my<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.140> couple<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.189> holes

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'm not going to do my a couple of holes

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.940 
I'm not going to do my a couple of holes
here<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.990> lots<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> ways<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.860> do

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
here so there are lots of ways I can do

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
here so there are lots of ways I can do
this<00:01:56.130> probably<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> fastest<00:01:57.689> cleanest<00:01:58.500> way<00:01:58.649> I

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this probably the fastest cleanest way I

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
this probably the fastest cleanest way I
could<00:01:58.979> dig<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.909> I'm<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.540> an

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
could dig up is I'm going to do an

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.780 
could dig up is I'm going to do an
offset<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:03.110> half<00:02:04.110> inch<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.640> author

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
offset here and half inch is the author

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.139 
offset here and half inch is the author
and<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> could<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.770> put<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> point<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.640> each

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and now I could just put a point at each

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.410 
and now I could just put a point at each
of<00:02:09.300> these<00:02:09.420> corners

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.000 

so<00:02:14.420> now<00:02:14.750> I've<00:02:14.900> got<00:02:15.110> each<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.620> these<00:02:15.709> points

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
so now I've got each of these points

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.230 
so now I've got each of these points
added<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.390> 1/2<00:02:17.720> inch<00:02:17.959> half<00:02:18.319> inch<00:02:18.530> or<00:02:19.370> added

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
added in and 1/2 inch half inch or added

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.120 
added in and 1/2 inch half inch or added
in<00:02:20.360> 1/2<00:02:20.660> inch<00:02:20.900> from<00:02:21.170> each<00:02:21.260> side<00:02:21.560> which<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.950> what

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
in 1/2 inch from each side which is what

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.500 
in 1/2 inch from each side which is what
the<00:02:22.280> dimensions<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.790> those<00:02:22.940> holes<00:02:23.180> need<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.420> be

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the dimensions of those holes need to be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.840 
the dimensions of those holes need to be
now<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.740> put<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> dollar<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.550> holes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
now I can put it the dollar of the holes

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.790 
now I can put it the dollar of the holes
here<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> whole<00:02:26.600> function<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.709> that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
here with the whole function and that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.500 
here with the whole function and that
automatically<00:02:28.310> selects<00:02:28.790> those<00:02:28.910> points<00:02:29.330> if<00:02:29.420> I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
automatically selects those points if I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.670 
automatically selects those points if I
wanted<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.260> unselect<00:02:30.860> one<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.190> them<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.520> could

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
wanted to unselect one of them I could

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.490 
wanted to unselect one of them I could
press<00:02:33.680> ctrl<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:34.490> click<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:36.260> click

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
press ctrl and then click or just click

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.610 
press ctrl and then click or just click
again<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:37.010> add<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.060> back<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.320> that's<00:02:39.500> what

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
again to add it back and so that's what

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.420 
again to add it back and so that's what
I<00:02:39.650> want<00:02:39.830> proposals<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:41.440> shibam<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:43.130> those

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
I want proposals and shibam got those

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.370 
I want proposals and shibam got those
four<00:02:43.700> holes<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.120> next<00:02:44.959> I'm<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> add

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
four holes there next I'm going to add

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.590 
four holes there next I'm going to add
in<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> center<00:02:46.160> hole<00:02:46.370> I'm<00:02:47.209> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.570> a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
in the center hole I'm going to do a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.060 
in the center hole I'm going to do a
circle<00:02:48.110> right<00:02:48.290> here<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.209> mention<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:51.070> with

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
circle right here and mention it with

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.580 
circle right here and mention it with
the<00:02:52.220> one<00:02:52.400> inch<00:02:52.580> down<00:02:52.790> as<00:02:53.269> for<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> drawing<00:02:53.959> and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the one inch down as for the drawing and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.530 
the one inch down as for the drawing and
I'm<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.340> going<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.610> extrude<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.209> just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
I'm just going to extrude that just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.440 
I'm just going to extrude that just
showing<00:02:56.810> another<00:02:57.019> way<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:57.860> extrude<00:02:58.450> or

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
showing another way I can extrude or

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.090 
showing another way I can extrude or
just<00:02:59.959> show<00:03:00.140> another<00:03:00.410> way<00:03:00.590> out<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.739> can<00:03:00.950> make

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
just show another way out I can make

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.690 
just show another way out I can make
holes<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:02.570> I've<00:03:02.690> selected<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:04.160> extends

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
holes so I've selected it extends

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.160 
holes so I've selected it extends
through<00:03:04.940> all<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.630> automatically

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
through all and that automatically

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.979 
through all and that automatically
usually<00:03:06.890> goes<00:03:07.040> down<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.400> cut<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:08.330> sometimes

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
usually goes down to cut but sometimes

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.280 
usually goes down to cut but sometimes
if<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.260> stuck<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:09.950> join<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.810> might<00:03:12.170> have

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
if I get stuck on join so you might have

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.470 
if I get stuck on join so you might have
to<00:03:12.350> manually<00:03:12.709> go<00:03:12.950> back<00:03:13.130> down<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.519> cut<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.239> that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
to manually go back down to cut but that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.270 
to manually go back down to cut but that
makes<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.050> cut<00:03:15.230> through<00:03:15.380> everything<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.220> this

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
makes it cut through everything in this

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.550 
makes it cut through everything in this
part<00:03:16.579> as<00:03:17.510> per<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.519> sketch<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:20.230> now<00:03:21.230> I'm

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
part as per that sketch and now I'm

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.130 
part as per that sketch and now I'm
going<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.739> add<00:03:21.860> in<00:03:22.010> these<00:03:22.660> circles<00:03:23.660> these

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
going to add in these circles these

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.470 
going to add in these circles these
holes<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.530> go<00:03:24.709> around<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.459> way<00:03:25.640> I'm<00:03:26.299> going

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
holes that go around this way I'm going

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.960 
holes that go around this way I'm going
to<00:03:26.510> do<00:03:26.660> yet<00:03:27.140> another<00:03:27.170> way<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.040> those<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:28.790> I'm

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
to do yet another way to do those so I'm

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.949 
to do yet another way to do those so I'm
going<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.180> do<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.299> point<00:03:29.980> here<00:03:31.209> no<00:03:32.209> not<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.840> was

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
going to do a point here no not that was

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.600 
going to do a point here no not that was
a<00:03:32.989> joke<00:03:33.230> I'm<00:03:33.440> going<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.680> do<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.799> circle<00:03:34.100> here<00:03:34.459> and

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
a joke I'm going to do a circle here and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.449 
a joke I'm going to do a circle here and
my<00:03:37.610> dam<00:03:37.850> there<00:03:38.239> here<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:40.360> 0.19<00:03:41.920> I'm<00:03:42.920> going<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
my dam there here is 0.19 I'm going to

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.970 
my dam there here is 0.19 I'm going to
horizontally<00:03:44.329> constrain<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.989> there<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.890> you

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
horizontally constrain it there so you

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.069 
horizontally constrain it there so you
can<00:03:49.100> see<00:03:49.250> now<00:03:49.430> oh<00:03:49.670> no<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:50.269> didn't<00:03:50.570> constrain<00:03:50.959> it

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
can see now oh no I didn't constrain it

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.300 
can see now oh no I didn't constrain it
let<00:03:51.980> me<00:03:52.040> get<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.340> again<00:03:53.079> there<00:03:54.079> we<00:03:54.140> go<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> now

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
let me get it again there we go so now

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.759 
let me get it again there we go so now
you<00:03:55.459> can<00:03:55.670> see<00:03:55.820> it'll<00:03:55.940> stay<00:03:56.630> horizontal<00:03:57.620> with

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
you can see it'll stay horizontal with

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.590 
you can see it'll stay horizontal with
this<00:03:57.980> point<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.760> center<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.180> circle<00:03:59.329> to

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
this point the center of this circle to

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.690 
this point the center of this circle to
that<00:03:59.750> point<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.430> now<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.940> dimension<00:04:02.150> this

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
that point and now I can dimension this

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.229 
that point and now I can dimension this
the<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.840> says<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:06.230> these<00:04:06.910> circles<00:04:07.910> are<00:04:08.060> on

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
the so it says that these circles are on

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.060 
the so it says that these circles are on
a<00:04:08.390> larger<00:04:09.200> circle<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.910> 1.65<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.739> five<00:04:12.739> inch

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
a larger circle of 1.65 so five inch

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.509 
a larger circle of 1.65 so five inch
diameter<00:04:14.049> 1.6250<00:04:15.049> divide<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:16.070> by<00:04:16.250> two<00:04:16.310> it

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
diameter 1.6250 divide that by two it

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.159 
diameter 1.6250 divide that by two it
will<00:04:16.609> give<00:04:16.760> me<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.000> radius<00:04:17.390> which<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.989> what<00:04:18.140> I

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
will give me that radius which is what I

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.529 
will give me that radius which is what I
need<00:04:18.410> right<00:04:18.530> there<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.880> can<00:04:19.940> see<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.479> just

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
need right there and you can see I just

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.779 
need right there and you can see I just
typed<00:04:20.959> in<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.260> /<00:04:21.680> -<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.099> inventor<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.700> did

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
typed in the / - and inventor and it did

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.250 
typed in the / - and inventor and it did
it<00:04:22.910> for<00:04:23.090> me<00:04:23.240> which<00:04:23.419> is<00:04:23.539> very<00:04:23.570> nice

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
it for me which is very nice

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.080 
it for me which is very nice
then<00:04:25.650> I'm<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.890> go<00:04:26.040> through<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.580> extrude

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
then I'm going to go through and extrude

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.350 
then I'm going to go through and extrude
through<00:04:27.990> all<00:04:28.460> okay<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:29.520> I've<00:04:29.730> got<00:04:29.790> one<00:04:30.030> circle

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
through all okay so I've got one circle

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.670 
through all okay so I've got one circle
there<00:04:30.480> but<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.810> need<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.140> other<00:04:31.230> three

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
there but now I need the other three

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.800 
there but now I need the other three
what<00:04:32.520> I'm<00:04:32.580> going<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:32.790> do<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> circular

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
what I'm going to do is a circular

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
what I'm going to do is a circular
pattern<00:04:34.170> around<00:04:35.570> here<00:04:36.570> I'm<00:04:36.960> on<00:04:37.200> four<00:04:37.560> holes

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
pattern around here I'm on four holes

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.460 
pattern around here I'm on four holes
around<00:04:38.220> all<00:04:38.670> 360<00:04:39.480> degrees<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.960> can<00:04:40.110> see<00:04:40.260> like

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
around all 360 degrees you can see like

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.590 
around all 360 degrees you can see like
if<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:40.980> make<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.310> six<00:04:41.640> it'll<00:04:42.060> do<00:04:42.150> six<00:04:42.420> holes

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
if I make this six it'll do six holes

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.890 
if I make this six it'll do six holes
about<00:04:42.930> all<00:04:43.590> 360<00:04:44.400> degrees<00:04:44.700> whereas<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.240> do<00:04:45.300> if<00:04:45.780> I

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
about all 360 degrees whereas I do if I

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.530 
about all 360 degrees whereas I do if I
do<00:04:45.960> Nami<00:04:46.470> degrees<00:04:46.980> then<00:04:47.640> we<00:04:47.670> put<00:04:47.970> four<00:04:48.330> whole

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
do Nami degrees then we put four whole

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.110 
do Nami degrees then we put four whole
third<00:04:48.840> four<00:04:49.320> holes<00:04:49.550> evenly<00:04:50.550> spaced<00:04:50.880> about

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
third four holes evenly spaced about

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.070 
third four holes evenly spaced about
ninety<00:04:51.630> degrees<00:04:51.920> but<00:04:52.920> I'm<00:04:53.100> up<00:04:53.280> for<00:04:53.580> about<00:04:54.090> 360

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
ninety degrees but I'm up for about 360

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.360 
ninety degrees but I'm up for about 360
and<00:04:55.260> there<00:04:56.010> we<00:04:56.070> go

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
and there we go

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.550 
and there we go
that<00:04:56.550> just<00:04:56.760> copies<00:04:57.090> up<00:04:57.210> now<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.050> reason<00:04:58.410> why<00:04:58.530> I

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
that just copies up now the reason why I

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.850 
that just copies up now the reason why I
did<00:04:58.920> this<00:04:59.040> circular<00:04:59.490> pattern<00:04:59.820> here<00:05:00.860> instead

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
did this circular pattern here instead

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.770 
did this circular pattern here instead
of<00:05:02.010> just<00:05:02.910> going<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.150> go<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.330> suppress<00:05:03.600> that

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
of just going to go and suppress that

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.420 
of just going to go and suppress that
instead<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.260> here<00:05:04.500> on<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.770> sketch<00:05:05.070> is

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
instead of here on this sketch is

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.910 
instead of here on this sketch is
because<00:05:05.910> well<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.750> does<00:05:06.990> accomplish<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.740> same

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
because well it does accomplish the same

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.090 
because well it does accomplish the same
thing<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:09.900> fact<00:05:10.110> I've<00:05:10.290> pretty<00:05:10.590> much<00:05:10.680> got<00:05:10.980> the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
thing in fact I've pretty much got the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.490 
thing in fact I've pretty much got the
exact<00:05:11.340> same<00:05:11.370> little<00:05:11.850> box<00:05:12.060> here<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:15.350> that<00:05:16.350> can

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
exact same little box here and that can

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.280 
exact same little box here and that can
go<00:05:16.650> through<00:05:17.000> edit<00:05:18.000> this<00:05:18.120> feature<00:05:18.420> to<00:05:19.110> select

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
go through edit this feature to select

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.130 
go through edit this feature to select
these<00:05:19.590> holes<00:05:19.860> being<00:05:20.190> extruded<00:05:20.700> as<00:05:21.000> well<00:05:21.180> well

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
these holes being extruded as well well

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.200 
these holes being extruded as well well
is<00:05:22.680> straight<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.220> does<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.640> same<00:05:23.820> thing<00:05:24.060> and

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
is straight and does the same thing and

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.880 
is straight and does the same thing and
I<00:05:24.450> don't<00:05:24.630> have<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:25.350> have<00:05:25.440> another<00:05:25.470> feature

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
I don't have to have another feature

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.370 
I don't have to have another feature
here<00:05:26.160> it's<00:05:26.400> much<00:05:27.120> harder<00:05:27.390> to<00:05:27.660> go<00:05:27.810> through<00:05:28.050> and

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
here it's much harder to go through and

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.200 
here it's much harder to go through and
edit<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:28.860> as<00:05:29.370> you<00:05:29.520> can<00:05:29.610> see<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:29.850> can't

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
edit this as you can see I can't

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.890 
edit this as you can see I can't
actually<00:05:30.480> edit<00:05:30.980> that<00:05:31.980> and<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:33.120> can't<00:05:33.420> edit<00:05:33.600> how

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
actually edit that and I can't edit how

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.300 
actually edit that and I can't edit how
many<00:05:34.080> holes<00:05:34.320> are<00:05:34.500> here<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:34.920> I'm<00:05:35.040> just<00:05:35.070> gonna

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
many holes are here so I'm just gonna

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.170 
many holes are here so I'm just gonna
control<00:05:36.090> Z<00:05:36.510> through<00:05:36.780> all<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.940> because<00:05:38.940> if

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
control Z through all of this because if

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.950 
control Z through all of this because if
I<00:05:39.330> do<00:05:39.390> it<00:05:40.100> here<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.400> its<00:05:42.210> own<00:05:42.330> separate<00:05:42.660> feature

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
I do it here as its own separate feature

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.620 
I do it here as its own separate feature
then<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.230> can<00:05:43.470> go<00:05:43.590> through<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.550> edit<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:45.180> can<00:05:45.540> go

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
then I can go through and edit I can go

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.210 
then I can go through and edit I can go
through<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:45.960> say<00:05:46.080> okay<00:05:46.170> actually<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:46.710> want<00:05:46.950> six

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
through and say okay actually I want six

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.600 
through and say okay actually I want six
or<00:05:47.670> actually<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.690> want<00:05:49.050> them<00:05:49.470> only<00:05:49.950> about<00:05:50.190> half

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
or actually I want them only about half

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.150 
or actually I want them only about half
a<00:05:50.760> circle<00:05:51.120> or<00:05:51.240> hundred<00:05:51.690> eighty<00:05:51.870> degrees<00:05:52.230> so

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
a circle or hundred eighty degrees so

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.630 
a circle or hundred eighty degrees so
that's<00:05:53.940> why<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.180> prefer<00:05:54.420> to<00:05:54.570> do<00:05:55.100> features<00:05:56.100> under

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
that's why I prefer to do features under

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.250 
that's why I prefer to do features under
patterns<00:05:57.000> it's<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> same<00:05:57.570> thing<00:05:57.750> with<00:05:58.170> the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
patterns it's the same thing with the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.890 
patterns it's the same thing with the
rectangular<00:05:58.770> pattern<00:05:59.160> by<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.370> way<00:05:59.780> but<00:06:00.780> I'm

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
rectangular pattern by the way but I'm

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.420 
rectangular pattern by the way but I'm
just<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.290> showed<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.740> how<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:01.920> do<00:06:02.040> those<00:06:02.220> holes

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
just I showed you how to do those holes

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.480 
just I showed you how to do those holes
in<00:06:02.640> three<00:06:02.880> different<00:06:03.060> ways<00:06:03.830> by<00:06:04.830> doing<00:06:05.100> points

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
in three different ways by doing points

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.240 
in three different ways by doing points
and<00:06:05.670> then<00:06:05.790> the<00:06:06.060> whole<00:06:06.210> function<00:06:06.980> just<00:06:07.980> an

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
and then the whole function just an

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.840 
and then the whole function just an
extrusion<00:06:08.670> and<00:06:09.060> then<00:06:09.180> extrusion<00:06:09.780> with<00:06:09.960> the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
extrusion and then extrusion with the

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.820 
extrusion and then extrusion with the
pattern<00:06:11.850> so<00:06:12.630> that's<00:06:12.840> it<00:06:12.990> for<00:06:13.200> this<00:06:13.260> video<00:06:13.440> and

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
pattern so that's it for this video and

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.260 
pattern so that's it for this video and
the<00:06:13.980> next<00:06:14.010> video<00:06:14.490> I'm<00:06:14.760> going<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:14.940> go<00:06:15.030> on<00:06:15.150> to

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
the next video I'm going to go on to

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.650 
the next video I'm going to go on to
doing<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.630> disc<00:06:15.870> Oh

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.190 

also<00:06:19.530> don't<00:06:20.310> forget<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.760> save<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.510> use<00:06:21.840> nice

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
also don't forget to save and use nice

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.200 
also don't forget to save and use nice
naming<00:06:22.980> conventions<00:06:25.610> naming<00:06:26.610> conventions

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
naming conventions naming conventions

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.540 
naming conventions naming conventions
are<00:06:27.510> less<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:29.520> that's<00:06:29.850> it<00:06:30.030> this<00:06:30.240> video
