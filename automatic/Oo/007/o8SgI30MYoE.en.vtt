00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.180
 good what is happening then nothing here 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.550
 I'm already the same since I feel 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.170
 like an eagle uncle you know why 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.570
 the world can feel like an eagle 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.860
 because we say that I am the leader 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:20.170
 all stores if you do not yet 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:22.380
 in the group so because this is a 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.380
 threw 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.540
 a parachute a used compress 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.380
 why because this video we are going to do 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.829
 a test can be careful with the 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.820
 speed 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.820
 Wait no 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.140
 no it's not like that we're also going to make a 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 test of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.850
 We are not going to prove it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.690
 in the latter of 1.17 and well then this 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.890
 is your right guy put a helmet that 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.750
 You have to take it there because it's called a helmet 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.790
 bulletproof and the most bulletproof then 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.350
 there are many people who have told me dani and 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.180
 if it's called bulletproof it's supposed to have 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.740
 to be resistant to bullets then 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.920
 in this video we are going to see if really 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.240
 It is resistant to bullets if you do not know the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.950
 shoot us takes less damage 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.990
 et cetera etcetera so what do you think 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.520
 flow we are going to give him cane that seems to me 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 that is not bulletproof but we're going to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 try it we have the last one says it 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:56.590
 Daniel is off the radar 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.590
 the search police 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
 here 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.040
 put yourself first without a helmet 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.090
 do not get angry with the air, not where it is 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.590
 beating the living room 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.560
 let's do it with the gun 4 that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.430
 it's worthwhile to take off the mask you're going to see 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.959
 my real face 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.160
 I'm going to see your real face, but not later 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.490
 censorship I do something about that if I do not 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:37.070
 people then recognize me on the street 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:40.340
 down the street of the saints please 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.340
 first shot 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:49.170
 if helmet killed you from a passing shot 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.180
 Of course you had to confirm this already 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 We are here in a professional manner 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.800
 you have to confirm it suppose nothing is there 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.660
 confirm what you wanted was to kill me uncle 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.660
 and then we're going to do the test 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.880
 put on the blue blue motorcycle helmet 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.070
 helmet 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.630
 the helmet helmet 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.880
 is there perfect be behind the 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.480
 ball 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.520
 perfect agile 1 2 of 2 shots theme 2 but 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.990
 endure holds two shots to the field and the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.090
 bus I neither really knew 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.580
 able to account for the same as I do 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.510
 yes there we go let's see the bulletproof the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.700
 version about me I think it's not going to 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.470
 surprise I think we're going to die 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.390
 good if it is endured west stretch 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.650
 the other one endures two and a half man if 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.970
 they put bulletproof helmet in addition you have and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.190
 as I have it the same position has as 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.010
 I do not know how air gates and it seems 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.930
 like a hard plastic and with 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.070
 complications that I'm going to face is that 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.200
 I'm a little fat after summer 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.560
 well 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.520
 helmet accessories bulletproof helmet 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.209
 perfect that to see how much I hit you where 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.209
 be protected 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.720
 Let's go there 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.720
 about 23 and 45 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.760
 the truth that you molar this you put it 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.320
 I did not start multi-canes and you can not 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.740
 fight this helmet and that of the motorcycle like that 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.740
 they never die 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.130
 seven shots have no idea that this 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.770
 I resisted so much really that's why I think 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.430
 which is why it costs 40 thousand 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.430
 dollars not 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.270
 I honestly did not expect it 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.270
 4 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.980
 6 and 2 years dead
