 useria thank you that united kingdom mark the throat award 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.449
 2009 I'm sorry I can't be tonight 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.079
 with you 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.079
 perhaps to some extent this hour - deserved 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.160
 so long I try to spread the information knowledge 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.739
 ideas about how the world around us works 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.220
 in which large 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 engineering technology mathematical physics 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.870
 and recently I am also very moved 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.060
 to tell what I have understood in the field of economics for so many years 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.230
 currently our country in the whole world is going through a serious crisis 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.530
 economic 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.830
 and I wrote a book on the subject 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.390
 it's called patatrac 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.930
 crisis because 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.960
 and until when 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.030
 that I don't think the crisis will be short 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.170
 to get out of it and it is necessary not only to work a lot but in that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.449
 beware of those trying to profit 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.230
 of others 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.180
 and that they try to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 rob 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 the wealth that should be anyway 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 I tried to tell what the causes were 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.540
 of the current crisis 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.940
 mostly 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.560
 crazy speculations not sufficiently regulated by the law 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.440
 here the thefts undoubtedly thefts and speculations 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580
 someone 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.460
 He told me that I act like a guru like a boulud or just a teaching 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.120
 passing day 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.360
 learn at least one new thing 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.670
 if you do it, it changes your life 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.480
 and if we all did it 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.740
 we will change the world 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.730
 u the 24h never asked 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.730
 to suggest a password for 2010 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 robinson's suggested it after the study 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.760
 because the world is full of brilliant people 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.159
 who studies discovers new things 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.519
 invents 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.049
 and if every day we do not update on what they produce you should be a person 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.859

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.189
 we are passed by is more active than I try to us 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.859
 we notice 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.069
 the world does not risk because it is very personal to invent something 9 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.599
 because through the internet through the internet 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.939
 these news as soon as they come 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.919

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.059

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.359
