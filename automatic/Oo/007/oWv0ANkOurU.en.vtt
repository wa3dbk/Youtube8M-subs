00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.880
 so people there I am neither relying on Penny at CES 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.620
 now with a new video about weapons 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.170
 now it's the anvil refinement year after year people are asking when 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.979
 May I paint my weapon now 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.369
 and so on, so that such stories just once short 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.689
 to explain 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.720
 what of what you can not ask for the first question because his weapon was here I 

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.689
 never have a barrel example 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.419
 Japan is not a performance enhancing measure so why should you? 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.599
 not open Markus Katzer 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.869
 that's why I find the question open very funny is actually very much 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 important to color the weapon 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 there is nothing bad now 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.520
 you have to be careful that you have to make reasonable sense of the memo 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.440
 Technique AZT the water channel 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 has also to make videos and makes Sascha 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.580
 and therefore 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.480
 wonderful that is considerable 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.510
 Otherwise, what the attachments to stage still relative fool freedom 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 It just has to be coke 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.780
 there is an exception as lamps 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.400
 Readers and such stories I have banned this case but again 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.240
 closed Steinbach which deserves it here too 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.120
 otherwise I have already implemented what I can see you just sit the 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.310
 Shoulder Falls was another divorced couple of other states and how they rebuilt 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.650
 only the connection hit 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.720
 Another handle that formed the handle I also have from Gettorf 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400
 Features from matching gripping found 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.410
 and such stories 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.040
 the sailor because you have a lot there you have to be careful that you can do it 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.800
 Reasonably salty does have the weapon left 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.630
 normal or stork 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.409
 that's why the whole and she has the box is still the same of Badi 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.950
 is the same 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.190
 our stories and when painting you should be careful that one 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.060
 possibly not SF 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490
 over painted 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.310
 So if you have a bleak picture now that's the problem man 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.280
 you have to be careful that there is nothing on it good 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.260
 if necessary, the police that still sees at a check 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.600
 then the disadvantage of one on it is the community Elsdorf 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.530
 then you should just leave that out for a presentation 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.400
 Otherwise, there's not much to say on the subject both 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.910
 Clearly Dartmann paint 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.970
 outer change I've got in on healing I'll do it again 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.329
 do you mean 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.349
 the waterwheel of mine
