guess if I had to say it's meant me

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.889 
guess if I had to say it's meant me
doing<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.880> positive<00:02:10.090> thing

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899

doing a positive thing
it<00:02:11.620> also<00:02:11.800> means<00:02:13.200> improving<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> quality<00:02:14.470> of
