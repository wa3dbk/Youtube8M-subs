the copter a flight simulator x Bohemia
Interactive<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:09.300> actually<00:00:09.719> done<00:00:09.929> with<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
Interactive it's actually done with the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.919 
Interactive it's actually done with the
arm<00:00:10.650> engine<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.880> much<00:00:12.150> different<00:00:12.330> from

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
arm engine but it's much different from

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.289 
arm engine but it's much different from
our<00:00:13.170> map<00:00:13.349> because<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.429> focus<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:14.969> game

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
our map because the focus of this game

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.599 
our map because the focus of this game
is<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.960> flight<00:00:16.320> simulator<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.430> that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
is to be a flight simulator so that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.910 
is to be a flight simulator so that
means<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.240> render<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> huge<00:00:19.170> area<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
means that it render a huge area and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.910 
means that it render a huge area and
there's<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.939> lot<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> details<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.890> course

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
there's a lot of details but of course

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.580 
there's a lot of details but of course
that<00:00:23.189> doesn't<00:00:23.640> aim<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.240> being<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.750> detail<00:00:25.289> as<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that doesn't aim at being as detail as a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.130 
that doesn't aim at being as detail as a
first<00:00:26.010> person<00:00:26.189> shooter<00:00:26.510> but<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.660> terms<00:00:27.810> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
first person shooter but in terms of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.410 
first person shooter but in terms of
flight<00:00:28.560> simulator<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.789> compare<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
flight simulator if you compare that to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.530 
flight simulator if you compare that to
everything<00:00:30.960> else<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> domain<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:33.059> game

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
everything else in the domain this game

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.510 
everything else in the domain this game
is<00:00:33.780> pretty<00:00:34.020> much<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> best<00:00:34.739> looking<00:00:35.010> flight

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is pretty much the best looking flight

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.799 
is pretty much the best looking flight
simulator<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.239> there<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:38.280> course<00:00:38.809> that

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
simulator out there and of course that

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
simulator out there and of course that
puts<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.379> Seattle<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.430> they<00:00:42.210> recruited

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
puts you in Seattle and they recruited

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
puts you in Seattle and they recruited
Seattle<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:44.480> great<00:00:45.480> details<00:00:45.980> of<00:00:46.980> course<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Seattle in great details of course that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
Seattle in great details of course that
doesn't<00:00:48.210> mean<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> buildings<00:00:49.260> might

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
doesn't mean all the buildings might

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.639 
doesn't mean all the buildings might
look<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.190> real<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:52.079> think

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
look like the real thing but I think

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
look like the real thing but I think
they<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.610> did<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> great<00:00:54.180> job<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.690> giving

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
they really did a great job at giving

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.389 
they really did a great job at giving
you<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> feeling<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.239> Seattle<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
you the feeling that it is Seattle and

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.139 
you the feeling that it is Seattle and
actually<00:00:59.690> it's<00:01:00.690> clear<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.320> map<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
actually it's clear that the map is a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.289 
actually it's clear that the map is a
satellite<00:01:03.149> picture<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> certain<00:01:04.500> point

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
satellite picture up to a certain point

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.840 
satellite picture up to a certain point
so<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> means<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> street<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
so that means that all the street and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
so that means that all the street and
all<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.390> buildings<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> real

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
all the buildings they are like the real

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.800 
all the buildings they are like the real
thing<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.450> feel

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
thing so as you can see you really feel

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
thing so as you can see you really feel
like<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.380> seattle<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:18.090> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
like you're in seattle and this is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.770 
like you're in seattle and this is
pretty<00:01:18.930> much<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:20.100> most<00:01:20.700> impressive<00:01:21.060> game<00:01:21.540> on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
pretty much the most impressive game on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
pretty much the most impressive game on
that<00:01:21.990> aspect<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.799> ever<00:01:23.130> saw<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:26.060> it's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that aspect that I ever saw because it's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.240 
that aspect that I ever saw because it's
just<00:01:27.360> amazing<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.380> fly<00:01:28.799> through<00:01:29.869> buildings

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
just amazing to fly through buildings

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.300 
just amazing to fly through buildings
skyscraper<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:33.659> acrobatic<00:01:34.320> stuff<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
skyscraper and do acrobatic stuff in

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.999 
skyscraper and do acrobatic stuff in
that<00:01:35.369> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> environment<00:01:36.650> it's<00:01:37.650> much

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that kind of environment it's much

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.300 
that kind of environment it's much
cooler<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:39.079> most<00:01:40.079> flight<00:01:40.470> sim<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.100> in

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
cooler than most flight sim because in

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
cooler than most flight sim because in
most<00:01:41.430> flights<00:01:41.790> him<00:01:42.119> only<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.990> few<00:01:43.470> major

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
most flights him only a few major

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.550 
most flights him only a few major
buildings<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.640> rendered<00:01:45.030> usually<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
buildings are rendered usually and it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
buildings are rendered usually and it's
really<00:01:46.799> rare<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.700> actually<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
really rare that you actually have that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.319 
really rare that you actually have that
amount<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.200> buildings<00:01:49.710> rendered<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
amount of buildings rendered so this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.240 
amount of buildings rendered so this
game<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:51.899> does<00:01:52.409> push<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> flight

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
game really does push the flight

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.810 
game really does push the flight
simulator<00:01:53.520> gender<00:01:54.390> further<00:01:55.280> with<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> great

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
simulator gender further with the great

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.270 
simulator gender further with the great
length<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.390> details<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.070> really

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
length of details and this is really

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.440 
length of details and this is really
awesome<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.469> showing<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:02.009> this

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
awesome so what I'm showing in this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.929 
awesome so what I'm showing in this
mission<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.960> time<00:02:04.200> trial<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.189> goal

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
mission it's a time trial and the goal

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.820 
mission it's a time trial and the goal
is<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.390> reach<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.920> end

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
is to reach the end

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.150 
is to reach the end
in<00:02:09.390> less<00:02:10.390> than<00:02:10.570> two<00:02:10.840> minutes<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.590> get<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.950> gold

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
in less than two minutes to get the gold

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.360 
in less than two minutes to get the gold
score<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:13.960> that<00:02:14.590> create

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
score and as you can see that create

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.790 
score and as you can see that create
many<00:02:15.970> challenging<00:02:16.720> Pat<00:02:16.960> then<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.590> lot<00:02:17.620> of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.130 
many challenging Pat then it's a lot of
fun<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:19.060> end<00:02:19.210> up<00:02:19.300> competing<00:02:19.780> with

yourself<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.950> I'll<00:02:21.070> make<00:02:21.310> more<00:02:21.520> videos<00:02:21.880> of

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
yourself so I'll make more videos of

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.390

this game because I think this is a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.050 
this game because I think this is a
pretty<00:02:24.670> unusual<00:02:24.940> game<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.530> think<00:02:27.060> it's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
pretty unusual game and I think it's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.320 
pretty unusual game and I think it's
