00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.730
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.340
 video of latin gamers today 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.769
 we bring you a top five with those games 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.810
 that defy logic or nature 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.759
 nor the physics take place in this top in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.009
 position number 5 is located 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.619
 minecraft that popular game 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.769
 independent having anything but 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.109
 logic and the laws of physics by 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.179
 example we installed a tree this is not 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.739
 falls but is suspended in the air 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.380
 until its regeneration 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.620
 defying completely our law of 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.530
 gravity 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.930
 or there's no wine a zombie and now what 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.449
 we make the best solution according to the game 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.969
 is to dig a hole and not get out of there until 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.800
 Let the sun come up hopefully and that's that easy 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.020
 get away from the problems in the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.120
 real life 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.460
 in the fourth place we have the saga 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.340
 bioshock and is that the three games of the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.310
 saga are also a total challenge to the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.020
 logic especially the city is columbia 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.320
 and rap south since both were 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.990
 built at the end of the 19th century the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.300
 two are the perfect mix between science 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.920
 and engineering but the fact is that today 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.500
 in day and with all the technology that 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.050
 we have not yet been able to 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.360
 build an underwater city or a 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.610
 floating city another of the things that 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.890
 they defy logic are the tears of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.470
 Elisabeth and travel between realities 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.020
 different all this is also based 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.509
 in scientific principles 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.979
 specifically in quantum physics 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.020
 However, to date it has not been 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.869
 could check if all that we see 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.730
 In Baix Jokin, it can be done in the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.190
 real life 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.590
 gta san andreas is one of those games 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.140
 who has been able to entertain us for days 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.230
 and days and it's not at all a secret that 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.060
 be a total challenge to the logic how is 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.460
 possible that a car explodes hitting it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.720
 with a bouquet of flowers and how can you 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.000
 to become the most wanted terrorist 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.130
 of the world and in case of being caught 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.560
 to be able to leave with a bribe of 300 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.660
 clear dollars that are several of those 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.910
 challenges to logic those that made 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.830
 the game was even more entertaining and it's 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.840
 that's why he keeps the third place 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.450
 of our top 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.120
 in second place we have an age of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.300
 empires 2 is the strategy game that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.640
 it was the childhood of many of us in 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.940
 we could find such normal things 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.220
 as villagers walking shirtless despite 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.739
 to be in Scandinavia in winter and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.200
 covered by snow capable crops 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.840
 to resist the drought of the deserts or 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.970
 Romans and Chinese having a battle in 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.549
 North America these are some of the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.290
 more highlights without counting the famous how 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.390
 do you can not is only 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.000
 or that little monkey capable of tearing down 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.550
 any building with only two hits 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.680
 if you thought case of empires 2 he deserved 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.170
 the first place we have one of the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.020
 most challenging games of all 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.780
 garries mode if you know how to play 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.090
 you install the correct mods you can do 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.730
 whatever you want to add to the characters 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.670
 that you want to make those who walk float 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.230
 to crawl or whatever you can think of 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.340
 reason why it occupies the first place 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.319
 of this top 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.300
