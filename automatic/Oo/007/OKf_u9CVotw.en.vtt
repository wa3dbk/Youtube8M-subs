packaging<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.680> also<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.970> cracked<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.990> little

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
packaging and also I cracked it a little

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.260 
packaging and also I cracked it a little
bit<00:03:47.440> because<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.830> dropped<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.250> on<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.490> floor<00:03:48.730> a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
bit because I dropped it on the floor a

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.390 
bit because I dropped it on the floor a
couple<00:03:49.330> of<00:03:49.810> times<00:03:49.990> but<00:03:50.530> as<00:03:50.710> you<00:03:50.830> can<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.100> here

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
couple of times but as you can see here

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.550 
couple of times but as you can see here
or<00:03:51.550> maybe<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.000> can't<00:03:52.270> there<00:03:52.990> is<00:03:53.110> some<00:03:53.350> tape

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
or maybe you can't there is some tape

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.860 
or maybe you can't there is some tape
here<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.010> hold<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.730> container<00:03:55.480> together

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
here to hold the container together

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.620 
here to hold the container together
because<00:03:56.460> it's<00:03:57.460> definitely<00:03:57.610> on<00:03:57.940> its<00:03:57.970> last<00:03:58.330> leg

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
because it's definitely on its last leg

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.390 
because it's definitely on its last leg
