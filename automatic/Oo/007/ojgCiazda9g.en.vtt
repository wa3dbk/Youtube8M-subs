00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.649
 and Hello to you as it has always Harn 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.969
 rubric play like where we are on an example 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.070
 professional players 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.670
 find the most profitable strategy in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.500
 this or that pub situation in this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 issue we look at not quite 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.620
 standard array and under control 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.620
 ferrari is magic 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.329
 offices came to mid trying to farm 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 creeps here and sam makes fb 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.109
 and here already bears the bot like 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 nothing unusual everything within 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.040
 reasonable but not here it was next 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.710
 items in the inventory weiss and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.869
 Meke appears possible to some people 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.799
 see mecca on iset usual thing but 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.280
 This kind of antics I see for the first time and all 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.869
 nothing but mika really saves with epo 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.759
 besides the fact that if it makes a good 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 damage from hand and takes some 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.470
 amount of armor of enemies he now also 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.229
 heal allies moreover he himself 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.570
 did you buy wards for mid support 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.409
 no thank god today we won't see 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.409
 support asfn 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.210
 from the game ferrari can distinguish what he 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.079
 always find a place to farm whether 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 forest mobs 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.310
 or creeps on the line while not forgetting 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.079
 about gangs which by the way is not rare 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.079
 send enemies to guard the hangar 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.760
 thanks to successful gangs ice workshops 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.390
 habitual for all of us appears 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.980
 Items like Votar and BKB 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 ferrari moving almost across 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.590
 card destroys one by one all 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.960
 mobs 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.000
 he pulls and shoots the line and takes 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 participation in all sites and accordingly 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.820
 gets huge luggage of money in the end 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.890
 the game was not the most difficult 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.890
 quite unusual let's let you down 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.690
 a brief summary first of all wanted 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.180
 to say what to experiment it 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 certainly not always good but sometimes 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.830
 bring gifts more good than you 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.660
 expected also very important to keep an eye on 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.110
 farm while you need to try to help 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.910
 allies on other lines 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 your forest or your opponents forest 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.240
 always open to farming therefore 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.020
 try to farm wherever only 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.700
 can i think this all bring my 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.709
 apologies for such a short release 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.870
 I think soon everything will be on 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.190
 My places but while I say goodbye to you 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.190
 see you bye 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.700
 five
