00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.300
 hello good to all and if com before people 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.340
 I want to show you a possible clue 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.099
 about black ops 3 about the story and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.529
 the future of black OPS 3 Look here 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.869
 transit we remember that in the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.689
 start when we started there was a 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.250
 series of zombies that were different 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.080
 they were zombies that came from a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.850
 madhouse that's why there was one here behind 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.850
 what is this that I am seeing right now 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.220
 that I had the straitjacket we saw 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.980
 that came from an asylum but there was 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.799
 another series of different zombies that 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.250
 they came from a kind of sanatorium and they are 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:56.150
 these that have these species of 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.140
 of the nightgown is of pajamas that are of that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.930
 site of that sanatorium apart from the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.269
 Asylum that might be that same 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.180
 site is the asylum outside that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.090
 sanatorium that was here near the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.369
 this place of transit because there they could 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.130
 be experimenting with your subjects of 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.869
 try quietly in that kind of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.060
 sanatorium because there they could be 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.250
 perfectly hidden without anyone 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.640
 I saw how they experimented with those 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 people these these zombies those who 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.960
 they have pajamas these have something more 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.890
 which is very curious and that gives another clue 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.760
 about what are fixed test subjects 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.820
 they have 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 those bracelets that you are seeing there 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.860
 plastic bracelets that have a color 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.130
 yellow but that's these two because 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.010
 the back has the color bracelet 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.680
 green is how different are they are not 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.820
 different zombies among them despite 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.010
 that we do not see the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.160
 difference not but because they were 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.250
 different is that they had made different 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.290
 tests with each other and something and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 some had one thing and others had 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.530
 other than at first glance because we do not 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.620
 we can see but if you see in that DNA 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.350
 notice that it looks perfectly that you have 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.290
 those bracelets and those bracelets have a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.770
 bar code those bar codes 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.040
 could they give us if we could have a 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.800
 reader not that of the key to all that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.489
 not because we would have those wristbands 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.680
 the dolls but these are seen to be 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.750
 test subjects who were in 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.600
 that sanatorium but there's something else 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.120
 you still remember that I took some 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.209
 necklaces that were seen in some zombies 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.600
 in some kind of zombies and those necklaces 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.300
 they were metallic and they had a mark for 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.790
 behind right now here in this one does not look 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.910
 but 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.270
 in this other one it may be better 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.610
 look at that brand you have is like a 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.670
 pyramid but upside down already teaches it in 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.900
 your day could be handling these 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.590
 zombies through those plates those those 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.290
 metallic iron necklaces and in addition 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.319
 see what a coincidence that those who 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.170
 They are the toilets of that place 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.840
 those people who worked there in that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.620
 place in that sanatorium 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.819
 in that madhouse that place where the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.329
 doctor come out or whoever it was 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 I would be experimenting with these beings 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.280
 before humans 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.030
 give the ex her videos and even the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.030
 next video
