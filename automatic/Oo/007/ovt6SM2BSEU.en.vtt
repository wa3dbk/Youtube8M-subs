Ronaldo the Madrid fans aren't really
behind<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:13.799> expect<00:01:14.040> them<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
behind in like you would expect them to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
behind in like you would expect them to
be<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.240> probably<00:01:15.630> getting<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> bit

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
be and it's probably getting a bit

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
be and it's probably getting a bit
frustrating<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.560> him<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
frustrating for him out there so the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749 
frustrating for him out there so the
question<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.470> let<00:01:20.340> David

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
question is this would you let David

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.200
