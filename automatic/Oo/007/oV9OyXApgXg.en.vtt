00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
that they have gone through here is that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:15.190 
that they have gone through here is that
a<00:02:58.920> road<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.690> heck<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:04.280> ooh<00:03:10.340> got<00:03:11.340> one<00:03:12.380> I
