00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.089
 me and with sales michael with you and today we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.980
 let's be very close 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.990
 In general, I want to answer the question 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.059
 as close as we can 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.280
 get to other objects and other 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.890
 people and maybe it sounds like 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.650
 simple question but if we don't go up 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 of his atoms he is quite complex and may 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.769
 make you feel a little 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.560
 lonely when i make my fingers in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.760
 in all respects I touch that one on 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 atomic level 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.370
 no and in fact if there are 0 ahead of us and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.969
 right now your body matter from 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.050
 technically not touching reported you 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.489
 Generally the place of this you hover over 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 dandelion good small little 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 gap size 100 mb 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.800
 she is so small but what we don't 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.860
 we can see her, but there is also 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.320
 caused by the fact that your ass and here we are 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.059
 made of atoms before you thought and know 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.480
 that matter with which we interact 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.879
 every day are made of atoms before the core of the wasps 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 surrounded electron shells on his 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.520
 orbits approaching each other they don't 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 form a bond or chemical reaction and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 hug problem touching each other 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.900
 why because he and his friend are from 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 getting them the same charge 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.409
 and because of the cool stuff called kruzak 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.520
 saully 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.500
 we with dc electrons in atoms can 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
 snatched on the same level in one 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 energy shell this means that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.360
 if i touch there is no 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.170
 technically I don't really touch it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.150
 atom i depict it pretty close together 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 elixir and large debts to his wife between 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.829
 by electrons and speaks at length 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.079
 negligee well of course the nerves in my skin 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.119
 may feel this repulsive force 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.250
 this is what i call sensation and 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.590
 The object's window jabs are already bigger 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.540
 efforts of course I can hack or right 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 music or cut something by but 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.399
 embraced to not touch any family 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.060
 matter just live and took off her ways 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.219
 using neutron pushing and even 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.750
 although you can easily cut things 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.540
 with scissors for so often they card us 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.550
 here it would be catching up depression builds 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.190
 does that mean when you kiss your girl 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.800
 or pet the dog or hug your 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.140
 granny in fact you do not realize 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.750
 contact mr matter 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.240
 technically you don't touch of course 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.959
 just feel the power pushing two 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:35.540
 of electrons can their hope 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.720
 area we ask ourselves south what we can 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.140
 do to affect the windrose numbers 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.970
 on the self can we do it and you 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.190
 need to be a little radioactive 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 if you want to do both parts 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.800
 people quite a bit and radioactive 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 and practically from lego city in bed with 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.370
 another person throughout the year and 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.200
 respect and she exposed 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 radioactive radiation on one 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.840
 mellerud more than the village of the one who sleeps 1 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.520
 but we are talking about a very small 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.230
 the amount of radiation that is actually 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.940
 really does not affect your body at all but 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.450
 Still, it is but how it is to us 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.630
 hit 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.750
 but this is carbon-14 airy harry 40 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.500
 late on it so gift high 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.360
 potassium content virtually any wrong 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.239
 like the brazilian river volga radioactive 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.019
 After all this map Paris insistence Tamerlan 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.880
 the ground every fight crunching the forces of the Muscovites 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.670
 is a radioactive isotope 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.400
 in feces actually it was kelly 600 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.310
 bananas you would get as much radio 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.130
 for both from chest x-ray 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.900
 hunter bend jai a little active 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.880
 Does this mean that if I wash at 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.130
 someone pressed cleaning that 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.890
 some radioactive lachi prokinut 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.820
 my body and hand accounting making absorbed 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.980
 coffin come on here 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.360
 a flock and then we finally can 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.600
 say what we really what 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.640
 touched the length of the mental level 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.070
 there may be radiation coming from 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.049
 we are very unlikely to reach 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.760
 atoms of another person offended as in 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.580
 the human body contains to large 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.340
 radio numbers 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.960
 his material is energy accumulated and then 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.910
 you don't really know what it is 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.880
 happens and as i said something 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.549
 happen very small what is most to be 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.400
 we should go back a little 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.140
 talk chemical reactions this is when 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.930
 I mentioned that thereâ€™s a problem 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.790
 touches but they are a little friendly COX 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.590
 when they get together and know 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.590
 share electrons and such a phenomenon 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.690
 I always get into hostility 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.790
 chemically react food eating myself 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.000
 nutrients getting rid of that 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.900
 what I don't need but to be cannibal 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.610
 and here is something hand or be a zombie 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.640
 how can i be she chemical i 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.290
 mummy he is up close to the man that too 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.780
 you happiness hands it is such a thing 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.600
 called birth when you grow up 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.190
 inside your mother for your parents 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 chemically interacts to create 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.320
 until the inhabitants behind the electrons it seems 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.840
 we at least very similar to that in 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.430
 this case, your parents and your children and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.890
 The only people that you definitely have 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.780
 you know that's the closest book 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.040
 really touched 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.520
 and it is touching and thanks as always 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.520
 for watching
