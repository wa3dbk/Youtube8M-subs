it's<00:06:08.610> just<00:06:08.789> a<00:06:08.879> ghost<00:06:09.090> story<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:10.020> which<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.289> don't

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
it's just a ghost story to which I don't

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.589 
it's just a ghost story to which I don't
believe<00:06:10.710> in<00:06:10.919> overall<00:06:11.610> it's<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:12.090> very<00:06:12.120> effective

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
believe in overall it's a very effective

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.140 
believe in overall it's a very effective
story<00:06:13.110> but<00:06:13.860> it's<00:06:14.009> staying<00:06:14.280> power<00:06:14.490> may<00:06:14.819> vary

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
story but it's staying power may vary

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.909 
story but it's staying power may vary
for<00:06:15.419> some<00:06:15.690> more<00:06:15.930> than<00:06:15.960> others<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.500> guess<00:06:16.530> that's

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
for some more than others I guess that's

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.469 
for some more than others I guess that's
