00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
thirty dollars so yeah considering how

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.190 
thirty dollars so yeah considering how
much<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.380> worth<00:01:23.390> I'd<00:01:24.390> say<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> good

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
much it's worth I'd say that was a good

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.760 
much it's worth I'd say that was a good
bargain<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.280> thing<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.670> makes<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.180> um

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
bargain and the thing that makes it um

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.480 
bargain and the thing that makes it um
that<00:01:28.770> apparently<00:01:29.430> worth<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.119> much<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
that apparently worth that much is that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.240 
that apparently worth that much is that
sourav<00:01:32.490> ski<00:01:32.790> crystals<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.600> glass<00:01:34.049> cut<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
sourav ski crystals are glass cut and so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.630 
sourav ski crystals are glass cut and so
they<00:01:35.430> turn<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.979> more<00:01:37.979> expensive<00:01:38.220> than

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
they turn out to be more expensive than

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.719 
they turn out to be more expensive than
you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> regular<00:01:39.990> plastic<00:01:40.259> rhinestones<00:01:41.100> etc
