levels because i had some issues with my
recording<00:00:44.579> file<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.390> i<00:00:45.750> came<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.950> i<00:00:47.070> got

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
recording file so i came here and i got

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.920 
recording file so i came here and i got
Luigi<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.660> said<00:00:48.899> sure<00:00:49.170> let's<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.930> why

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
Luigi and I said sure let's do it why

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.010 
Luigi and I said sure let's do it why
not<00:00:52.219> let's<00:00:53.219> change<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
not let's change it up a little bit so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
not let's change it up a little bit so
and<00:00:55.820> actually<00:00:56.820> having<00:00:57.600> played<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> with

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and actually having played this with

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.119 
and actually having played this with
both<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.949> actually

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
both of them and this was actually

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
both of them and this was actually
easier<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> Luigi<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.660> he's<00:01:00.809> faster

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
easier with Luigi because he's faster

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.380 
easier with Luigi because he's faster
and<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:02.129> easier<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.640> catch<00:01:02.820> head<00:01:03.059> start

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and it's easier to catch head start

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.569 
and it's easier to catch head start
bunny<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.729> that's<00:01:05.729> actually<00:01:06.060> pretty<00:01:06.210> cool

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.940 

so<00:01:09.579> yeah<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:09.969> level<00:01:10.299> god<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.509> just<00:01:10.859> starts<00:01:11.859> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
so yeah this level god I just starts the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.969
