reasons<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.879> can<00:02:08.060> find<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.310> move

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
reasons you can find for that a move

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.330 
reasons you can find for that a move
strong<00:02:11.360> probably<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.110> stronger<00:02:12.620> move<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.069> is

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.710 

okay<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.150> once<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:22.090> thought<00:02:23.090> about<00:02:23.120> our

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
okay so once we have thought about our

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.930 
okay so once we have thought about our
opponents<00:02:23.930> move<00:02:24.349> now<00:02:25.040> let's<00:02:25.550> say<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:25.790> found

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
opponents move now let's say we found

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.009 
opponents move now let's say we found
our<00:02:26.209> move<00:02:27.250> then<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.730> thing<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.599> want<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
our move then the thing is you want to

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.580 
our move then the thing is you want to
see<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.890> move<00:02:31.069> there

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.650 

so<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.220> can<00:02:34.370> imagine<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.849> night<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.390> their

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so you can imagine that night in their

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.170 
so you can imagine that night in their
play<00:02:35.959> now<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:37.310> we're<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.489> saying<00:02:37.849> this

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
play now and we're just saying this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.920 
play now and we're just saying this
should<00:02:39.110> say<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.349> example<00:02:40.099> that<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.599> might<00:02:41.780> not

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
should say for example that it might not

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.890 
should say for example that it might not
be<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.410> simple<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:44.060> easy<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.630> can<00:02:44.750> just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
be so simple and easy that you can just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.479 
be so simple and easy that you can just
defend<00:02:45.230> apartment<00:02:45.739> let's<00:02:46.040> say<00:02:50.500> v4<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.190> now

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
defend apartment let's say v4 so now

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.720 
defend apartment let's say v4 so now
when<00:02:52.730> we<00:02:52.760> go<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.000> defend<00:02:53.540> our<00:02:53.780> pawn<00:02:54.080> here<00:02:54.730> we

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
when we go to defend our pawn here we

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.220 
when we go to defend our pawn here we
have<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.000> imagine<00:02:56.180> okay<00:02:56.630> let's<00:02:56.870> say<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:56.989> play

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
have to imagine okay let's say we play

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.830 
have to imagine okay let's say we play
Knight<00:02:57.470> c3<00:02:57.880> okay<00:02:58.880> just<00:02:59.209> imagine<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.660> night

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
Knight c3 okay just imagine the night

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.660 
Knight c3 okay just imagine the night
there<00:03:00.050> with<00:03:00.140> your<00:03:00.260> mind<00:03:00.440> that's<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.920> thing

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
there with your mind that's the thing

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.940 
there with your mind that's the thing
you'll<00:03:01.819> learn<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.269> in<00:03:02.420> chess<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.050> it's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
you'll learn to do in chess and it's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.770 
you'll learn to do in chess and it's
very<00:03:04.250> useful<00:03:04.459> okay<00:03:05.300> well<00:03:05.450> if<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.569> put<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
very useful okay well if we put the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.259 
very useful okay well if we put the
knight<00:03:05.930> on<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.200> c3<00:03:06.739> we<00:03:07.340> see<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> black

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
knight on to c3 we see that the black

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.120 
knight on to c3 we see that the black
bishop<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:09.049> actually<00:03:09.319> just<00:03:09.470> capture<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
bishop can actually just capture the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.699 
bishop can actually just capture the
piece<00:03:10.450> now<00:03:11.450> we're<00:03:11.989> gonna<00:03:12.110> go<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.260> capture<00:03:12.620> that

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
piece now we're gonna go to capture that

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.070 
piece now we're gonna go to capture that
piece<00:03:12.950> back<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:14.299> what's<00:03:14.450> black<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.900> plate

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
piece back but what's black in a plate

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.350 
piece back but what's black in a plate
next<00:03:15.340> Mike's<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:16.489> gonna<00:03:16.700> take<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.209> white

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
next Mike's just gonna take the white

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.080 
next Mike's just gonna take the white
pawn<00:03:17.660> because<00:03:18.500> he<00:03:19.099> removed<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.580> defender<00:03:20.030> of

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
pawn because he removed the defender of

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.120 
pawn because he removed the defender of
the<00:03:20.180> pawn<00:03:20.470> did<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.560> see<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.780> case

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
the pawn did we see that so in this case

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.710 
the pawn did we see that so in this case
playing<00:03:25.130> Knight<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.090> c3

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
playing Knight to c3

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.039 
playing Knight to c3
wasn't<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> very<00:03:27.709> good<00:03:27.799> idea<00:03:28.069> because<00:03:29.049> the

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
wasn't a very good idea because the

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.580 
wasn't a very good idea because the
black<00:03:30.500> Bishop<00:03:30.920> was<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.340> b4<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:33.410> have<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
black Bishop was on b4 so we have to

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.650 
black Bishop was on b4 so we have to
think<00:03:33.739> ahead<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:34.730> have<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.940> go<00:03:35.030> okay<00:03:35.269> let's<00:03:35.540> say

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
think ahead we have to go okay let's say

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.660 
think ahead we have to go okay let's say
my<00:03:35.810> Knights<00:03:36.019> there<00:03:36.230> well<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:37.069> pretty<00:03:37.340> clear

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
my Knights there well it's pretty clear

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.039 
my Knights there well it's pretty clear
as<00:03:37.790> soon<00:03:37.850> as<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.120> imagine<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.600> night<00:03:38.780> they're

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
as soon as you imagine the night they're

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.020 
as soon as you imagine the night they're
just<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.799> your<00:03:39.890> mind<00:03:40.100> without<00:03:40.459> touching<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
just in your mind without touching the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.880 
just in your mind without touching the
actual<00:03:41.359> piece<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.320> could<00:03:42.410> take<00:03:42.620> that

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
actual piece that you could take that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.620 
actual piece that you could take that
piece<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.430> we're<00:03:43.730> no<00:03:43.850> longer<00:03:43.970> defending<00:03:44.540> me

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
piece and we're no longer defending me

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.210 
piece and we're no longer defending me
for

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.490 

so<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.030> would<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.210> a<00:03:51.240> better<00:03:51.420> move<00:03:51.720> well<00:03:52.080> how

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
so it would be a better move well how

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.370 
so it would be a better move well how
about<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.770> play<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.880> move<00:03:54.150> does<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.170> move

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
about we play this move does this move

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.880 
about we play this move does this move
work<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:56.550> might<00:03:57.180> defend<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> pawn<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.650> this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
work it might defend the pawn but this

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.710 
work it might defend the pawn but this
is<00:03:59.010> actually<00:03:59.190> an<00:03:59.430> illegal<00:03:59.970> move<00:04:00.150> because

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
is actually an illegal move because

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.150 
is actually an illegal move because
we're<00:04:00.900> actually<00:04:00.990> putting<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.470> King<00:04:01.710> into

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
we're actually putting the King into

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.040 
we're actually putting the King into
check<00:04:02.210> so<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.240> room<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.630> not<00:04:03.720> gonna<00:04:03.870> work

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
check so that room is not gonna work

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.930 
check so that room is not gonna work
either<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:05.340> really<00:04:05.580> want<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> think

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
either and you really want to think

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.510 
either and you really want to think
about<00:04:06.120> these<00:04:06.390> things<00:04:06.660> beforehand<00:04:07.400> again<00:04:08.400> you

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
about these things beforehand again you

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.420 
about these things beforehand again you
might<00:04:08.730> end<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.180> losing<00:04:09.420> let's<00:04:10.200> say<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:11.160> Queen

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
might end up losing let's say the Queen

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.450 
might end up losing let's say the Queen
we're<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:11.880> instead<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.570> if<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.710> say

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
we're here instead and if you just say

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.699 
we're here instead and if you just say
oh<00:04:14.490> he's<00:04:14.790> attacking<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.360> pawn<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.930> quickly

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
oh he's attacking that pawn and quickly

to help simplify it to make it easier to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.710

find<00:05:04.410> good<00:05:04.650> moves<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.340> what<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.390> think<00:05:06.540> about

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
find good moves and what to think about

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.510 
find good moves and what to think about
along<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.230> way<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.100> still<00:05:08.370> need<00:05:08.460> to

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
along the way but you still need to

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.580 
along the way but you still need to
allow<00:05:08.700> yourself<00:05:08.820> time<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> rule<00:05:10.140> I<00:05:10.169> give

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
allow yourself time so the rule I give

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
is to take at least fifteen seconds

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.900 
is to take at least fifteen seconds
before<00:05:15.660> making<00:05:16.110> each<00:05:16.290> move<00:05:16.650> 15<00:05:17.400> seconds

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
before making each move 15 seconds

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.700 
before making each move 15 seconds
that's<00:05:18.750> gives<00:05:19.140> you<00:05:19.230> some<00:05:19.380> time<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.590> think

that's gives you some time to think

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.580 
that's gives you some time to think
about<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.850> think<00:05:21.810> about<00:05:21.990> your<00:05:22.140> opponent's

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
about it to think about your opponent's

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.700

move<00:05:23.340> first<00:05:23.790> and<00:05:24.150> start<00:05:24.870> thinking<00:05:25.080> about<00:05:25.290> well

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
move first and start thinking about well

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.240 
move first and start thinking about well
as<00:05:25.919> my<00:05:26.100> move<00:05:26.310> here<00:05:26.550> very<00:05:26.790> good<00:05:26.820> or<00:05:27.480> is<00:05:28.320> that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
legal move it gives you time to think

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.659 
legal move it gives you time to think
about<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.680> moves<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.250> can<00:05:32.400> find

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669
