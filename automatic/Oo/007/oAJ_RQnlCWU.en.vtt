from<00:01:09.080> her<00:01:09.229> today<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.490> skirt<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.060> a

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
from her today and then this skirt is a

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.050 
from her today and then this skirt is a
tribal<00:01:11.920> print<00:01:12.920> skirt<00:01:13.189> that<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.369> just<00:01:13.729> got<00:01:13.880> from

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
tribal print skirt that I just got from

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.789 
tribal print skirt that I just got from
forever<00:01:14.150> 21<00:01:14.330> comes<00:01:14.840> with<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.110> bow<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:15.560> I<00:01:15.590> guess

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
forever 21 comes with a bow but I guess

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.230 
forever 21 comes with a bow but I guess
you<00:01:15.950> could<00:01:16.070> take<00:01:16.250> out<00:01:16.460> since<00:01:16.790> there<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
you could take out since there is the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.210 
you could take out since there is the
option<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.740> keep<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.009> tied

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
option of it but I like to keep it tied

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.890 
option of it but I like to keep it tied
because<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.820> just<00:01:19.970> adds<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.299> little<00:01:20.390> something

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
because it just adds a little something

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.990 
because it just adds a little something
and<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.200> keep<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.560> tied<00:01:21.770> in<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.369> form<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.880> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
and I just keep it tied in the form of a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.569 
and I just keep it tied in the form of a
belt<00:01:24.579> like<00:01:25.579> this<00:01:26.470> I'm<00:01:27.470> not<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.860> best<00:01:28.100> bow<00:01:28.310> tire

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
belt like this I'm not the best bow tire

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.460 
belt like this I'm not the best bow tire

I still do bunny ears which is kind of

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.080 
I still do bunny ears which is kind of
ironic<00:01:30.590> since<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.340> Easter<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:31.970> guess<00:01:32.450> and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
ironic since it is Easter I guess and

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.340 
ironic since it is Easter I guess and
just<00:01:35.090> kind<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.299> weird<00:01:35.509> in<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.750> middle<00:01:35.990> I'll

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
just kind of weird in the middle I'll

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.780 
just kind of weird in the middle I'll
probably<00:01:36.619> redo<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.070> offer<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.460> make<00:01:37.579> a<00:01:37.610> little

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
probably redo it offer to make a little

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.480 
probably redo it offer to make a little
