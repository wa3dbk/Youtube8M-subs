00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.920
 [music] 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.840
 every day the number of car owners 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.180
 growing this can be judged by the morning 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.430
 and evening traffic jams however 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 all in the summer tend to change to 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.789
 more lightweight mode of transport 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.580
 nevertheless wishing to purchase 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.860
 bike or scooter enough today 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.080
 in the program we will tell you about what 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.640
 technical parameters should be considered when 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.239
 choosing a scooter 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:45.129
 [music] 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.019
 Today, the choice of motorcycles in Russia as 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.540
 never extensive of all this 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.119
 varieties especially stand out scooters 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.250
 they are comfortable for city driving 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:56.500
 giving a scooter is very easy just 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.439
 management and does not require special skills 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.479
 driver's license is also not needed with 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.369
 it is easy for both adults 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.409
 child or pensioner before 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.479
 you need to acquire this type of transport 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.070
 know what scooters are generally available 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.320
 first classification by 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.360
 producing countries in the market can 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 see european and japanese and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.710
 Chinese and Russian scooters than 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.780
 they differ between themselves and on what 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.520
 need to pay attention when buying in 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.210
 weight is determined first 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.200
 user 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.450
 because the gradation goes from 90 kilograms 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.370
 up to 150 in the second, as it were, we already look at 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 there is a preference for push-pull and 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.790
 four-stroke engines 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.970
 push pull they possess greater 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.700
 capacity per liter of 4 bars they 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.570
 more energy-intensive that is a resource they have 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.000
 above and accordingly they are easier in 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.560
 operating power density of 2 so 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.630
 nicks high enough 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.030
 the same they have a small weight simple 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.860
 the design of such a motor is simply 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.870
 fewer parts since the system 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.510
 gas distribution and lubrication or 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.979
 missing or much simpler 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.080
 four-stroke while the engine is easy 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.180
 amenable to tuning with which 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.670
 can significantly increase power 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.849
 dignity 4 tactics silent operation 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.950
 even traction at low speed 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.560
 gasoline consumption is about one and a half times 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.240
 lower oil costs lower than two 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.070
 so not 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.350
 it changes only with technical 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.840
 maintenance while push pull 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.940
 motors eat oil constantly even 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.040
 despite the separate lubrication system 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.140
 their maximum speed goes different 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.240
 if it is a four-stroke engine, then it 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.690
 goes up to 60 kilometers per hour 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.230
 if it is push pull then up to 80 volume 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470
 engine 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 it is important to consider as by 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.730
 we are not subject to legislation 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.320
 taxes do not need me no registration 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.340
 driving license for mopeds up 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.160
 50 cubes 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.910
 over 50 is already needed 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.070
 check in 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 scooter speed depends on 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.090
 installed engine and other 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.830
 characteristics of a particular model however 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.320
 more specifically 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.750
 maximum speed scooter 50 cubes 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.880
 as a rule does not exceed 50 60 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.590
 kilometers per hour and powerful models with 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.330
 engine large cubic capacity can 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.610
 accelerate and up to one hundred one hundred twenty 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.260
 kilometers per hour nevertheless scooter 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.870
 designed for driving in urban environments 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 so lovers of country trips and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 better to buy not a scooter but a motorcycle 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.930
 especially as some scooters have 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.400
 speed limiters first 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.230
 be sure to know the rules 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.730
 traffic and in driving he 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.980
 almost like a bike all 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.800
 control is focused on the steering wheel 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 rest work only hands get broken 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.930
 all and most as it is not recommended or 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.040
 standing into this technically sophisticated goods not 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.080
 such things need to mount 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.030
 special services if we talk about 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.640
 scooter speeds are the fastest 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.890
 Japanese are considered even milk motor 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.380
 models of these manufacturers are capable 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.540
 reach speeds of up to 75 kilometers in 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.830
 hour and although the maximum speed which 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.350
 is one of the main criteria 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.080
 choice there is a speed limit 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.930
 when driving in the city in any case average 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.940
 speeds of 50 60 to meters per hour is quite 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.950
 enough for urban travel 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.810
 roads especially since ours 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.940
 congested highways 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.980
 especially accelerate will not succeed and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.620
 a great desire to regulate the speed 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.870
 scooter is simple enough to increase 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.360
 speed you need to smoothly turn up 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.640
 strong grip on yourself a to reduce 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.860
 speed release it, it should be 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.630
 consider what's on the speedometer most often 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.560
 reflected overvalued 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.360
 speeds 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.550
 but this does not mean that you need to squeeze out 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.020
 his maximum 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.699
 [music] 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.590
 before you go out on the road only 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.750
 what is purchased transport worth 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.150
 learn the road rules so as not to 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.490
 hinder movement by the way do not forget 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.440
 take care remedy wish you 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.440
 good luck and smooth roads yet
