 for the second time a very 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.940
 by the male 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.660

 we found it and this mix leads us to 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.340

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.400
 two points for this is that this mixed 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.700
 of emotions 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.730
 in the negative result team 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.599
 really enhance the work 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.239
 found it in the second part 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.670
 really gave the image in values ​​and 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.610
 high that what is the clear saint was 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.610

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.370
 insecure that the problem is that we try 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.430
 improving through hamas was difficult and the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.200
 Our adversary is that I go with this 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.200
