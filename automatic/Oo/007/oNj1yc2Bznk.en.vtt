00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
had actually dripped everywhere and was

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.069 
had actually dripped everywhere and was
all<00:02:57.160> over<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.730> rest<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:58.359> all<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.690> did<00:02:58.930> was

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
all over the rest of them all I did was

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.430 
all over the rest of them all I did was
spray<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> with<00:02:59.530> alcohol<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.209> clean<00:03:01.629> it<00:03:01.810> you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
spray it with alcohol and clean it you

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.140 
spray it with alcohol and clean it you
can<00:03:02.590> still<00:03:02.769> see<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.910> green

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
can still see a little bit of the green

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.170 
can still see a little bit of the green
on<00:03:04.540> here

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
on here

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.569 
on here
and<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:08.019> cleaned<00:03:08.349> up<00:03:08.470> most<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.280> still

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
and I cleaned up most of it but it still

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.400 
and I cleaned up most of it but it still
keeps<00:03:09.760> dripping<00:03:10.090> down<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.900> I'll<00:03:11.109> just<00:03:11.260> keep

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
keeps dripping down so I'll just keep

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.069 
keeps dripping down so I'll just keep
cleaning<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:12.099> but<00:03:12.700> um<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.390> would<00:03:13.780> say<00:03:13.900> probably

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
cleaning it but um I would say probably

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.180 
cleaning it but um I would say probably
about<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.560> third<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.430> polish<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.889> gone<00:03:17.889> but

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
about a third of the polish is gone but

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.890 
about a third of the polish is gone but
there's<00:03:18.430> still<00:03:18.639> quite<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:18.910> bit<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.299> there<00:03:19.510> so

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
there's still quite a bit in there so

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.180 
there's still quite a bit in there so
that's<00:03:20.139> just<00:03:20.260> something<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.709> keep<00:03:20.859> in<00:03:21.010> mind

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
that's just something to keep in mind

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.770 
that's just something to keep in mind

of<00:04:11.010> what<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.250> colors<00:04:11.549> look<00:04:11.819> like<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:12.599> is

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
of what the colors look like so this is

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.229 
of what the colors look like so this is
number<00:04:12.989> zero<00:04:13.170> eight<00:04:13.739> five<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:14.610> it's<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.940> pretty

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
number zero eight five and it's a pretty

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.199 
number zero eight five and it's a pretty

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
kind of medium shade blue and if you

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.580 
kind of medium shade blue and if you
compare<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.900> one<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.139> can<00:04:19.350> see<00:04:19.380> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
compare it to this one you can see the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.289 
compare it to this one you can see the
difference<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.340> more<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.699> baby<00:04:20.940> blue

little bit of a stronger smell I mean it
wasn't<00:05:18.870> horrible<00:05:19.289> but<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.979> was<00:05:20.340> kind<00:05:20.580> of

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
wasn't horrible but it was kind of

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.270 
wasn't horrible but it was kind of
chemically<00:05:21.560> kind<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.650> had<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.770> chemical<00:05:23.070> smell

to it and a little bit sweet if that

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.140 
to it and a little bit sweet if that
makes<00:05:25.110> sense<00:05:25.200> so<00:05:25.680> that's<00:05:26.610> something<00:05:26.880> else<00:05:27.000> to

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
makes sense so that's something else to

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.839 
makes sense so that's something else to
keep<00:05:27.300> an<00:05:27.479> eye<00:05:27.720> out<00:05:27.750> for<00:05:27.960> guys<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:29.310> that<00:05:29.520> does<00:05:29.700> it
