00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
well hello there Minecrafters thanks for

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.530 
well hello there Minecrafters thanks for
coming<00:00:02.010> by<00:00:02.159> today<00:00:02.460> we<00:00:02.879> are<00:00:03.090> going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.389> be

coming by today we are going to be

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.079 
coming by today we are going to be
talking<00:00:03.780> about<00:00:03.959> command<00:00:04.759> randomizers<00:00:05.759> now

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
talking about command randomizers now

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.480 
talking about command randomizers now
that<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> mechanic<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:08.309> as<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
that is a mechanic that you as a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.549 
that is a mechanic that you as a
mapmaker<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:09.360> use<00:00:09.630> if<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.990> wanted<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
mapmaker can use if you wanted to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.730 
mapmaker can use if you wanted to
randomly<00:00:11.250> select<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.969> single<00:00:12.929> command<00:00:13.410> out<00:00:13.590> of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
randomly select a single command out of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.730 
randomly select a single command out of
a<00:00:13.830> group<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.400> commands<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.089> for<00:00:16.080> example<00:00:16.170> in

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a group of commands so for example in

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
a group of commands so for example in
diversity<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> map<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> helped

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
diversity two of the map that I helped

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.740 
diversity two of the map that I helped
out<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.010> we<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.640> section<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> arena

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
out with we have a section in the arena

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
random coordinates and I don't want the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.490 
random coordinates and I don't want the
player<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:28.170> they're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to

player to know where they're going to
pop<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.130> want<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.880> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
pop up I just want them to kind of just

pop up at any sort of interval or at a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.799 
pop up at any sort of interval or at a
red<00:00:34.170> random<00:00:34.649> basically<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.390> what<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.540> have

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
red random basically and what we have

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
red random basically and what we have
been<00:00:37.110> using<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.280> point<00:00:38.790> eight

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
been using now I have one point eight

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.240 
been using now I have one point eight
point<00:00:39.120> five<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.960> version<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.010> was

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
point five this is the version that was

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
point five this is the version that was
released<00:00:41.730> before<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.510> current<00:00:42.899> version<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
released before the current version of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
released before the current version of
this<00:00:43.620> video<00:00:44.030> but<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.270> point<00:00:45.450> eight<00:00:45.510> point

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this video but in one point eight point

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
this video but in one point eight point
five<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.649> think<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> beginning<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
five and I think from the beginning of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.619 
five and I think from the beginning of
1.8<00:00:48.980> mapmakers<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.670> believe<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:51.449> much

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
1.8 mapmakers I I believe pretty much

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
1.8 mapmakers I I believe pretty much
everybody<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.530> using<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.129> randomizer<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
everybody was using this randomizer you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.470 
everybody was using this randomizer you
put<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.829> commands<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
put your your commands in here be it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
put your your commands in here be it
summon<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:58.260> whatever<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.430> hit<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> with

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
summon or whatever it is you hit it with

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
summon or whatever it is you hit it with
that<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.739> redstone<00:01:02.039> block<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that and on a redstone block and it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.810 
that and on a redstone block and it
fires<00:01:02.850> off<00:01:03.120> any<00:01:03.510> commander<00:01:03.930> random<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
fires off any commander random so this

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300 
fires off any commander random so this
was<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.590> far<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.950> most<00:01:08.070> popular

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
was I think by far the most popular

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.780 
was I think by far the most popular
randomizer<00:01:09.710> diversity<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> had<00:01:11.070> its<00:01:11.280> impervia

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
randomizer diversity to had its impervia

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.359 
randomizer diversity to had its impervia
had<00:01:12.000> every<00:01:12.330> basically<00:01:12.869> every<00:01:13.110> 1.8<00:01:13.590> map<00:01:13.799> maker

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
had every basically every 1.8 map maker

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.520 
had every basically every 1.8 map maker
i<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.150> use<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.770> method<00:01:17.580> but

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
i can think of use this this method but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
i can think of use this this method but
unfortunately<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.189> point<00:01:20.460> two<00:01:20.549> point<00:01:20.729> six

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
unfortunately in one point two point six

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
unfortunately in one point two point six
that<00:01:21.360> feature<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:22.350> removed<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.400> when

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that feature was removed and now when

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.440 
that feature was removed and now when
you<00:01:23.759> hit<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> basically<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> broken<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you hit it so basically it is broken a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
you hit it so basically it is broken a
lot<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.320> maps<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.829> broken<00:01:32.159> diversity<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
lot of maps it's broken diversity to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380 
lot of maps it's broken diversity to
it's<00:01:33.119> broken<00:01:33.390> pretty<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.350> every<00:01:35.150> every<00:01:36.150> map

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's broken pretty much every every map

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
it's broken pretty much every every map
maker<00:01:36.600> I've<00:01:36.720> talked<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.860> use<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
maker I've talked to is to use this and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.330 
maker I've talked to is to use this and
it's<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.560> frustrating<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's it's it's pretty frustrating and it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's it's it's pretty frustrating and it
was<00:01:41.460> removed<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.150> purpose<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
was removed on purpose because of a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420 
was removed on purpose because of a
security<00:01:44.880> exploit<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> could<00:01:47.040> possibly

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
security exploit that you could possibly

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.330 
security exploit that you could possibly
give<00:01:48.420> yourself<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.439> any<00:01:49.680> server<00:01:49.979> and

dealing wreak havoc so that was the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
dealing wreak havoc so that was the
decision<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.759> Malika<00:01:54.180> found<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.079> have

be another strip beside it and you can

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.840 
be another strip beside it and you can
put<00:02:47.680> them<00:02:47.830> side<00:02:48.070> by<00:02:48.100> side<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.700> won't

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
put them side by side and it won't

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.580 
put them side by side and it won't
interfere<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.300> each<00:02:49.450> other<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.470> I'm<00:02:50.560> going

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
interfere with each other so I'm going

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320 
interfere with each other so I'm going
to<00:02:50.709> show<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.950> how<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.160> did<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.489> I've<00:02:51.880> got<00:02:52.090> two

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
to show you how I did that I've got two

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.390 
to show you how I did that I've got two
methods<00:02:52.720> I've<00:02:52.840> got<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.050> repeating<00:02:53.830> randomizer

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
methods I've got a repeating randomizer

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.360 
methods I've got a repeating randomizer
and<00:02:54.700> I've<00:02:54.820> also<00:02:55.030> got<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:56.370> non-repeating

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and I've also got a non-repeating

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.540 
and I've also got a non-repeating
randomised<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.930> first<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.410> all<00:02:59.470> how<00:03:00.400> this

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
randomised so first of all how this

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.449 
randomised so first of all how this
works<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:01.000> with<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.480> random<00:03:02.140> this<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.709> at

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
works is with the random this is the at

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.180 
works is with the random this is the at
our<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.540> we're<00:03:04.810> at<00:03:05.050> our<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.560> an<00:03:05.650> arm<00:03:05.830> stand

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
our so we're at our and an arm stand

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.670 
our so we're at our and an arm stand
this<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:06.970> very<00:03:07.090> common<00:03:07.630> method<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.530> the

this is a very common method of the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.590 
this is a very common method of the
people<00:03:08.920> have<00:03:09.010> used<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.519> under<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.330> break<00:03:10.480> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
people have used I under to break it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.150 
people have used I under to break it
down<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.750> little<00:03:10.900> bit<00:03:11.050> slower<00:03:11.319> for<00:03:11.650> new<00:03:11.950> map

down a little bit slower for new map
makers<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:13.330> I've<00:03:13.420> done<00:03:13.630> over<00:03:14.140> here<00:03:14.170> is

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
makers but what I've done over here is

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
makers but what I've done over here is
I've<00:03:15.100> summoned<00:03:15.760> all<00:03:15.970> these<00:03:16.150> armor<00:03:16.480> stands

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
I've summoned all these armor stands

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.590 
I've summoned all these armor stands
here<00:03:17.140> through<00:03:17.739> these<00:03:17.890> command<00:03:18.250> blocks<00:03:18.600> they

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
here through these command blocks they

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.270 
here through these command blocks they
are<00:03:19.780> small<00:03:20.079> armor<00:03:20.380> stands<00:03:20.620> does<00:03:20.890> not<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.190> be

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
are small armor stands does not to be

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.220 
are small armor stands does not to be
small<00:03:21.519> their<00:03:21.820> marker<00:03:22.299> armor<00:03:22.780> stands<00:03:23.019> which

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
small their marker armor stands which

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.870 
small their marker armor stands which
means<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.560> cannot<00:03:23.980> interact<00:03:24.340> with<00:03:24.700> them

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
means you cannot interact with them

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.150 
means you cannot interact with them
which<00:03:25.750> may<00:03:25.989> or<00:03:26.019> may<00:03:26.230> not<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.410> important<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
which may or may not be important and

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.699 
which may or may not be important and
I've<00:03:27.820> customized<00:03:28.720> their<00:03:28.930> name<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.290> random

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
I've customized their name to random

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.370 
I've customized their name to random
output<00:03:29.920> one<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.209> ones<00:03:31.510> at<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.720> end<00:03:31.989> here

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
output one now the ones at the end here

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.860 
output one now the ones at the end here
I<00:03:32.410> didn't<00:03:33.070> put<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.880> name<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.780> you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
I didn't put a name on just so that you

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.569 
I didn't put a name on just so that you
can<00:03:34.989> see<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.470> they<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.799> not<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.070> selected

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
can see that they will not be selected

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.110 
can see that they will not be selected
when<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.209> randomizing<00:03:38.200> takes<00:03:38.440> place<00:03:39.120> but

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
when the randomizing takes place but

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.120 
when the randomizing takes place but
what<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.360> can<00:03:40.570> do<00:03:40.720> also<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.530> can<00:03:41.680> put<00:03:41.859> their

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
what I can do also is I can put their

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.210 
what I can do also is I can put their
their<00:03:42.820> name<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.600> can<00:03:43.720> see<00:03:44.070> there<00:03:45.070> we've

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
their name on so you can see there we've

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.509 
their name on so you can see there we've
got<00:03:45.250> random<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.120> random<00:03:46.810> output<00:03:46.989> 1<00:03:47.560> those<00:03:48.070> five

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
got random I random output 1 those five

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.000 
got random I random output 1 those five
or<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.299> five<00:03:49.480> yeah<00:03:49.750> 5<00:03:49.780> or<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> random<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.680> put<00:03:50.859> one

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
or so five yeah 5 or a random I put one

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.190 
or so five yeah 5 or a random I put one
and<00:03:51.220> then<00:03:51.340> these<00:03:51.430> last<00:03:51.700> four<00:03:51.940> don't<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:52.989> that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
and then these last four don't have that

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.080 
and then these last four don't have that
name<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.650> they<00:03:53.799> will<00:03:54.010> not<00:03:54.160> be<00:03:54.340> affected<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:54.910> just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
name so they will not be affected I just

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.330 
name so they will not be affected I just
put<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.299> there<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:55.750> can<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.350> as<00:03:57.130> soon

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
put it there so you can see and as soon

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.479 
put it there so you can see and as soon
as<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.700> put<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.269> clock<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:59.070> you've<00:04:00.070> got<00:04:00.280> some

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
as I put the clock on you've got some

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.130 
as I put the clock on you've got some
random<00:04:00.790> outputs<00:04:01.120> there<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.690> could<00:04:01.989> be

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
random outputs there it could be

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.250 
random outputs there it could be
repeating<00:04:02.680> 22<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.370> could<00:04:03.579> be<00:04:03.730> anything

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
repeating 22 it could be anything

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.770 
repeating 22 it could be anything
doesn't<00:04:05.260> matter<00:04:05.350> it's<00:04:05.590> completely<00:04:06.100> random

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
doesn't matter it's completely random

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.240 
doesn't matter it's completely random
the<00:04:07.780> way<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.320> works<00:04:08.620> let<00:04:08.950> me<00:04:09.070> just

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
the way that that works let me just

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.830 
the way that that works let me just
actually<00:04:09.459> turn<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.910> invisible<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.630> can

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
actually turn it invisible so you can

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.860 
actually turn it invisible so you can
you<00:04:11.769> can<00:04:11.950> actually<00:04:12.130> there<00:04:13.120> we<00:04:13.239> go<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.750> can

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
you can actually there we go you can

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.750 
you can actually there we go you can
actually<00:04:13.989> see<00:04:14.170> it's<00:04:14.500> working<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:15.040> take<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.579> day

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
actually see it's working I take the day

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.810 
actually see it's working I take the day
off<00:04:16.289> there<00:04:17.289> we<00:04:17.350> go<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.250> it's<00:04:18.430> pretty<00:04:18.609> cool<00:04:18.760> that

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
off there we go so it's pretty cool that

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.990 
off there we go so it's pretty cool that
way<00:04:19.150> so<00:04:19.810> what's<00:04:20.140> happening<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.849> every<00:04:21.849> time

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
way so what's happening is every time

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.490 
way so what's happening is every time
the<00:04:22.150> clock<00:04:22.360> fires<00:04:22.659> off<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.110> could<00:04:23.260> even<00:04:23.349> use

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
the clock fires off you could even use

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.440 
the clock fires off you could even use
as<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> button<00:04:24.130> doesn't<00:04:24.729> matter<00:04:24.880> any<00:04:25.180> type<00:04:25.419> of

as a button doesn't matter any type of

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.610 
as a button doesn't matter any type of
input<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:26.020> it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
named random output one you can make up

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.750 
named random output one you can make up

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
the name whatever you like it's going to

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.719 
the name whatever you like it's going to
set<00:04:34.000> block<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.600> redstone<00:04:35.050> block<00:04:35.500> at<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.340> armor

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
set block a redstone block at that armor

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.290 
set block a redstone block at that armor
stuff<00:04:36.940> armor<00:04:37.419> stand<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:39.490> I'm<00:04:39.760> added<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
stuff armor stand and it's I'm added the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.710 
stuff armor stand and it's I'm added the
destroy<00:04:40.810> tag<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:41.620> case<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:43.240> some<00:04:43.449> weird

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
destroy tag just in case for some weird

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.950 
destroy tag just in case for some weird
reason<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.880> redstone<00:04:45.880> block<00:04:46.150> got<00:04:46.660> stuck

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
reason the redstone block got stuck

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.430 
reason the redstone block got stuck
there<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.410> then<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:48.010> didn't<00:04:48.820> disappear<00:04:49.440> then

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
there and then it didn't disappear then

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.409 
there and then it didn't disappear then
the<00:04:50.590> next<00:04:50.710> time<00:04:50.949> if<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.610> tried<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.090> set<00:04:52.300> off

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
the next time if it tried to set off

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.200 
the next time if it tried to set off
that<00:04:52.630> command<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:54.490> wouldn't<00:04:54.850> be<00:04:54.880> able<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.090> do

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
that command it wouldn't be able to do

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.340 
that command it wouldn't be able to do
it<00:04:55.300> because<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:55.600> be<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.750> redstone<00:04:56.080> block

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
it because there be a redstone block

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.960 
it because there be a redstone block
there<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:56.710> I've<00:04:56.979> got<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.190> strike<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.669> minute

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
there so I've got the strike a minute

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.330 
there so I've got the strike a minute
just<00:04:58.090> in<00:04:58.240> case<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.510> breaks<00:04:58.660> but<00:04:59.440> up<00:04:59.650> top<00:04:59.889> any

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
just in case it breaks but up top any

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.370 
just in case it breaks but up top any
redstone<00:05:00.940> block<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.479> gets<00:05:01.690> set<00:05:01.930> underneath

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
redstone block that gets set underneath

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.140 
redstone block that gets set underneath
whichever<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.160> command<00:05:03.430> block<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.789> sets<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.120> to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
whichever a command block it sets it to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.360 
whichever a command block it sets it to
air<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.630> then<00:05:05.440> down<00:05:05.710> here<00:05:05.740> is<00:05:06.160> where<00:05:06.340> you

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
air and then down here is where you

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.689 
air and then down here is where you
would<00:05:06.610> put<00:05:06.820> all<00:05:07.150> those<00:05:08.010> commands<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.340> whatever

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
would put all those commands so whatever

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.150 
would put all those commands so whatever
you<00:05:09.820> have<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.270> your<00:05:10.389> dispenser<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.199> would<00:05:11.979> put

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
you have in your dispenser you would put

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.439 
you have in your dispenser you would put
them<00:05:12.310> down<00:05:12.490> here<00:05:12.760> now<00:05:12.880> if<00:05:13.000> you're<00:05:13.120> building<00:05:13.270> a

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
them down here now if you're building a

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.270 
them down here now if you're building a
map<00:05:13.630> from<00:05:13.780> scratch<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.320> could<00:05:14.440> totally<00:05:14.590> you

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
map from scratch you could totally you

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.980 
map from scratch you could totally you
can<00:05:15.430> totally<00:05:15.820> use<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.419> method<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.840> works

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
can totally use this method it works

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.290 
can totally use this method it works
awesome<00:05:17.380> this<00:05:17.889> is<00:05:18.070> hopefully<00:05:18.669> gonna<00:05:18.880> help

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
awesome this is hopefully gonna help

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.480 
awesome this is hopefully gonna help
replace<00:05:19.720> some<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> broken<00:05:20.710> maps<00:05:21.039> if<00:05:21.370> you

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
replace some of the broken maps if you

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.310 
replace some of the broken maps if you
have<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:21.940> space<00:05:22.060> that's<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.810> most<00:05:22.930> important

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
have the space that's the most important

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.770 
have the space that's the most important
thing<00:05:23.350> if<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.710> have<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.160> space<00:05:24.449> so<00:05:25.449> this<00:05:25.600> is<00:05:25.750> a

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
thing if you have the space so this is a

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.300 
thing if you have the space so this is a
repeating<00:05:26.260> randomizer<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.830> will<00:05:26.919> constantly

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
repeating randomizer it will constantly

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.980 
repeating randomizer it will constantly
just<00:05:27.610> go<00:05:28.210> off<00:05:28.620> even<00:05:29.620> if<00:05:29.770> whoopsie<00:05:30.400> even<00:05:30.639> if<00:05:30.990> you

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
just go off even if whoopsie even if you

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.150 
just go off even if whoopsie even if you

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
didn't want to do it if you add a one

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.420 
didn't want to do it if you add a one
input<00:05:33.729> there<00:05:34.690> you<00:05:35.620> see<00:05:35.650> it's<00:05:35.919> completely

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
here it's same sort of thing here we've

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.760 
here it's same sort of thing here we've
got<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:21.160> at<00:06:21.490> random<00:06:22.120> armorstand<00:06:22.770> random

got the at random armorstand random

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.629 
got the at random armorstand random
output<00:06:23.919> too<00:06:24.370> so<00:06:24.960> depending<00:06:25.960> on<00:06:26.050> how<00:06:26.229> many

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.159 
output too so depending on how many
random<00:06:27.639> monsters<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:28.150> want<00:06:28.389> you<00:06:28.750> change<00:06:29.020> the

random monsters you want you change the

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.200 
random monsters you want you change the

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
name of the armor stands and you can

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.029 
name of the armor stands and you can
actually<00:06:31.389> put<00:06:31.750> them<00:06:31.930> side<00:06:32.199> by<00:06:32.229> side<00:06:32.440> if<00:06:32.919> you

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
actually put them side by side if you

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.300 
actually put them side by side if you
like<00:06:33.190> now<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.180> difference<00:06:34.419> is<00:06:34.950> this<00:06:35.950> command

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
like now the difference is this command

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.399 
like now the difference is this command
here<00:06:36.610> we're<00:06:37.240> going<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.419> kill<00:06:37.690> the<00:06:37.960> armorstand

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
here we're going to kill the armorstand

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.050 
here we're going to kill the armorstand
that<00:06:38.890> is<00:06:39.010> directly<00:06:39.550> below

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
that is directly below

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.520 
that is directly below
lo<00:06:40.470> whatever<00:06:41.470> it<00:06:41.620> is<00:06:41.770> so<00:06:42.240> I've<00:06:43.240> got<00:06:43.870> a<00:06:43.900> DX<00:06:44.290> dy

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
lo whatever it is so I've got a DX dy

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.000 
lo whatever it is so I've got a DX dy
and<00:06:44.919> DZ<00:06:45.720> at<00:06:46.720> negative<00:06:46.960> 2<00:06:47.139> which<00:06:47.620> means<00:06:47.889> that

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
and DZ at negative 2 which means that

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.760 
and DZ at negative 2 which means that
the<00:06:48.880> one<00:06:49.030> directly<00:06:49.360> below<00:06:49.600> it<00:06:49.660> will<00:06:49.960> will

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
the one directly below it will will

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.550 
the one directly below it will will
actually<00:06:51.190> die<00:06:51.639> if<00:06:52.120> I<00:06:52.240> remove<00:06:52.840> that<00:06:53.050> it's<00:06:53.380> not

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
actually die if I remove that it's not

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560 
actually die if I remove that it's not
there<00:06:53.830> that's<00:06:54.490> cool<00:06:54.669> because<00:06:54.850> if<00:06:55.240> this<00:06:55.419> gets

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
there that's cool because if this gets

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.790 
there that's cool because if this gets
fired<00:06:55.960> off<00:06:56.230> again<00:06:56.650> because<00:06:57.400> it<00:06:57.669> is<00:06:58.800> executing

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
fired off again because it is executing

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.030 
fired off again because it is executing
at<00:06:59.980> this<00:07:00.430> number<00:07:01.120> two<00:07:01.300> there<00:07:01.810> isn't<00:07:02.290> a<00:07:02.470> armor

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
at this number two there isn't a armor

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.350 
at this number two there isn't a armor
stand<00:07:03.310> in<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.580> selection<00:07:03.910> for<00:07:04.870> the<00:07:05.500> for<00:07:06.250> the

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
stand in the selection for the for the

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.300 
stand in the selection for the for the
input<00:07:07.360> to<00:07:07.810> select<00:07:08.169> so<00:07:08.560> it<00:07:08.620> always<00:07:08.830> has<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:09.220> be

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
input to select so it always has to be

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.780 
input to select so it always has to be
different<00:07:09.840> until<00:07:10.840> you<00:07:11.830> select<00:07:12.040> until

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:12.790 
different until you select until

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.010 
different until you select until
basically<00:07:13.120> it's<00:07:13.540> all<00:07:14.250> given<00:07:15.250> up<00:07:15.370> here<00:07:15.610> so<00:07:16.570> that

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.020 
basically it's all given up here so that

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.010 
basically it's all given up here so that
is<00:07:17.229> a<00:07:17.260> non-repeating<00:07:18.160> randomised<00:07:18.490> and<00:07:19.330> I<00:07:19.810> can

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
is a non-repeating randomised and I can

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.620 
is a non-repeating randomised and I can
think<00:07:20.229> of<00:07:20.350> a<00:07:20.470> lot<00:07:20.500> of<00:07:20.770> uses<00:07:20.919> for<00:07:21.070> that<00:07:21.340> as<00:07:21.490> well

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 
think of a lot of uses for that as well

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.730 
think of a lot of uses for that as well
and<00:07:22.630> then<00:07:22.840> if<00:07:22.990> you<00:07:23.080> want<00:07:23.260> to<00:07:23.320> reset<00:07:23.590> it<00:07:23.620> you

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
and then if you want to reset it you

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.280 
and then if you want to reset it you
just<00:07:23.889> boom<00:07:24.520> kill<00:07:24.820> them<00:07:25.000> all<00:07:25.090> and<00:07:25.120> then<00:07:25.660> remove

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
just boom kill them all and then remove

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.860 
just boom kill them all and then remove
all<00:07:26.440> the<00:07:26.590> redstone<00:07:27.580> blocks<00:07:27.820> but<00:07:28.000> for<00:07:28.660> my

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
all the redstone blocks but for my

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.920 
all the redstone blocks but for my
purpose<00:07:29.380> this<00:07:29.620> is<00:07:30.300> probably<00:07:31.300> going<00:07:31.750> to

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
purpose this is probably going to

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.190 
purpose this is probably going to

helps<00:07:35.470> you<00:07:36.220> guys<00:07:36.250> I<00:07:36.729> really<00:07:37.389> really<00:07:38.200> do<00:07:38.410> want

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
helps you guys I really really do want

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.070 
helps you guys I really really do want
to<00:07:39.400> help<00:07:39.490> the<00:07:39.729> map<00:07:39.880> making<00:07:40.120> community<00:07:40.630> and<00:07:40.870> I

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 
to help the map making community and I

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.800 
to help the map making community and I
think<00:07:41.110> this<00:07:41.770> is<00:07:41.830> probably<00:07:42.010> the<00:07:42.639> best<00:07:43.150> method

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
think this is probably the best method

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.700 
think this is probably the best method
that<00:07:44.020> I've<00:07:44.289> seen<00:07:45.900> and<00:07:46.900> try<00:07:47.169> to<00:07:47.229> break<00:07:47.440> it<00:07:47.590> down

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.710 
that I've seen and try to break it down

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.260 
that I've seen and try to break it down
slowly<00:07:47.950> so<00:07:48.220> you<00:07:48.250> kind<00:07:48.520> of<00:07:48.580> understand<00:07:49.000> how<00:07:49.210> the

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.270 
slowly so you kind of understand how the

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.270 
slowly so you kind of understand how the
randomizing<00:07:49.960> works<00:07:50.110> because<00:07:50.440> not<00:07:51.070> every

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 
randomizing works because not every

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.890 
randomizing works because not every
randomizer<00:07:51.820> needs<00:07:52.210> a<00:07:52.390> clock<00:07:52.660> running

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:52.900 
randomizer needs a clock running

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.570 
randomizer needs a clock running
sometimes<00:07:53.350> you<00:07:53.470> just<00:07:53.620> want<00:07:53.860> a<00:07:53.950> single<00:07:54.220> input

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580 
sometimes you just want a single input

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.630 
sometimes you just want a single input
we<00:07:55.419> don't<00:07:55.570> want<00:07:55.840> we<00:07:56.410> just<00:07:57.100> want<00:07:57.280> to<00:07:57.370> do<00:07:57.430> one
