in<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.800> box<00:02:11.680> it's<00:02:12.680> not<00:02:12.739> bad<00:02:13.099> it's<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.580> oh

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
in the box it's not bad it's going oh

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.940 
in the box it's not bad it's going oh
we've<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.720> continuous<00:02:15.200> loop<00:02:15.410> going<00:02:15.620> but

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
we've got the continuous loop going but

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.860 
we've got the continuous loop going but
I<00:02:15.980> think<00:02:16.280> we<00:02:16.430> could<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.880> bit<00:02:17.420> closer

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
I think we could do with a bit closer

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.140 
I think we could do with a bit closer
here<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:19.069> maybe<00:02:19.190> pointing<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> sound<00:02:19.940> hole<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
here and maybe pointing the sound hole a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:31.180 
here and maybe pointing the sound hole a
bit<00:02:20.330> me<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:30.170> guitar<00:02:30.319> parts<00:02:30.800> will<00:02:30.920> fill<00:02:31.099> out

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
bit me the guitar parts will fill out

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.949 
bit me the guitar parts will fill out
the<00:02:31.310> track<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:31.849> most<00:02:32.030> importantly<00:02:32.540> they're

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
the track but most importantly they're

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.479 
the track but most importantly they're
going<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.230> adding<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> rhythm<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:33.980> groove

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
going to be adding the rhythm and groove

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.550 
going to be adding the rhythm and groove
to<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.670> tune<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.720> I'll<00:02:35.810> be<00:02:35.900> starting<00:02:36.260> off<00:02:36.349> with

to the tune so I'll be starting off with

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.290 
to the tune so I'll be starting off with
some<00:02:36.739> simple<00:02:37.160> rhythmic<00:02:37.610> chops<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:41.060> I'll<00:02:41.209> be

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.879 
a nice stereo image we've got one a
little<00:04:08.370> bit<00:04:08.730> there<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.239> go<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.450> can<00:04:09.690> see

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
little bit there you go you can see

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.229 
little bit there you go you can see
slightly<00:04:10.889> different<00:04:11.370> sounds<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:12.000> we've<00:04:12.120> got<00:04:12.209> a

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
slightly different sounds so we've got a

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.289 
slightly different sounds so we've got a
nice<00:04:12.389> overall<00:04:13.200> round<00:04:13.560> stereo<00:04:13.980> image<00:04:14.220> shed<00:04:15.060> a

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
nice overall round stereo image shed a

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.120 
nice overall round stereo image shed a
little<00:04:15.630> bit<00:04:15.870> more<00:04:16.019> bass<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:16.410> one<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.709> little<00:04:16.919> bit

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
little bit more bass on one a little bit

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.009 
little bit more bass on one a little bit
more<00:04:17.160> treble<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.700> other<00:04:17.850> as<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.810> see

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
more treble on the other as you can see

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.990 
more treble on the other as you can see
here<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.440> image<00:04:19.579> we've<00:04:20.579> got<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.729> little<00:04:20.910> bit

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
here on the image we've got a little bit

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.590 
here on the image we've got a little bit
of<00:04:21.060> compression<00:04:21.239> not<00:04:21.660> too<00:04:21.900> much<00:04:22.109> not<00:04:22.740> too<00:04:22.800> much

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
of compression not too much not too much

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.570 
of compression not too much not too much
it's<00:04:24.600> nice<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.960> punchy<00:04:25.350> we've<00:04:26.310> got<00:04:26.460> that

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
it's nice and punchy we've got that

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.310 
it's nice and punchy we've got that
sounded<00:04:26.970> great<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.570> don't<00:04:28.020> think<00:04:28.139> there's<00:04:28.289> a

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
sounded great I don't think there's a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.300 
sounded great I don't think there's a
lot<00:04:28.440> more<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:28.740> need<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:28.979> do<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.190> that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
lot more that we need to do to that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.650 
lot more that we need to do to that
we've<00:04:29.430> got<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.550> good<00:04:29.700> signal<00:04:29.880> good<00:04:30.360> sounding

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
we've got a good signal good sounding

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.940 
we've got a good signal good sounding
thing<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:32.780> waveforms<00:04:33.780> looking<00:04:34.050> good<00:04:34.229> doesn't

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
thing the waveforms looking good doesn't

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.040 
thing the waveforms looking good doesn't
have<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.250> be<00:04:35.340> right<00:04:35.490> up<00:04:35.639> to<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.850> edges<00:04:36.050> there's

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
have to be right up to the edges there's

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.960 
have to be right up to the edges there's
this<00:04:37.320> need<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.190> lot<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.370> people<00:04:38.639> to<00:04:38.789> get<00:04:38.910> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
this need for a lot of people to get the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.310 
this need for a lot of people to get the
wave<00:04:39.120> as<00:04:39.300> big<00:04:39.599> as<00:04:39.780> possible

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
wave as big as possible

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.560 
wave as big as possible
but<00:04:40.500> if<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.680> sounds<00:04:41.010> right<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.520> mean<00:04:42.360> I'm<00:04:42.510> not

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
but if it sounds right I mean I'm not

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.969 
but if it sounds right I mean I'm not
saying<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.930> should<00:04:42.960> be<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.289> miniscule<00:04:43.830> but

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
saying it should be like miniscule but

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.529 
saying it should be like miniscule but
you've<00:04:44.370> got<00:04:44.550> something<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:44.970> fits<00:04:45.270> nicely

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
you've got something that fits nicely

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.360 
you've got something that fits nicely
without<00:04:45.870> peaking<00:04:46.440> without<00:04:46.950> doing<00:04:47.190> too<00:04:47.250> much

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
without peaking without doing too much

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.950 
without peaking without doing too much
and<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.789> can<00:04:47.940> push<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.270> compression<00:04:48.599> and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
and you can push in the compression and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.870 
and you can push in the compression and
you've<00:04:49.410> got<00:04:49.560> space<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:49.950> EQ<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> little<00:04:50.639> bit<00:04:50.760> if

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
you've got space to EQ a little bit if

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.670 
you've got space to EQ a little bit if
you<00:04:50.910> want<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.330> then<00:04:52.080> that's<00:04:52.200> that's<00:04:52.470> about

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
you want to then that's that's about

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.650 
you want to then that's that's about

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
right look at the picket art I've edited

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.360 
right look at the picket art I've edited
out<00:04:54.990> my<00:04:55.139> favourite<00:04:55.470> bit<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.620> picket<00:04:55.950> are<00:04:56.160> here

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
EQ - what's feeling right you can't

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.890 
EQ - what's feeling right you can't
actually<00:05:14.100> guarantee<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:14.880> say<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.510> is<00:05:15.690> right

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
actually guarantee and say this is right

actually guarantee and say this is right
there<00:05:16.560> are<00:05:16.680> processes<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.340> everybody<00:05:17.880> goes

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
there are processes that everybody goes

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.689 
there are processes that everybody goes
through<00:05:18.120> but<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.590> know<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:20.100> can't<00:05:20.340> say<00:05:20.520> one

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
through but you know you can't say one

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.480 
through but you know you can't say one
way<00:05:20.850> is<00:05:21.000> more<00:05:21.900> correct<00:05:22.169> than<00:05:22.199> another<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:23.190> do

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
way is more correct than another just do

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.860 
way is more correct than another just do
what's<00:05:23.699> right<00:05:23.880> with<00:05:24.060> your<00:05:24.240> ears<00:05:24.510> there's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
what's right with your ears there's

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.030 
what's right with your ears there's
there's<00:05:25.110> different<00:05:25.380> ways<00:05:25.470> you<00:05:25.530> can<00:05:25.740> pick<00:05:25.919> up

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
there's different ways you can pick up

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.820 
there's different ways you can pick up
tips<00:05:26.340> but<00:05:27.270> if<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.570> sounds<00:05:27.900> right<00:05:28.050> go<00:05:28.620> with<00:05:28.740> it

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
tips but if it sounds right go with it

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.680 
tips but if it sounds right go with it
so<00:05:31.520> what<00:05:32.520> we've<00:05:32.639> got<00:05:32.669> here<00:05:32.790> is<00:05:33.000> a<00:05:33.030> year<00:05:33.210> 87

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
so what we've got here is a year 87

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.260 
so what we've got here is a year 87
we'll<00:05:34.680> be<00:05:34.860> touching<00:05:35.610> upon<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:36.000> difference

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
we'll be touching upon the difference

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.570 
we'll be touching upon the difference
between<00:05:36.419> a<00:05:36.539> you<00:05:36.660> 87<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.139> 103<00:05:37.380> pretty<00:05:38.190> much<00:05:38.370> the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
between a you 87 and 103 pretty much the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.740 
between a you 87 and 103 pretty much the
naked<00:05:38.820> ear<00:05:38.940> you're<00:05:39.090> not<00:05:39.270> going<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.479> be<00:05:39.539> able<00:05:39.630> to

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
naked ear you're not going to be able to

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.730 
naked ear you're not going to be able to
notice<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.139> difference<00:05:40.440> if<00:05:40.530> you're<00:05:40.650> going

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
notice the difference if you're going

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.590 
notice the difference if you're going
through<00:05:40.889> a<00:05:40.979> nice<00:05:41.310> preamp<00:05:41.940> what<00:05:42.300> we've<00:05:42.419> got

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
through a nice preamp what we've got

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.240 
through a nice preamp what we've got
