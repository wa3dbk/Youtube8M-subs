burst modes and one way that I really
like<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> use<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.350> long<00:01:40.560> range<00:01:40.920> I'll

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
like to use it is at long range I'll

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
like to use it is at long range I'll
actually<00:01:41.610> burst<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.360> short<00:01:42.570> range<00:01:42.750> i'll<00:01:42.990> go

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
actually burst in at short range i'll go

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
actually burst in at short range i'll go
to<00:01:43.170> auto<00:01:43.350> yeah<00:01:43.710> absolutely<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.549> makes

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to auto yeah absolutely it makes

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
to auto yeah absolutely it makes

straight<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.060> out<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.690> UAV<00:02:24.050> will
