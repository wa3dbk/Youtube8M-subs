00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.060 
little bit I don't know if anyone else
who<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> snipers<00:01:56.820> has<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.210> problem<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
who has the snipers has that problem and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
who has the snipers has that problem and
also<00:01:59.479> it's<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.659> an<00:02:00.750> issue<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
also it's not an issue now but I can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770 
also it's not an issue now but I can
definitely<00:02:01.920> seeing<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.640> being<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> issue<00:02:03.060> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
definitely seeing it being the issue in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.700 
definitely seeing it being the issue in
the<00:02:03.899> future<00:02:04.079> since<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.710> goes<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.040> top<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the future since it goes on top of the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
the future since it goes on top of the
what's<00:02:07.710> already<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.360> joystick<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.539> whatever

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
what's already the joystick or whatever

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.300 
what's already the joystick or whatever
it's<00:02:09.989> called

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
it's called

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.699 
it's called
now<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.750> directional<00:02:11.750> stick<00:02:12.380> um<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:14.569> adds<00:02:14.959> one

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
now the directional stick um it adds one

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.140 
now the directional stick um it adds one
to<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.340> could<00:02:16.459> definitely<00:02:16.700> see<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
to it so I could definitely see that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.280 
to it so I could definitely see that
being<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:18.020> very<00:02:18.680> very<00:02:19.220> straining<00:02:19.849> for<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.870> area

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
being a very very straining for the area

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.979 
being a very very straining for the area
in<00:02:21.530> between<00:02:21.680> your<00:02:22.220> pointer<00:02:23.209> finger<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.660> your

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
in between your pointer finger and your

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.850 
in between your pointer finger and your
thumb<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.270> now<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:27.230> area<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.769> know

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
thumb but for now that area you know

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.970 
thumb but for now that area you know
isn't<00:02:28.160> ripping<00:02:28.700> open<00:02:28.849> completely<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:30.680> not

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
isn't ripping open completely it's not

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.589 
isn't ripping open completely it's not
going<00:02:31.400> anywhere<00:02:31.819> in<00:02:32.120> time<00:02:33.110> maybe<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.459> now

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
going anywhere in time maybe but for now

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.030 
going anywhere in time maybe but for now
they're<00:02:35.599> perfectly<00:02:36.050> fun<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.620> since<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
they're perfectly fun and since the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.229 
they're perfectly fun and since the
scheme<00:02:37.310> I've<00:02:37.519> been<00:02:37.730> getting<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.060> lot<00:02:38.180> better

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
scheme I've been getting a lot better

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.720 
scheme I've been getting a lot better
than<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.630> lot<00:02:38.660> better<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.590> don't<00:02:40.400> know<00:02:40.489> if

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
than a lot better and I don't know if

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.160 
than a lot better and I don't know if
everyone<00:02:41.060> gets<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> sea<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.019> me

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
everyone gets this but the sea with me

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.410 
everyone gets this but the sea with me
there's<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.440> transistor<00:02:43.010> II<00:02:43.220> period<00:02:43.549> who

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
there's this transistor II period who

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.059 
there's this transistor II period who
are<00:02:44.540> uh<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:46.660> still<00:02:47.660> was<00:02:48.170> sort<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> uncomfortable

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
are uh I still was sort of uncomfortable

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.860 
are uh I still was sort of uncomfortable
with<00:02:49.489> them<00:02:49.670> but<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.880> was<00:02:50.000> getting<00:02:50.120> good<00:02:50.450> scores

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
with them but I was getting good scores

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.750 
with them but I was getting good scores
I<00:02:51.049> haven't<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.530> haven't<00:02:51.980> become<00:02:52.400> fully

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
I haven't I haven't become fully

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.890 
I haven't I haven't become fully
comfortable<00:02:53.090> with<00:02:53.330> them<00:02:53.540> yet<00:02:53.720> they<00:02:53.750> still

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
comfortable with them yet they still

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.240 
comfortable with them yet they still
feel<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.319> little<00:02:54.410> weird<00:02:54.799> but<00:02:54.890> I've<00:02:55.099> been

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
feel a little weird but I've been

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.920 
feel a little weird but I've been
getting<00:02:55.519> much<00:02:55.760> better<00:02:55.970> scores<00:02:56.390> than<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.690> have

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
getting much better scores than I have

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.589 
getting much better scores than I have
in<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.400> game<00:02:58.549> play<00:02:59.000> and<00:03:00.459> um<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.880> was

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
in the in this game play and um I was

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.420 
in the in this game play and um I was
just<00:03:02.660> about<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.170> say<00:03:03.470> something<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.099> forgot

gonna<00:03:07.910> say<00:03:08.030> oh<00:03:08.360> yeah<00:03:08.599> it<00:03:09.110> seems<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:09.709> it's

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
gonna say oh yeah it seems like it's

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.339 
gonna say oh yeah it seems like it's
since<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.549> used<00:03:10.760> tactical<00:03:11.569> it's<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.930> lot<00:03:12.080> harder

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
since I used tactical it's a lot harder

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.640 
since I used tactical it's a lot harder
to<00:03:12.950> UM<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.540> B<00:03:14.720> button<00:03:14.900> tonight<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.590> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
to UM get to the B button tonight and it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.050 
to UM get to the B button tonight and it
would<00:03:15.799> be<00:03:15.829> with<00:03:16.310> am<00:03:17.410> with<00:03:18.410> uh<00:03:18.820> without<00:03:19.820> the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
would be with am with uh without the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.539 
would be with am with uh without the
control<00:03:20.510> freaks<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.019> it's<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.350> lot<00:03:21.709> lot<00:03:22.190> harder

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
control freaks and it's a lot lot harder

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.289 
control freaks and it's a lot lot harder
to<00:03:22.790> reload<00:03:23.209> manually<00:03:24.049> because<00:03:24.760> yet<00:03:25.760> son<00:03:26.060> it's

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
to reload manually because yet son it's

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.229 
to reload manually because yet son it's
a<00:03:26.359> much<00:03:26.600> greater<00:03:26.840> distance<00:03:27.380> from<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.970> top<00:03:29.209> of

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
a much greater distance from the top of

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.650 
a much greater distance from the top of
the<00:03:29.390> right<00:03:29.569> stick<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.019> X<00:03:30.260> or<00:03:31.160> square<00:03:31.730> than<00:03:32.540> it

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
the right stick to X or square than it

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.190 
the right stick to X or square than it
is<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:33.140> uh<00:03:33.170> than<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.859> is<00:03:33.980> without<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:35.200> control

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
is to uh than it is without the control

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.830 
is to uh than it is without the control
freaks<00:03:36.500> my<00:03:36.680> god<00:03:36.950> my<00:03:37.130> brains<00:03:37.340> thinking<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.840> huge

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
freaks my god my brains thinking it huge

speak you know and is it just me it was

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.330 
speak you know and is it just me it was
the<00:03:46.519> last<00:03:46.930> video<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.530> put<00:03:49.010> on<00:03:49.040> this

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the last video that I put on this

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.900 
the last video that I put on this
channel<00:03:49.639> also<00:03:50.239> unknown<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:51.400> think<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.519> was<00:03:52.549> i'll

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
channel also unknown I think it was i'll

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.879 
channel also unknown I think it was i'll
have<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.090> check<00:03:53.299> that<00:03:53.359> yeah<00:03:54.139> it<00:03:54.260> was<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.650> Dom

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
have to check that yeah it was on Dom

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.710 
have to check that yeah it was on Dom
yeah<00:03:55.340> cuz<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.760> last<00:03:55.940> one<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.120> put<00:03:56.329> on<00:03:56.420> here<00:03:56.600> was

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
yeah cuz the last one I put on here was
