00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.359
 friendly 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.960
 I do not know if Rome is part of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 your next destinations but the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.829
 Touring version of the Vespa GTS 300 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 offers a little vintage wink for 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.759
 a fun escapade this version 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.829
 touring takes over the base of the 300 gts 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.839
 with front and rear luggage doors 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.019
 foldable and a small enough windshield 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:44.850
 short this touring equipment gives a 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.230
 nice roman holiday air to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.970
 the eye 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.769
 for the rest we find the hull frame 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.620
 in steel dear to the mark since his 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.840
 origin in 1946 with even the old acronym 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.739
 piaggio and a signature gts on the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 crest of the fender before a vehicle 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.240
 which gives us a natural position on 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.910
 is sitting very straight with the fresh bust 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 right is not unpleasant a good 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.899
 management control luckily 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.899
 because it's a pretty direction 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.479
 heavy that engages a lot it gives a 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.450
 good maneuverability in town it's a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.800
 vehicle that would make products easily 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.289
 the engine is very responsive 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.459
 he quickly starts satin in one 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.880
 formidable live 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:34.099
 by combining maneuverability the weight is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.099
 a very powerful engine of 23 euros 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.030
 the virtually flat floor has 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 slip-resistant rubber slats and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.300
 can accommodate a bag with its hook 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.380
 of restraint las it opens 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.940
 electrically but our lodges 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.539
 virtually no jet helmets 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.399
 trade 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.069
 only small vespa jets will find 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.660
 place under the saddle you will find the 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.030
 fuel cap on the back and a 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.500
 salt rain cover the glove box 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.030
 opens by pushing the switch and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.030
 offers good storage space 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 1 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:14.760
 direction of a lack a little bit of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.450
 stability 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.450
 interview 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.129
 the vespa offers a beautiful 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.840
 vintage spirit instrumentation with a 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.909
 shows a gas gauge with indicator 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.799
 but little more control on the handlebars 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.569
 has justin cut contact right 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.700
 and the usual lighthouse inverter and 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.379
 flashing left 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.549
 pay attention to the side stand 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.260
 automatic which fold back on their own 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.970
 as soon as we correct the vespa 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.010
 just notice next to the crutch 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.049
 the anti-theft ring attached to the frame 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.819
 as for the center stand she 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.819
 is relatively easy to install 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.720
 however, the handle must be given 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.370
 wrist that serves the passage is 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.349
 properly installed with rests 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.849
 extractable feet with an elegant 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.849
 pendulum opening system 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.760
 in the end it's a bit like a vehicle 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.099
 which is very powerful 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.410
 a nice it is effective but who asks 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.770
 a certain habit of dosage in 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.660
 dawn the hostage 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.660
 all those are fascinating 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.379
 front stretched the back pc 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.099
 with the GT 300 is a real 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.650
 tool for the city and even more the 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.239
 style as a bonus the touring offers an air 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.160
 of dolce vita that is always raging 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.730
 associated with a modern engine 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.620
 efficient and pleasant effective cocktail 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.280
 and attractive once the instructions for use 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.280
 assimilated 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.750
 oddly so that's the best 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.580
 equipped with 300 gts it is also the least 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.390
 dear but we are already very close 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.390
 5000 euros
