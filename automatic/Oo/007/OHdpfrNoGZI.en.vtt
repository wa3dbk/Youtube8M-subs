got on a tree and now oh is it gonna

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.400 
got on a tree and now oh is it gonna
light<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.000> live<00:02:49.240> if<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:50.050> know<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.230> lag

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
light it see to live if you know the lag

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.730 
light it see to live if you know the lag
lets<00:02:50.620> me<00:02:50.709> find<00:02:50.920> out<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:52.150> running<00:02:52.360> backwards

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
lets me find out it's running backwards

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.510 
lets me find out it's running backwards
running<00:02:53.740> right<00:02:53.890> into<00:02:53.920> him<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.980> there<00:02:56.980> we<00:02:57.130> go<00:02:57.310> I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
running right into him and there we go I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.010 
running right into him and there we go I
think<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.150> really<00:02:58.180> couldn't<00:02:58.660> live<00:02:58.870> without

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
think it really couldn't live without

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.630 
think it really couldn't live without
the<00:02:59.320> rest<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.680> them<00:02:59.800> so<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.070> think<00:03:00.459> that's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the rest of them so I think that's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.190 
the rest of them so I think that's
pretty<00:03:01.060> much<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.390> i<00:03:01.660> think<00:03:01.720> i<00:03:01.870> don't<00:03:01.990> go<00:03:02.050> ahead

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
pretty much it i think i don't go ahead

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.370 
pretty much it i think i don't go ahead
and<00:03:02.290> look<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.620> stats<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:04.150> 108<00:03:04.900> half<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
and look at the stats so 108 half the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.170 
and look at the stats so 108 half the
match<00:03:05.680> did<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> fair<00:03:06.130> bit<00:03:06.160> about<00:03:06.640> 20<00:03:07.000> full

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
match did a fair bit about 20 full
