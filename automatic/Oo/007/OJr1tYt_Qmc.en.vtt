hey guys lucky spammer here um I

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.820 
hey guys lucky spammer here um I
previously<00:00:03.750> created<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.350> video<00:00:04.500> about

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
previously created a video about

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950 
previously created a video about
diagnosing<00:00:05.759> village<00:00:06.060> eNOS<00:00:06.390> from<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.779> network

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
diagnosing village eNOS from a network

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.410 
diagnosing village eNOS from a network
standpoint<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.730> decided<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.210> make<00:00:09.300> one

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
standpoint and I decided to make one

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.190 
standpoint and I decided to make one
about<00:00:09.960> diagnosing<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.860> glitch<00:00:11.040> eNOS<00:00:11.309> from<00:00:11.730> a

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
about diagnosing a glitch eNOS from a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.320 
about diagnosing a glitch eNOS from a
performance<00:00:13.200> or<00:00:13.380> graphics<00:00:14.309> standpoint<00:00:14.969> also

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
performance or graphics standpoint also

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
performance or graphics standpoint also
so<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.410> first<00:00:16.560> thing<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.130> is

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.670 
so the first thing we're going to do is
how<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> tell<00:00:17.970> if<00:00:18.109> you're<00:00:19.109> having<00:00:19.500> an<00:00:19.560> egg

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
how do you tell if you're having an egg

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.730 
how do you tell if you're having an egg
graphics<00:00:20.160> issue<00:00:20.310> well<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.480> FPS<00:00:22.140> stat<00:00:22.470> right

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
graphics issue well this FPS stat right

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.849 
graphics issue well this FPS stat right
here<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> top<00:00:23.400> left<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:24.060> that's<00:00:24.840> below<00:00:25.230> 60

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
here in the top left if that's below 60

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.720 
here in the top left if that's below 60
um<00:00:26.420> that's<00:00:27.420> potentially<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.439> lag<00:00:29.039> eNOS<00:00:29.429> or

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
um that's potentially a lag eNOS or

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.389 
um that's potentially a lag eNOS or
glitch<00:00:30.000> units<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.830> from<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.920> graphics

glitch units from from a graphics
rendering<00:00:32.669> standpoint<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> little

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

it's not going to be matter but it's not

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330

can<00:03:54.209> see<00:03:54.360> now<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.600> mine's<00:03:55.050> not<00:03:55.320> turned<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.800> it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
can see now that mine's not turned on it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.260 
can see now that mine's not turned on it
looks<00:03:56.190> like<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.550> this<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.790> how<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.150> should

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
looks like this this is how it should

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.940 
looks like this this is how it should
look<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.750> could<00:03:57.930> enable<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.800> would<00:03:58.920> be

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
look I could enable it but that would be

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.980 
look I could enable it but that would be
bad<00:03:59.250> because<00:03:59.490> then<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.180> wouldn't<00:04:00.390> use<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
bad because then it wouldn't use the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.860 
bad because then it wouldn't use the
hardware<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.620> accelerate<00:04:02.160> 2d<00:04:02.459> canvas<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.720> I'm

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
hardware to accelerate 2d canvas but I'm

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.630 
hardware to accelerate 2d canvas but I'm
guessing<00:04:04.050> most<00:04:04.620> likely<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.310> going<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.580> be

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
guessing most likely this is going to be

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.530 
guessing most likely this is going to be
the<00:04:05.730> case<00:04:05.880> yours<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.180> going<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.390> look<00:04:06.510> just

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
the case yours is going to look just

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.100 
the case yours is going to look just
like<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.340> but<00:04:08.340> what<00:04:08.520> you<00:04:08.640> can<00:04:08.850> do<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.390> right

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
like this but what you can do is right

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.940 
like this but what you can do is right
up<00:04:10.260> here<00:04:10.500> where<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:10.830> says<00:04:10.860> override<00:04:11.630> software

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
up here where it says override software

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.110 
up here where it says override software
rendering<00:04:13.950> list<00:04:15.020> this<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:17.100> enable<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
rendering list this you can enable and

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.849 
rendering list this you can enable and
in<00:04:18.480> all<00:04:18.600> likelihood<00:04:18.630> when<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.410> came<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:19.830> here

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
in all likelihood when you came in here

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.370 
in all likelihood when you came in here
it<00:04:20.370> looked<00:04:20.640> like<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.960> was<00:04:22.169> something

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
it looked like this this was something

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.770 
it looked like this this was something
that<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.650> could<00:04:22.950> enable<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.700> that's<00:04:24.630> what

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
that you could enable and that's what

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.850 
that you could enable and that's what
you<00:04:24.870> would<00:04:24.990> want<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:25.200> do<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.440> would<00:04:25.560> want<00:04:25.710> to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
you would want to do you would want to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.469 
you would want to do you would want to
enable<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.430> ability<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:26.849> override<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
software or injury list and what this

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.409

will<00:04:30.360> do<00:04:30.599> is<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.710> will<00:04:31.740> even<00:04:32.250> if<00:04:32.460> your<00:04:32.669> if<00:04:33.060> you

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
will do is it will even if your if you

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.999 
will do is it will even if your if you

have a graphics card even if it's black
listed<00:04:35.430> at<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.639> moment<00:04:36.030> chrome<00:04:36.240> will<00:04:36.419> attempt

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
to use it anyways and a lot of cases

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.330 
to use it anyways and a lot of cases
it's<00:04:39.539> absolutely<00:04:39.750> fine<00:04:40.379> to<00:04:40.439> do<00:04:40.770> that<00:04:40.979> but<00:04:41.250> if

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
it's absolutely fine to do that but if

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.760 
it's absolutely fine to do that but if
you<00:04:41.460> experience<00:04:41.909> a<00:04:42.120> lot<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.419> crashes<00:04:42.770> you'll

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
you experience a lot of crashes you'll

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.379 
you experience a lot of crashes you'll
want<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.009> go<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.340> switch<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:44.939> it<00:04:45.240> will

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
want to go and switch it but it will

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.809 
want to go and switch it but it will
probably<00:04:45.629> buy<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.169> some<00:04:46.919> frames<00:04:47.189> per<00:04:47.430> second

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
probably buy you some frames per second

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.809 
probably buy you some frames per second
and<00:04:47.909> chrome<00:04:48.590> if<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.830> if<00:04:50.159> you<00:04:50.340> turn<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.759> on

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
and chrome if you if you turn that on

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.480 
and chrome if you if you turn that on
and<00:04:51.439> you<00:04:52.439> weren't<00:04:52.680> any<00:04:52.979> more<00:04:53.189> software

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
and you weren't any more software

and you weren't any more software
accelerated<00:04:54.090> before<00:04:54.389> now<00:04:54.539> after<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:55.020> turn<00:04:55.229> it

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
accelerated before now after you turn it

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.800 
accelerated before now after you turn it
on<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:56.610> will<00:04:56.759> need<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:57.090> come<00:04:57.270> down<00:04:57.300> here<00:04:57.449> and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
on you will need to come down here and

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.899 
on you will need to come down here and
relaunch<00:04:58.379> and<00:04:58.710> see<00:04:59.400> if<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.639> makes<00:04:59.759> a

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
relaunch and see if it makes a

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.379 
relaunch and see if it makes a
difference<00:04:59.939> for<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.629> and<00:05:01.669> in<00:05:02.669> google<00:05:03.270> chrome

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
difference for you and in google chrome

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.990 
difference for you and in google chrome
now<00:05:04.229> i<00:05:04.590> also<00:05:04.949> want<00:05:05.189> to<00:05:05.219> mention<00:05:05.279> just<00:05:05.669> because

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
now i also want to mention just because

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.820 
now i also want to mention just because
your<00:05:06.180> graphics<00:05:06.629> card<00:05:06.689> is<00:05:07.020> blacklisted<00:05:07.469> now

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
your graphics card is blacklisted now

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.890 
your graphics card is blacklisted now
doesn't<00:05:08.189> mean<00:05:08.279> it<00:05:08.430> always<00:05:08.580> be<00:05:08.909> blacklisted<00:05:09.509> I

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
doesn't mean it always be blacklisted I

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.059 
doesn't mean it always be blacklisted I
mean<00:05:10.050> every<00:05:10.319> chrome<00:05:10.620> release<00:05:11.039> more<00:05:12.710> GPUs<00:05:13.710> are

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
mean every chrome release more GPUs are

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.149 
mean every chrome release more GPUs are
white<00:05:15.060> listed<00:05:15.569> so<00:05:16.439> it's<00:05:16.590> also<00:05:16.740> something<00:05:17.039> you

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
white listed so it's also something you

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.399 
white listed so it's also something you
could<00:05:17.400> just<00:05:17.520> wait<00:05:17.819> on<00:05:17.849> and<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.779> might<00:05:18.960> get<00:05:19.259> it

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
could just wait on and you might get it

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.290 
could just wait on and you might get it
eventually<00:05:19.650> but<00:05:20.460> anyways<00:05:20.759> those<00:05:21.060> are<00:05:21.090> my<00:05:21.240> tips

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
eventually but anyways those are my tips

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.559 
eventually but anyways those are my tips
for<00:05:21.750> potentially<00:05:23.090> increasing<00:05:24.090> your<00:05:24.300> frames

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
for potentially increasing your frames

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:25.760 
for potentially increasing your frames
per<00:05:24.750> second<00:05:25.110> if<00:05:25.169> you're<00:05:25.319> having<00:05:25.469> that<00:05:25.650> issue

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
per second if you're having that issue

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.460 
per second if you're having that issue
hope<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.370> helps
