audio on both sounds the same as the 3
g's<00:03:00.200> earpiece<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.280> that's<00:03:01.489> pretty<00:03:01.850> good

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
g's earpiece so that's pretty good

g's earpiece so that's pretty good
outgoing<00:03:04.060> audio<00:03:05.060> on<00:03:05.420> both<00:03:05.989> sounds<00:03:06.470> quite

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
outgoing audio on both sounds quite

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.770 
outgoing audio on both sounds quite
similar<00:03:07.190> also<00:03:07.670> it's<00:03:07.910> excellent<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.510> both<00:03:08.540> of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
similar also it's excellent on both of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.880 
similar also it's excellent on both of
them<00:03:09.140> now<00:03:10.150> both<00:03:11.150> blueant<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:12.170> jawbone

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
them now both blueant and jawbone

with<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.019> test<00:03:18.640> basically<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.910> recorded<00:03:20.900> my

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
with a test basically I recorded my

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.110 
with a test basically I recorded my
vacuum<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.799> played<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.100> back<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.459> my<00:03:22.610> stereo

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
vacuum and played it back on my stereo

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.080 
vacuum and played it back on my stereo
at<00:03:23.299> 75<00:03:23.840> decibels<00:03:24.340> that's<00:03:25.340> pretty<00:03:25.519> loud<00:03:25.820> that's

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
at 75 decibels that's pretty loud that's

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.940 
at 75 decibels that's pretty loud that's
pretty<00:03:26.420> much<00:03:26.570> what<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> vacuum<00:03:27.320> sounds<00:03:27.739> like

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
pretty much what the vacuum sounds like

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.890 
pretty much what the vacuum sounds like
when<00:03:28.220> you're<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> couple<00:03:28.820> feet<00:03:28.970> away<00:03:29.030> from<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.720> I

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
when you're a couple feet away from it I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.759 
when you're a couple feet away from it I
found<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:31.040> blueant<00:03:31.450> could<00:03:32.450> not<00:03:32.630> cope<00:03:33.200> with<00:03:33.530> it

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
found the blueant could not cope with it

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.250 
found the blueant could not cope with it
did<00:03:34.040> not<00:03:34.160> cope<00:03:34.489> well<00:03:34.790> with<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.299> vacuum<00:03:35.510> unless

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
did not cope well with the vacuum unless

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.530 
did not cope well with the vacuum unless
I<00:03:36.440> talked<00:03:37.160> in<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.519> louder<00:03:37.820> voice<00:03:37.970> than<00:03:38.150> I'm

when there's a lot of noise which would

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.130 
when there's a lot of noise which would
I<00:04:08.130> pick<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.700> think<00:04:09.360> I'd<00:04:09.480> go<00:04:09.630> with<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> Prime

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
I pick I think I'd go with the Prime

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.050 
I pick I think I'd go with the Prime
just<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.070> does<00:04:11.280> better<00:04:11.520> when<00:04:11.850> there's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
just because it does better when there's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.720 
just because it does better when there's
a<00:04:12.120> lot<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.360> background<00:04:12.720> noise<00:04:13.260> but<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.550> hard

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
a lot of background noise but it's hard

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.910
