00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.460
 Welcome people are welcome to 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.580
 one more video and this video will be the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.090
 gtx 550 ti test and together with the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.610
 My, I got it again, it's fs 300. 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.920
 Let's see what difference it made to 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.240
 a former frame and no I already advance that not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.840
 It makes no difference when people 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 plays here in the womb since before he already 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.020
 I used 99% of the video card I am 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.630
 doing in bar 3 for now because the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.370
 r4 does not support others to have bandwidth 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 so there's no way we can do it there 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 on the use of the video card and these 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.920
 others 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 these other things show you 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.980
 How are you playing? I 'm playing. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 now in ultra in 1600 by 900 that the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.629
 resolution on the monitor you want after 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.329
 I do in full hd and why the leak 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.899
 would have to go through the living room television 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.789
 I'm doing here in the tournament and now 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.719
 what are you going to do and will you give a pain here in the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.180
 map and will show it to you is the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.820
 as it is reduced from what happened 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.330
 before with effects 4 and without before when 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.820
 I said the graphics of the fs 4 100 is what 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.970
 happened was that the use of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.720
 video was very low and gave me a fs 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.670
 below 60 this is one thing that is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.000
 that the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.979
 processor it can not use 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.460
 so in a game itself is the time of a 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:43.079
 drop in a way that happened is 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 the downloaded only just lowering there 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.650
 and the graph will do the same 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.650
 now with ecs and 300 efe and we will do 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.799
 a comparison then put 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.130
 now that you will continue with the same 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.009
 resolution and we'll see how it goes 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:11.299
 be the percentage of use and 90% and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.299
 50 and 60 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 very cool the quality of the game too 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.739
 It's very cool. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.959
 running above 60 fps then you already know 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:35.840
 that is very good 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:38.519
 so if you want to run 1 to 3 and now 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.919
 will lower more is that the vote chart 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.540
 in the middle promote what will happen 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:49.949
 3rd use of a drop more eyes of the frames 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.019
 are at 70 80 ips seldom 60 km and it is 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.989
 That's what I wanted people because 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.689
 When I'm recording the video I need 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.359
 of frames up there and before with my 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.919
 room I could not do it because he 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.669
 gave a small gala and when people 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.439
 put a low chart then in time 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:14.730
 to record the videos when I wanted to 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:19.019
 record there wasnt much better there 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.439
 30 and now I can bring the gameplay 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.129
 much better is better quality for you 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:28.589
 another thing is that in bs-4 and also goes 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.489
 happen the same way 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:38.449
 I just do not know how that is and how big it is. 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:42.510
 this happens is because the msf 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:44.760
 Watching what I'm going to say now 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.919
 on the spot than before when people 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.239
 put normal is using a stand 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:55.139
 playpen I know there 60 is 30% of the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.389
 video or 40% and it gave me a ridiculous frame 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.689
 I do not know who remembers there but this 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:04.979
 I could not play a 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:06.239
 crazy with a in case above that fps 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.909
 and now I get 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.389
 now I'm getting a good movie there 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.020
 cool to play and to record the same 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:19.070
 You're not recording now. 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.040
 but you know that now a person 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.020
 who can tell he was smart and 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.560
 He can 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.680
 Behind him the church is operating 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:38.900
 I already got it 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:41.150
 at 35 he might by then it was bad is it 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:50.720
 guys is this was a video I wanted 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:54.020
 bring you more to myself here 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.410
 It was more back and middle I wanted 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:05.110
 show you that with this one now with 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:07.820
 this my new and new moon new 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.960
 church processors in the case of 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.970
 configuration 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:22.030
 you can play much better if you almost 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:24.440
 taken one minute and was not so 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.530
 so I wanted to show you what now 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.530
 I 'll be able to bring the gameplay that is 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.360
 above 60 frames per second equal 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.050
 when I did a comparison test with 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.300
 4 100 and with 45 you remember but the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.690
 Maritime also giving even giving even 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.460
 than the fc of 300 is you get a 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.580
 movie much higher it as it was 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.490
 no Islam ran with 4 and 6 4 and without 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.370
 walk ahead but far below 60 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.040
 fps even annual that showed the bottleneck 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.710
 that he brought to play and went 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.340
 run over now the guys got 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.000
 video, thanks, and I'll bring the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.410
 performance you something in bs-4 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.410
 This is a hug and thanks
