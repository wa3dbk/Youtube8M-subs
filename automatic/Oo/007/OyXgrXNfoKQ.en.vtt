00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you're gonna start off with a flush

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.270 
you're gonna start off with a flush
colored<00:00:33.930> piece<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.290> clay<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> you're<00:00:35.010> going

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
colored piece of clay and you're going

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
colored piece of clay and you're going
to<00:00:35.460> flatten<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.000> into<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> shape<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> cookie

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to flatten this into a shape of a cookie

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
to flatten this into a shape of a cookie
all<00:00:37.680> you're<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.219> doing<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.850> making<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
all you're really doing is making a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.139 
all you're really doing is making a
circle<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.860> does<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.219> need<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> perfect

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
circle it does not need to be perfect

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
circle it does not need to be perfect
because<00:00:42.270> cookies<00:00:42.899> usually<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.680> organic

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
because cookies usually have an organic

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
because cookies usually have an organic
shape<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.579> begin<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.660> add

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
shape to begin with and we're gonna add

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.860 
shape to begin with and we're gonna add
a<00:00:45.960> few<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.460> textures<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
a few more different textures to make it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
a few more different textures to make it
look<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.230> realistic<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.340> I'm<00:00:50.520> using<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
look more realistic so I'm using is a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240 
look more realistic so I'm using is a
back<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> paintbrush<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
back of a paintbrush but you can use a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.400 
back of a paintbrush but you can use a
crumpled<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:53.969> piece<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.329> foil<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:55.050> sandpaper

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
crumpled up piece of foil or sandpaper

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.560 
crumpled up piece of foil or sandpaper
whatever<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.969> give<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
whatever you like to do to give it a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
whatever you like to do to give it a
really<00:00:57.809> good<00:00:58.109> texture<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.640> with

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
really good texture as you can see with

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
really good texture as you can see with
texture<00:01:00.300> alone<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.870> already<00:01:01.140> looks<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
texture alone it already looks like a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.340 
texture alone it already looks like a
more<00:01:02.100> realistic<00:01:02.489> cookie<00:01:03.030> alright<00:01:03.960> let's<00:01:04.170> give

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
make sure you make the edges of the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
make sure you make the edges of the
cookie<00:01:13.740> darker<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> cookie

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
cookie darker because when a cookie

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
cookie darker because when a cookie
bakes<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.439> edges<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:17.040> actually<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
bakes the edges are actually a little

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
bakes the edges are actually a little
more<00:01:18.030> burnt<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> rest<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> Sun<00:01:19.530> or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
more burnt than the rest of the Sun or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
more burnt than the rest of the Sun or
cookie<00:01:20.330> coloring<00:01:21.330> makes<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.659> huge<00:01:21.900> difference

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
cookie coloring makes a huge difference

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929

so<00:01:22.590> even<00:01:22.979> though<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.159> doesn't<00:01:23.310> look<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.729> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so even though it doesn't look like it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
so even though it doesn't look like it's
done<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.360> compared<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:25.619> not

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
done much compared to one that's not

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.469 
done much compared to one that's not
colored<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> looks<00:01:26.850> much<00:01:27.180> more

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
colored you can see it looks much more

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
colored you can see it looks much more
