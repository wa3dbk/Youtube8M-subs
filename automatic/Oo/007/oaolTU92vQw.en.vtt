animals<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.120> set<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.660> way<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:36.930> that's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
animals are set up that way and that's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
animals are set up that way and that's
for<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> exclusive<00:00:38.370> intention<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.000> being

for the exclusive intention of being
able<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.960> detect<00:00:40.410> predators<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:41.730> very<00:00:42.030> cute

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
able to detect predators they very cute

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510 
able to detect predators they very cute
hearing<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:43.260> need<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> detect<00:00:43.980> where<00:00:44.340> those

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
hearing they need to detect where those

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
hearing they need to detect where those
predators<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.510> example<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.620> our

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
predators are for example and in our

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
predators are for example and in our
case<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.280> represent<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> predator<00:00:48.719> when

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
case we represent the predator when

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
case we represent the predator when
we're<00:00:49.140> working<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.829> therefore<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
we're working with them therefore we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
we're working with them therefore we
need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> limit<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> amount<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.140> hooting<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
need to limit the amount of hooting and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.260 
need to limit the amount of hooting and
hollering<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.489> yelling<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.120> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
hollering and yelling and just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.299 
hollering and yelling and just
disruption<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.469> give<00:00:55.649> those<00:00:55.860> animals

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
disruption that we give those animals

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
disruption that we give those animals
because<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.760> very<00:00:56.940> disturbing<00:00:57.649> also<00:00:58.649> making

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
because it's very disturbing also making

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.160 
because it's very disturbing also making
very<00:00:59.190> fast<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.879> abrupt<00:01:00.210> movements<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
very fast and abrupt movements is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.750 
very fast and abrupt movements is
something<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.859> detect<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.489> easily

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
something that they detect very easily

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
something that they detect very easily
so<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.420> work<00:01:03.660> phenols<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.710> do

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so when you work phenols you really do

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.539 
so when you work phenols you really do
need<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> remain<00:01:05.580> calm<00:01:06.740> they<00:01:07.740> also<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
need to remain calm they also have a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.450 
need to remain calm they also have a
flight<00:01:08.939> zone<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.560> safety<00:01:11.010> zone<00:01:11.040> an

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
flight zone it is the safety zone an

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
flight zone it is the safety zone an
animal<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.060> keep<00:01:12.240> between<00:01:12.420> itself<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
animal will keep between itself and a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.370 
animal will keep between itself and a
person<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.799> another<00:01:14.159> animal<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> size<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
person or another animal the size of the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
person or another animal the size of the
flight<00:01:16.619> zone<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> determined<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> cattles

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
flight zone is determined by the cattles

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
flight zone is determined by the cattles
experience<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.110> people<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.729> been

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
experience with people if they have been

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
experience with people if they have been
around<00:01:21.090> people<00:01:21.390> who<00:01:21.780> interacted<00:01:22.500> favorably

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
around people who interacted favorably

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
around people who interacted favorably
with<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> small<00:01:24.600> flight

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
with them they will have a small flight

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499 
with them they will have a small flight
zone<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.460> been<00:01:26.640> pasture<00:01:27.119> animals

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
zone if they have been pasture animals

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
zone if they have been pasture animals
with<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.110> exposure<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.650> humans<00:01:29.159> they

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
with a little exposure to humans they

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.850 
with a little exposure to humans they
will<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.060> highly<00:01:30.450> suspicious<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.259> their

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
will be highly suspicious and their

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.730 
will be highly suspicious and their
flight<00:01:32.130> zone<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.729> large<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:34.229> means<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
flight zone will be large this means a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
flight zone will be large this means a
person<00:01:34.979> can't<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.640> too<00:01:35.880> close<00:01:36.180> before<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
person can't get too close before the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
when the animal slows down you go back

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.120 
when the animal slows down you go back
and<00:02:48.959> put<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.200> more<00:02:49.530> pressure<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
and put a little more pressure on the

now<00:02:51.360> here's<00:02:51.600> an<00:02:51.750> example<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.470> person<00:02:52.860> who

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
now here's an example of a person who

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.190 
now here's an example of a person who
got<00:02:53.130> too<00:02:53.459> close<00:02:53.820> he's<00:02:54.300> running<00:02:54.690> some<00:02:54.840> cattle

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
got too close he's running some cattle

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.590 
got too close he's running some cattle
down<00:02:55.350> an<00:02:55.500> alley<00:02:55.770> they<00:02:56.310> start<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.730> turn<00:02:56.910> back<00:02:57.180> so

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
down an alley they start to turn back so

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.880 
down an alley they start to turn back so
he<00:02:57.720> makes<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> mistake<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.260> running<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.740> there

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
he makes the mistake of running up there

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.010 
he makes the mistake of running up there
on<00:02:59.010> top<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.340> them<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.550> just<00:02:59.840> getting<00:03:00.840> too

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
on top of them and just getting too

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.590 
on top of them and just getting too
close<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:02.340> why<00:03:02.550> did<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.790> cow<00:03:02.970> turn<00:03:03.360> back

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
close and why did the cow turn back

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.110 
close and why did the cow turn back
because<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.800> get<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.130> man<00:03:05.400> out<00:03:05.730> of

proper handling techniques to both sort
and<00:03:56.760> load<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.209> cattle

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.430 

now<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.730> also<00:04:01.150> need<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.570> look<00:04:01.750> at<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.960> diagram

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
now you also need to look at the diagram

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.140 
now you also need to look at the diagram
and<00:04:02.650> see<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.040> you've<00:04:03.160> got<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.310> point<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.910> balance

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and see it you've got a point of balance

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.540 
and see it you've got a point of balance
at<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.570> shoulder<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.380> is<00:04:05.590> really<00:04:05.950> important

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
at the shoulder this is really important

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.790 
at the shoulder this is really important
if<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:07.300> are<00:04:07.480> behind<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.200> point<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.590> balance

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
if you are behind the point of balance

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.920 
if you are behind the point of balance
at<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.190> shoulder<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:10.060> animal<00:04:10.540> will<00:04:10.750> go

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
at the shoulder the animal will go

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.080 
at the shoulder the animal will go
forward<00:04:11.290> if<00:04:11.590> you're<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:12.160> front<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.850> point

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
forward if you're in front of the point

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.000 
forward if you're in front of the point
of<00:04:13.180> balance<00:04:13.390> at<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.750> shoulder<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.470> will<00:04:14.860> go

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
of balance at the shoulder it will go

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.610 
of balance at the shoulder it will go
