 we leave like this we give you next 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.979
 I always use this option because 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.840
 because remove these options in the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.869
 which are only advertisements for the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.280

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.390
 what is this removed all these options 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.390
 of monex 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 and there begins to install 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.490
 we wait for him to install 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.700
 by the way it is always going to install in 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.370
 English language in everything we do is 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.860
 modify it to the Spanish language that 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 after who does not install it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.910
 appear the languages ​​that you can 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.130
 well then placed choose Spanish 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.790
 which is like in the third option 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.739

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.370
