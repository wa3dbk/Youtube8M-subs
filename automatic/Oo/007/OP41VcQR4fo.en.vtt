be the option for you now firstly Angela
a<00:00:27.779> question<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.470> before<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> step<00:00:29.160> into<00:00:29.310> my

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
a question to you before I step into my

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.880 
a question to you before I step into my
pool<00:00:29.760> party<00:00:29.939> over<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.390> why<00:00:31.230> exactly<00:00:31.470> would

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
pool party over here why exactly would

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.370 
pool party over here why exactly would
one<00:00:32.070> choose<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> water<00:00:32.790> birth<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.719> enhances

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
one choose a water birth it enhances

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.069 
one choose a water birth it enhances
natural<00:00:34.829> birthing<00:00:35.219> water<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.210> very<00:00:36.420> relaxing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
natural birthing water is very relaxing

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110 
natural birthing water is very relaxing
so<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.620> means<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.280> body<00:00:38.309> works<00:00:38.879> more

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so it means that your body works more

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.299 
so it means that your body works more
effectively<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> makes<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> labor

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
effectively and so it makes the labor

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
effectively and so it makes the labor
quicker<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> less<00:00:42.180> painful<00:00:42.480> okay<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.620> think

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
quicker and less painful okay so I think

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
quicker and less painful okay so I think
the<00:00:44.040> next<00:00:44.219> step<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the next step is we're actually going to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.750 
the next step is we're actually going to
have<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.899> getting<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.190> pool<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.730> now
