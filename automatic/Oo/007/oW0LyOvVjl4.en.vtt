something going on what's happening well
we've<00:00:19.170> taken<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.800> next<00:00:19.920> level<00:00:20.220> it

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
we've taken it to the next level it

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.250 
we've taken it to the next level it
started<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> product<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.140> we

first<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.219> what<00:00:53.219> does<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> thing<00:00:53.610> start

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
first of all what does this thing start

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.959 
first of all what does this thing start
off<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:55.170> based<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.739> GM's<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.579> l80

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
off as it's based on GM's for l80

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
off as it's based on GM's for l80
transmission<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.530> basically<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> truck

if I want to to really monkey with it
myself<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.239> want<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.510> dial<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.080> my<00:03:05.200> own

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
myself and I want to dial in my own

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.820 
myself and I want to dial in my own
shift<00:03:05.650> points<00:03:06.010> firmness

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
shift points firmness

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.670 
shift points firmness
and<00:03:07.100> maybe<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.180> want<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> have<00:03:08.540> multiple<00:03:08.720> shift

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
and maybe I want to have multiple shift

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.410 
and maybe I want to have multiple shift
strategies<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.490> all<00:03:10.610> possible<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.240> think

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
strategies that all possible that think

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.980 
strategies that all possible that think
so

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
so

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.690 
so
it<00:03:12.170> absolutely<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:13.190> took<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.490> into

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
it absolutely is we took that into

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.180 
it absolutely is we took that into
consideration<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:14.690> guys<00:03:14.900> must<00:03:15.350> customize

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
consideration some guys must customize

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.070 
consideration some guys must customize
and<00:03:16.490> do<00:03:16.580> their<00:03:16.730> own<00:03:16.790> tuning<00:03:17.240> so<00:03:17.510> it's

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
and do their own tuning so it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.050 
and do their own tuning so it's
perfectly<00:03:18.620> capable<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:19.310> doing<00:03:19.610> it<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.880> an

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
perfectly capable of doing it as an

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.580 
perfectly capable of doing it as an
elaborate<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.660> tune<00:03:20.900> or<00:03:21.110> custom

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.190 
in there and customize it all you want
so<00:03:25.520> there's<00:03:25.790> kind<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.120> paradigm<00:03:26.570> with<00:03:26.900> with

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
so there's kind of a paradigm with with

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.010 
so there's kind of a paradigm with with
high<00:03:27.320> performance<00:03:27.530> transmissions<00:03:28.490> because

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
high performance transmissions because

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.690 
high performance transmissions because
you<00:03:30.020> know<00:03:30.110> they're<00:03:30.530> built<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.830> withstand<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
you know they're built to withstand a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.210 
you know they're built to withstand a
lot<00:03:31.850> but<00:03:32.210> things<00:03:32.870> happen<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.830> know<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:33.980> never

going to stand behind it well that's a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.170 
going to stand behind it well that's a
transmission<00:03:48.680> they<00:03:49.550> take<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> lot<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.000> abuse

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
transmission they take a lot of abuse

last<00:04:00.710> question<00:04:00.800> about<00:04:01.250> these<00:04:02.590> from<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.680> builder

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
last question about these from a builder

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.100 
last question about these from a builder
standpoint<00:04:04.640> just<00:04:05.420> because<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.900> bolt

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
standpoint just because you can bolt

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.430 
standpoint just because you can bolt
this<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.800> Ford<00:04:07.130> or<00:04:07.310> Mopar<00:04:07.790> or<00:04:07.910> what<00:04:08.030> have<00:04:08.240> you

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
this to a Ford or Mopar or what have you

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.199 
this to a Ford or Mopar or what have you
do<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.040> have<00:04:10.250> any<00:04:10.430> ballpark<00:04:11.680> comparisons<00:04:12.680> on

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
do you have any ballpark comparisons on

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.690 
do you have any ballpark comparisons on
like<00:04:14.209> trans<00:04:14.540> tunnel<00:04:14.780> sizes<00:04:15.470> as<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:16.040> fitting

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
like trans tunnel sizes as to fitting

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.030 
like trans tunnel sizes as to fitting
the<00:04:16.820> rest<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.299> trans<00:04:17.570> in<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.900> car<00:04:18.109> well

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
the rest of the trans in the car well

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.979 
the rest of the trans in the car well
the<00:04:20.000> good<00:04:20.209> news<00:04:20.270> is<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.660> these

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
the good news is that these

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.750 
the good news is that these
transmissions<00:04:21.770> are<00:04:21.950> basically<00:04:22.310> all<00:04:22.520> about

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
transmissions are basically all about

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.850 
transmissions are basically all about
the<00:04:22.910> same<00:04:23.120> shape<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.660> since<00:04:24.169> this<00:04:24.320> is<00:04:24.500> really

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
the same shape and since this is really

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.070 
the same shape and since this is really
in<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.400> four-speed<00:04:25.970> skinned<00:04:26.390> it<00:04:26.540> was<00:04:26.660> based<00:04:26.900> on

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
in a four-speed skinned it was based on

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.260 
in a four-speed skinned it was based on
a<00:04:27.140> four-speed<00:04:27.680> transmission<00:04:27.980> you<00:04:28.790> don't<00:04:29.060> get

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
a four-speed transmission you don't get

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.330 
a four-speed transmission you don't get
the<00:04:29.450> girth<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> extra<00:04:30.440> size<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:31.070> some<00:04:31.310> of

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
the girth in the extra size of some of

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.570 
the girth in the extra size of some of
the<00:04:31.520> OE<00:04:31.730> six<00:04:32.360> beats<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:32.990> as<00:04:33.740> far<00:04:33.919> as<00:04:33.980> fitment<00:04:34.460> I

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
the OE six beats so as far as fitment I

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.370 
the OE six beats so as far as fitment I
don't<00:04:34.760> think<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.030> can<00:04:35.180> beat<00:04:35.390> this<00:04:35.600> awesome

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
don't think you can beat this awesome

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.950 
don't think you can beat this awesome
very<00:04:36.919> cool<00:04:37.010> well<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.360> look<00:04:38.510> forward<00:04:38.750> to
