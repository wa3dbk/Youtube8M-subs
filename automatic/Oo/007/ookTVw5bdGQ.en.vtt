00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
hundred percent sure that is the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.210 
hundred percent sure that is the
announcer<00:05:05.870> voice<00:05:06.260> I've<00:05:06.470> looked<00:05:06.710> at<00:05:06.830> different

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
announcer voice I've looked at different

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.400 
announcer voice I've looked at different
videos<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.880> is<00:05:08.030> how<00:05:08.210> they<00:05:08.419> do<00:05:08.990> it<00:05:09.199> I

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
videos and this is how they do it I

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.180 
videos and this is how they do it I
guess<00:05:09.639> this<00:05:10.639> is<00:05:10.789> how<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.590> thing<00:05:12.590> gets<00:05:12.830> fixed

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
guess this is how the thing gets fixed

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.129 
guess this is how the thing gets fixed
