County California we're down with this

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
County California we're down with this
truck<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.940> brought<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> road<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
truck that was brought it on the road to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.570 
truck that was brought it on the road to
show<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> public<00:00:16.410> exactly<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.279> oakley<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
show the public exactly what oakley is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
show the public exactly what oakley is
all<00:00:17.760> about<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:18.690> set<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.990> testing

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
all about so this first set of testing

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.390 
all about so this first set of testing
we're<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> deal

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we're going to do here is going to deal

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
we're going to do here is going to deal
with<00:00:20.490> optics<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.510> tests<00:00:21.930> are

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
with optics and all these tests are

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.269 
with optics and all these tests are
designed<00:00:22.109> around<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.650> American<00:00:23.130> National

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
designed around the American National

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.950 
designed around the American National
Standards<00:00:23.490> Institute<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.840> very

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
Standards Institute you know it's very

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630 
Standards Institute you know it's very
important<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.439> sunglasses<00:00:26.099> are<00:00:26.220> tested

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
important that sunglasses are tested

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.950 
important that sunglasses are tested
that<00:00:26.789> way<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.689> kind<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
that way they can have some kind of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
that way they can have some kind of
performance<00:00:28.590> standards<00:00:29.070> some<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> things

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
performance standards some of the things

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.490 
performance standards some of the things
are<00:00:29.880> important<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> optics<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.289> these

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
are important to optics is that these

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990 
are important to optics is that these
glasses<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> protect<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.759> from

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
glasses are going to protect you from

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
glasses are going to protect you from
harmful<00:00:33.540> visible<00:00:34.079> light<00:00:34.290> set<00:00:34.559> off<00:00:34.649> by<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> Sun

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
harmful visible light set off by the Sun

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
harmful visible light set off by the Sun
I'm<00:00:35.399> lucky<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.640> he<00:00:35.730> does<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.090> actually<00:00:36.239> burns

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I'm lucky if he does is actually burns

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
I'm lucky if he does is actually burns
your<00:00:37.050> cornea<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.739> retina<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.160> eye

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
your cornea or your retina of your eye

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.590 
your cornea or your retina of your eye
causing<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.910> eventually<00:00:39.270> develop

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
causing you to eventually develop

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
causing you to eventually develop
diseases<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.200> things<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.829> that's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
diseases and things like that so that's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
diseases and things like that so that's
very<00:00:41.460> important<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.030> test<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.629> this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
very important so they test on that this

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.270 
very important so they test on that this
first<00:00:43.320> test<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> be

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
first test right here is going to be

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
first test right here is going to be
laser<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.420> replicates<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.050> how

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
laser and what this replicates is how

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
laser and what this replicates is how
light<00:00:46.590> travels<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.520> focal<00:00:47.700> point<00:00:47.879> into

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
light travels from a focal point into

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
light travels from a focal point into
your<00:00:48.539> ocular<00:00:48.840> cavities<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.280> we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
your ocular cavities so right here we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.740 
your ocular cavities so right here we
have<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.610> elder<00:00:50.879> son<00:00:51.030> head<00:00:51.149> form<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
have an elder son head form which is the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.209 
have an elder son head form which is the
average<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.320> headphones<00:00:52.770> across<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
average of all headphones across the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
average of all headphones across the
world<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.300> headphone<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.780> have

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
world and with this headphone we have

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
world and with this headphone we have
two<00:00:55.050> eyes<00:00:55.230> these<00:00:55.949> two<00:00:56.160> eyes<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:56.760> lasers

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
two eyes these two eyes have two lasers

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.250 
two eyes these two eyes have two lasers
coming<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> them<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> look<00:00:58.079> down

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
coming out of them if you look down

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
coming out of them if you look down
there<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.710> see<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.190> laser<00:00:59.430> on<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
there you can see that one laser on that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
there you can see that one laser on that
chart<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.100> walk<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.550> here

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
chart right there as I walk down here

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.009 
chart right there as I walk down here
you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.090> these<00:01:03.210> two<00:01:03.420> paths<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.809> light

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you can see these two paths of light

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140 
you can see these two paths of light
right<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.070> paths<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> light<00:01:05.820> come

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
right here these two paths of light come

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.590 
right here these two paths of light come
together<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.460> focal<00:01:08.880> point<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
together at one focal point so this is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.940 
together at one focal point so this is
how<00:01:09.720> our<00:01:09.750> eyes<00:01:10.020> work<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> common

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
how our eyes work and the common

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.289 
how our eyes work and the common
problems<00:01:11.280> start<00:01:11.490> off<00:01:11.610> basically<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
problems start off basically with the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
problems start off basically with the
design<00:01:12.860> sunglasses<00:01:13.860> over<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> years<00:01:14.580> have

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
design sunglasses over the years have

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
design sunglasses over the years have
evolved<00:01:15.210> into<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.840> cool<00:01:16.200> rap<00:01:16.530> shapes<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
evolved into these cool rap shapes the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
evolved into these cool rap shapes the
problem<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:17.970> rap<00:01:18.299> creates<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.750> curved

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
problem is the rap creates a curved

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.600 
problem is the rap creates a curved
surface<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.590> curved<00:01:19.860> lens<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.369> light<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
surface or curved lens for light to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
surface or curved lens for light to
travel<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.320> flat

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
travel through we all know that a flat

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
travel through we all know that a flat
plane<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> glass<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> travel

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
plane and glass will like to travel

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.429 
plane and glass will like to travel
straight<00:01:24.600> through<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:24.960> once<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> put<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
straight through but once you put a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.260 
straight through but once you put a
curve<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.979> surface<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> bend

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

for<00:02:07.700> those<00:02:07.910> problems<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:08.960> still<00:02:09.140> have<00:02:09.200> that

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
for those problems so we still have that

or<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.360> call<00:02:11.510> rake<00:02:11.750> but<00:02:12.620> at<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.710> same<00:02:12.950> time<00:02:13.190> we

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
or we call rake but at the same time we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.490 
or we call rake but at the same time we
put<00:02:13.880> these<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:15.050> see<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.230> light

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
put these on and you can see that light

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.080 
put these on and you can see that light

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
stays focused what we've done here is

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.960 
stays focused what we've done here is
develop<00:02:17.660> technology<00:02:18.260> called<00:02:18.470> XYZ<00:02:19.250> optics<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
develop technology called XYZ optics and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.640 
develop technology called XYZ optics and
what<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.270> is<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.660> lens<00:02:20.870> geometry<00:02:21.440> what

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
what that is is a lens geometry what

what that is is a lens geometry what
we've<00:02:21.800> done<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.100> actually<00:02:22.280> concentrated<00:02:23.210> lens

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
we've done is actually concentrated lens

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.030 
we've done is actually concentrated lens
material<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.170> optical<00:02:24.560> center<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:24.920> it's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
material the optical center so it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.280 
material the optical center so it's
actually<00:02:25.130> thicker<00:02:25.550> right<00:02:25.820> here<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.959> thicker

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
actually thicker right here that thicker

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.650 
actually thicker right here that thicker
material<00:02:27.830> actually<00:02:28.040> draws<00:02:28.490> more<00:02:28.760> light<00:02:29.000> just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
material actually draws more light just

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.120 
material actually draws more light just
like<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.990> science<00:02:30.170> class<00:02:30.440> your<00:02:30.800> little

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
like in science class your little

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.740 
like in science class your little
younger<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.490> might<00:02:31.610> have<00:02:31.730> learned<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
younger you might have learned that you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.150 
younger you might have learned that you
have<00:02:32.870> two<00:02:33.050> cylinders<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.500> glass<00:02:33.740> sitting<00:02:34.130> on

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
have two cylinders a glass sitting on

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.310 
have two cylinders a glass sitting on
the<00:02:34.220> windowsill<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.240> solar<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.690> glass<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.170> has

the windowsill the solar of glass it has

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.140 
the windowsill the solar of glass it has
more<00:02:36.530> water<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.130> it's<00:02:37.490> going<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.640> draw<00:02:37.940> more

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
more water in it it's going to draw more

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.940 
more water in it it's going to draw more
light<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.900> if<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.080> put<00:02:39.260> more<00:02:39.440> material<00:02:39.890> an

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
light so if you put more material an

light so if you put more material an
optical<00:02:40.280> center<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.670> lens<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.420> going

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
optical center of this lens it's going

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.479 
optical center of this lens it's going
to<00:02:41.630> draw<00:02:41.870> more<00:02:42.110> light<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.920> at<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.070> same<00:02:43.280> time

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
to draw more light but at the same time

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.949 
to draw more light but at the same time
you<00:02:43.730> don't<00:02:43.820> want<00:02:43.970> light<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.420> come<00:02:44.510> over<00:02:44.750> here

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
you don't want light to come over here

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.020 
you don't want light to come over here
to<00:02:44.989> be<00:02:45.290> over<00:02:45.709> corrected<00:02:46.010> or<00:02:46.340> redirected<00:02:46.850> too

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
to be over corrected or redirected too

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.970 
to be over corrected or redirected too
much<00:02:47.239> what<00:02:47.510> we've<00:02:47.630> done<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.930> tapered<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.470> so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
much what we've done is tapered it so

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.710 
much what we've done is tapered it so
coming<00:02:49.280> from<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.520> optical<00:02:49.850> center<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.540> gets

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
coming from the optical center it gets

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.820 
coming from the optical center it gets
thinner<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.170> thinner<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.470> thinner<00:02:51.530> and

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
thinner and thinner and thinner and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.320
