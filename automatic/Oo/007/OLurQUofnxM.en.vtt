the design I'd like to show you is
called<00:00:26.760> rush<00:00:27.150> hour

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
called rush hour

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.710

rush hour is a wonderful design that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.390 
rush hour is a wonderful design that
looks<00:00:30.960> woven<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.310> let's<00:00:32.520> get<00:00:32.700> started<00:00:34.400> any

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
looks woven so let's get started any

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.360 
looks woven so let's get started any
grid<00:00:35.790> pattern<00:00:36.300> requires<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:37.050> grid<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.830> here's<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
grid pattern requires a grid so here's a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.580 
grid pattern requires a grid so here's a
grid<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.730> I've<00:00:39.060> marked<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.350> piece<00:00:40.560> of

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
grid that I've marked on my piece of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.360 
grid that I've marked on my piece of
paper<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.340> course<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.870> were<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.980> sewing

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
paper of course if you were to be sewing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.640 
paper of course if you were to be sewing
this<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.180> grid<00:00:45.480> would<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.870> marked<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.320> chalk

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
this this grid would be marked in chalk

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.420 
this this grid would be marked in chalk
I'm<00:00:46.980> using<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.180> one-inch<00:00:48.660> scale<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.950> this

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I'm using a one-inch scale but this

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
I'm using a one-inch scale but this
pattern<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.150> modified<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.200> any<00:00:52.590> scale

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
pattern can be modified to any scale

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.850 
pattern can be modified to any scale
actually<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:54.570> fit<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.019> needs<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.559> quilt

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
actually to fit the needs of your quilt

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
actually to fit the needs of your quilt
that<00:00:56.040> you're<00:00:56.250> doing<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:57.330> I<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.989> one

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that you're doing so I need to do one

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.500 
that you're doing so I need to do one
more<00:00:58.379> adjustment<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.339> this<00:00:59.489> grid<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> couple

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
more adjustment to this grid a couple

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.960 
more adjustment to this grid a couple
more<00:01:00.690> marks<00:01:01.019> before<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.160> start<00:01:02.460> rush-hour

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
more marks before I can start rush-hour

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.640 
more marks before I can start rush-hour
and<00:01:03.330> that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.379> add<00:01:04.559> parallel<00:01:05.339> lines<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
and that is to add parallel lines in

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.510 
and that is to add parallel lines in
kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.920> weave<00:01:08.310> pattern<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.520> these

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
kind of a weave pattern like so these

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 
kind of a weave pattern like so these
lines<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.330> roughly<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.050> quarter<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> size<00:01:13.980> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
lines are roughly a quarter the size of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
lines are roughly a quarter the size of
each<00:01:15.180> grid<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> pretty<00:01:20.400> simple<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
each grid so pretty simple you do that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
each grid so pretty simple you do that
for<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> whole<00:01:26.370> grid<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.510> enough<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
for the whole grid but this is enough to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.390 
for the whole grid but this is enough to
show<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.560> pattern<00:01:29.390> I'm<00:01:30.740> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> start

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
show you the pattern I'm going to start

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.110 
show you the pattern I'm going to start
on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.540> outside<00:01:33.840> edge<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.460> first<00:01:35.820> mark

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
on the outside edge of my first mark

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.020 
on the outside edge of my first mark
here<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.260> top<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> grid<00:01:37.980> come<00:01:38.880> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
here up at the top of the grid come on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.750 
here up at the top of the grid come on
down<00:01:39.330> when<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> meet<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.380> reach<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.220> middle

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
down when I meet you reach about middle

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:50.460 
down when I meet you reach about middle
of<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.030> grid<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.870> draw<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.110> circle

the second line now at this point I want

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.729 
the second line now at this point I want

on my pattern is running this way across
the<00:03:25.609> page<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:26.389> want<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.900> start<00:03:27.230> my<00:03:27.560> pattern

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150
