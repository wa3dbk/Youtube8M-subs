00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.700
 Good afternoon. The bad weather has led to .... 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.200
 that a lot fewer people came to De Boat Giet Oan than expected. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.900
 The expected traffic chaos therefore did not materialize. 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 Some two hundred historic ships sail today ... 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.900
 from Sneek via Scharnegoutum and Weidum to Leeuwarden. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.100
 Around 100,000 people were expected for the entire weekend. 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.200
 But in Leeuwarden only the true 'diehards' were watching in the afternoon. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 So many old boats, that is very nice. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.700
 So even though it rains even harder, I remain standing. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.400
 The ships are still there tomorrow. There are also activities such as a mini opera. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.300
 On Monday the fleet will continue to Dokkum and the German city of Leer. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.800
 A downer for cyclist Lieuwe Westra who in the individual time trial of the Tour ... 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.300
 currently fourteenth. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.900
 He expected more from this day, because time trial is his specialty. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
 But the weather was bad. 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.700
 The feeling was so good that I myself ... 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 If it is just the same for everyone then I lose something in the corners ... 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.300
 but in the end the strong ones still come up again. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.100
 Because there were also many straight pieces, but yes ... 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.000
 I crossed the line in a light mood ... 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 but now I see the last hundred men on TV driving in the sun. 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 Yes then ... I almost stand with tears in my eyes. Really incredible. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 A Langezwaagster died after an accident in St. Nicolaasga. He was hit ... 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 when he crossed the road. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.700
 It happened last night at Spannenburgerdyk. The 29-year-old man walked there ... 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.300
 and suddenly crossed. An 82-year-old motorist from Woudsend scooped the man. 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.100
 He was seriously injured with the trauma heli brought to the UMCG in Groningen. 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 He died there last night. The police are investigating the correct circumstances. 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 The road in question is forbidden for walkers. 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.700
 The Westindian neighborhood in Leeuwarden is against plans by housing cooperative Elkien. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.300
 He wants to demolish 134 homes in the neighborhood. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 Eachien finds the post-war homes in the NijlÃ¢n district no longer of this time. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.400
 They want to replace them with new ones. 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 Some residents fear higher housing costs and have therefore started an action group. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 They have speculated on the cost of energy, which would be higher. 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 If you insulate better, then ... But that's speculation. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.600
 You cannot predict how high those costs will be. 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.400
 Elkien continues the demolition and new construction plans ... 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.200
 if 70% of the residents agree. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.000
 A special image has been revealed in Workum. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 It is an image of singer Frans Bauer, but in a special version. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.300
 It is an image made of Lego stones, 20,000 to be exact. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.100
 An initiative of music channel TV Oranje and the Lego World event. 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.300
 Bauer performed at Workum at a summer festival. 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.100
 What you call summer. So the weather: 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.300
 Tonight around 13 degrees. The wind is weakening, but it keeps raining. 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.000
 Tomorrow is an autumn day, around 16 degrees and just like today a lot of rain. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.600
 There is less wind. 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.400
 This was Hjud with the short news. Staks at six o'clock more and other news. 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 See you then. 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
