00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
do they have a full controller that is a

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.129 
do they have a full controller that is a
little<00:04:14.370> bit<00:04:14.489> like<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.180> modern<00:04:15.629> controllers

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
little bit like the modern controllers

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.810 
little bit like the modern controllers
nowaday<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.769> will<00:04:16.889> be<00:04:17.039> pretty<00:04:17.250> easy<00:04:17.370> to

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
that that you can access their I think

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.720 
that that you can access their I think
it<00:04:46.210> offers<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.750> best<00:04:47.140> selection<00:04:47.610> when<00:04:48.610> it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
it offers the best selection when it

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.910 
it offers the best selection when it
comes<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.450> your<00:04:49.750> content<00:04:50.260> and<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.470> think<00:04:50.710> that's

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
comes to your content and I think that's

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.040 
comes to your content and I think that's
where<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.220> key<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.610> in<00:04:52.540> these<00:04:52.720> little<00:04:52.900> devices

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
where the key is in these little devices

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.430 
where the key is in these little devices
is<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.790> content<00:04:54.790> that<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.240> can<00:04:55.510> consume<00:04:56.170> I

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
is the content that you can consume I

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.900 
is the content that you can consume I
believe<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.910> best<00:04:57.940> on<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:59.560> fire<00:05:00.010> TV<00:05:00.340> side
