00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.540 

far<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:45.840> style<00:00:46.110> play<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.489> up

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
far is our style play we like to get up

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
far is our style play we like to get up
and<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.899> get<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and down the more you can get up and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
and down the more you can get up and
down<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> court<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.800> catch<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> defense<00:00:50.520> maybe

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
down the court and catch a defense maybe

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.130 
down the court and catch a defense maybe
a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.120> off<00:00:51.270> balance<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.899> gives<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a little bit off balance that gives you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
a little bit off balance that gives you
a<00:00:52.170> greater<00:00:52.410> opportunity<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.430> high

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
a greater opportunity for a high

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
a greater opportunity for a high
percentage<00:00:54.180> shot<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> up

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
percentage shot so we like to get it up

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.080 
percentage shot so we like to get it up
and<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.340> fun<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> play<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.940> way

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
anywhere but it's that team chemistry

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.399 
anywhere but it's that team chemistry
and<00:01:27.799> coming<00:01:28.100> together<00:01:28.189> is<00:01:28.689> huge<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:29.929> we've

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
got some high expectations and I think

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.020 
got some high expectations and I think
what<00:01:32.539> you're<00:01:32.659> talking<00:01:32.990> about<00:01:33.140> chemistry<00:01:34.030> that

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
what you're talking about chemistry that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.309 
what you're talking about chemistry that
certainly<00:01:35.359> has<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:35.630> be<00:01:35.750> one<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:35.899> our<00:01:36.079> greatest

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
certainly has to be one of our greatest

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.859 
certainly has to be one of our greatest
strengths<00:01:36.799> you<00:01:37.009> watch<00:01:37.189> us<00:01:37.399> play<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.030> we're

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
strengths you watch us play and we're

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:39.940 
strengths you watch us play and we're
gonna<00:01:38.990> move<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.289> ball<00:01:39.469> until<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:39.799> get<00:01:39.859> the

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
on a different team that we might have

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.510 
on a different team that we might have
taken<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.349> shot<00:01:45.709> or<00:01:45.920> we<00:01:46.009> might<00:01:46.159> have<00:01:46.340> been<00:01:46.489> a

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
taken that shot or we might have been a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.160 
taken that shot or we might have been a
little<00:01:46.819> bit<00:01:46.909> more<00:01:46.939> selfish<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.840> can

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
little bit more selfish but now we can

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.109 
little bit more selfish but now we can
always<00:01:48.469> make<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.829> right<00:01:48.860> play<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.700> it'll
