00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.939
 voice of Catania the president 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.959
 shoppers that the next day is more 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.910
 peaceful but still bitter 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.100
 we witnessed an episode that did not 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.720
 had never occurred 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.460
 so change of football but at least a 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.800
 series level I believe also standard 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.590
 b is clearly an episode that does not occur 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.140
 it has to check more because vice versa 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.730
 we would have introduced for another rule 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.970
 of our our sport that what 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.810
 the benches can now protest or 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:46.250
 let's review the game by poster 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.710
 technical error or with the test 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.470
 Television disqualify players 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.270
 of the juve who have behaved in 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.940
 this way there is a regulation that speaks 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.250
 clear the player who is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.560
 get off the bench is warned and then 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.510
 expelled the president of catania who 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.829
 yesterday and 5 after what happened it is 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.479
 allowed to applaud a decision 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.759
 of the referee was seen from fourth 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.289
 man at a distance of 40 meters and is 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.060
 was rightly expelled 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.609
 as marotta says juve would have won 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.929
 the same I do not have these certainties 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.200
 he does, and this also makes me a bit scared 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.729
 However 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 we would have lost anyway because marotta 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990
 says that anyway by drinking the juve a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.520
 probably reversed something 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 would have changed in those forty 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.729
 seconds or no would have been applied 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.610
 regulation as it happened in 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 past and how right it is 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.770
 therefore the goal would have been given on 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 player protesting that way 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.310
 he would have been warned or sent off his profile 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 facebook the aia denies I have not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.689
 reason not to believe 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.640
 the profile is certainly false but 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.189
 since there is such a federal proxy 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.780
 how to investigate the president 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.640
 you can also do membership cards 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 on the referees to see if this profile is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 really false things that I repeat I believe 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.549
 because you said lai has therefore not a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.769
 reason is easy it does not take an investigation 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.079
 of February and some other of the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.900
 china is very simple to see if a 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.849
 profile and and false by chance punish the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.739
 guilty because it is also in the interest 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.280
 check this out for me and Gianni 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.670
 speech then here of what the spoke 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.430
 pulvirenti president and a profile 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.310
 facebook of maggiani that would be 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.739
 appeared in this profile he had one 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.680
 photo of the Juventus emblem 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.310
 we have verified here is reported 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.269
 also on gazzetta.it and it is 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.709
 evidently of a false profile 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.720
 plus if it were true it would be 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.269
 was really a crazy naivety 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.940
 by di di Maggiani and in any case 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.250
 I repeat we have checked and it is about 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.620
 an ad hoc built profile 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.620
 now about the referees next
