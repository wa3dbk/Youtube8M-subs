00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
there basically so the the the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
there basically so the the the
dimensions<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.190> utensil<00:00:35.190> holder<00:00:35.610> are

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
dimensions of this utensil holder are
going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.120> I'm<00:00:36.649> assuming<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.770> you're

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
using like regular size pencils and pens

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
using like regular size pencils and pens
if<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.500> using<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> those<00:00:41.309> large

if you're using like one of those large

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
if you're using like one of those large
pencils<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.270> sure<00:00:42.420> that's<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> fit

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
pencils I'm sure that's not going to fit

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.600 
pencils I'm sure that's not going to fit
in<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> tell<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.489> the

in here so I'm going to tell you the
dimensions<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
dimensions of this so if you this is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
dimensions of this so if you this is
what<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> looks<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> stick

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
assuming that you know how to make a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.179 
assuming that you know how to make a
regular<00:01:08.189> bifold<00:01:08.700> wallet<00:01:08.909> um<00:01:09.409> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.159> don't

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
regular bifold wallet um if you don't

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
regular bifold wallet um if you don't
know<00:01:11.430> how<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> make<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> bifold<00:01:12.180> wallet<00:01:12.360> then

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
know how to make a bifold wallet then

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
know how to make a bifold wallet then
I'll<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> video<00:01:14.729> I'll<00:01:14.820> put<00:01:15.000> the

I'll put one of the video I'll put the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
I'll put one of the video I'll put the
my<00:01:15.420> video<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> description<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.380> how<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
my video in the description on how to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
my video in the description on how to
make<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.580> look<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.000> youtube

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
make it or you can just look on youtube

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
make it or you can just look on youtube
how<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.049> basic<00:01:19.409> bifold<00:01:19.860> wallet<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
how to make a basic bifold wallet but

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.240 
how to make a basic bifold wallet but
don't<00:01:20.850> fold<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> flat<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.770> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
don't fold it make it flat like this so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.620 
don't fold it make it flat like this so
the<00:01:23.580> dimensions<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> are<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the dimensions of this are going to be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.859 
the dimensions of this are going to be
um<00:01:25.040> nine<00:01:26.040> inches<00:01:26.280> exactly<00:01:26.509> for<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> length

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
um nine inches exactly for the length

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
um nine inches exactly for the length
and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.259> height<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> little

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and the height is going to be a little

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
and the height is going to be a little
over<00:01:30.119> three<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.570> half<00:01:30.600> inches<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.229> that's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
over three and a half inches and that's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
over three and a half inches and that's
the<00:01:32.009> exact<00:01:32.250> dimensions<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.810> once

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the exact dimensions for this so once

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.270 
the exact dimensions for this so once
you've<00:01:34.110> made<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.439> all<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you've made this all you have to do you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.580
