00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.279
 how to enter further into the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 mystery of the person of the Holy Spirit 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.950
 we can first point out that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.830
 philosophy we define god as pure 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.310
 mind he is not material he is pure 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.949
 mind 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.220
 so we can see that the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.190
 holy spirit has as proper name a 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.129
 essential attribute of god that's true 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 that actually the word spirits in this case 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 it is rather in the sense that in theology we 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 says that the third person from the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 trinity breathe by father and son 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.549
 he proceeds from father and son by 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.790
 elsewhere theology as a result of 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.699
 saint-jean defined god as love he 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.840
 is not pure intelligence only he 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.890
 is love communion in person and that's 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.540
 also a great bias to enter a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.770
 little more in the person of the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.020
 holy spirit simply observe what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.780
 happens when a young boy a young 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.670
 girl falls in love how to describe 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.009
 this experience that exceed them 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.329
 completely in which they are by 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.759
 which they are submerged 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.000
 we can say that it is like a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.399
 dive on a hot day one day 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.710
 summer in a mountain stream 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.570
 they suddenly felt it had embellished 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.909
 regenerate invigorated they feel 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.590
 push wings they feel inscribed 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.039
 in a confidence such as they have 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.380
 never experienced and then after 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.770
 after this experience well they have 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.799
 two solutions first let yourself 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 drift according to the current a little bit like 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.090
 a board 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.899
 only the torrent will become river 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.810
 the river will become tributary maybe 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.000
 then river before ending up at the ocean and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.160
 we know alas they are going 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.830
 meet a growing water 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.260
 polluted since our streams our 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.110
 rivers take care of a lot a lot 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.250
 of pollution and they risk being 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.860
 step by step 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.740
 arranged by this water which yet 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 had invigorated and before she 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.680
 poison it may feel like 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.560
 to get out 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.150
 but thank god there is a second 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.580
 solution is to go back up the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.550
 to go in the opposite direction from swimming to 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.570
 countercurrent to always back up 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.480
 to the source 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.900
 and there it is for sure they will meet a 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.330
 more and more pure water at our baptism 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.610
 we are immersed in this 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.650
 burst of life and love what 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.320
 the holy spirit we are baptized in 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.940
 the spirit is confirmed a few years 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.720
 later by the sacrament of 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.290
 confirmation 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.090
 we can say that at each communion 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.209
 every conflict confession it's a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.320
 reactivation of this joy of this 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.850
 plunge of this immersion there is a 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.410
 second way to understand a little 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.380
 to approach what the Holy Spirit and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.070
 what he does is to study closely 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.370
 all the fruits of which saint paul makes 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.560
 the enumeration in the letter to the Galatians 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.980
 joy confidence self-control 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.260
 benevolence and so on humility I 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.190
 will not say it all I mention 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.560
 simply the joy the joy given by the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.200
 holy spirit that is not necessarily 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.470
 loud laughs a joy a little 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.209
 superficial it's a lot more joy 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.860
 deep 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.190
 the opposite of the joy of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.530
 holy spirit it's not sadness 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.940
 it is the hardness of heart 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.769
 the holy spirit as the saint said 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.350
 curé d'ars liquefies us and suddenly the 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.680
 Christian obviously still goes through 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.299
 storms sometimes big storms 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.579
 but it's like the oceans 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.180
 because he has the joy of the Holy Spirit 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.640
 a few meters below the level of 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.190
 the ocean there is serenity there can 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.910
 have calm look in the 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.700
 Gospels 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.890
 at the moment of his passion Jesus is talking about 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.590
 his joy is quite amazing and 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.280
 a robin marthe who we know she 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.450
 was suffering passion 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.250
 that she lived very things 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.960
 difficult and is a person 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.460
 extremely happy and guay take a 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.550
 another fruit of the holy spirit the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.300
 consolation he is the comforter that 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.130
 which comforts us in which way well 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.900
 this is not the consolation of a 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.220
 hot water bottle that we put the night in winter 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.250
 when it's too cold 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.430
 it is a consolation much more 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.310
 toning 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.650
 it is a consolation in the sense that it 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.070
 is inscribed in the tapestry of 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.400
 bayeux 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.640
 we see this little fun scene 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.440
 lévesque 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.419
 oddo inches with his spear or his sword I 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.419
 do not know anymore a soldier for 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.540
 force him to join the fray is at 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.520
 on it there is written oddo comforts his 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.590
 soldiers 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.810
 funny way to comfort but that's it 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.630
 the Holy Spirit drives us to boldness 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.910
 he drives us out of ourselves 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.240
 at the end of spring we all 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.430
 had his joys suddenly we see 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.320
 to get near the window of the small 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.690
 chick a little lost who come to do 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.120
 on the ground before leaving and we 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.940
 guess it's their parents who 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.870
 forced to leave the nest for 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.380
 take flight 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.860
 and yes the holy spirit forces us to 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.580
 we eject from us cozy nest for 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.950
 really take off again 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.919
 way of saying the holy spirit in our 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.800
 lives it's this little story it 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:15.460
 was once a little butterfly 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.669
 fell in love with a happy star 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.050
 excited he confided he confiding in his 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.789
 big brother a little butterfly on May 6 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.740
 already rebellious teenager is already a little 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.539
 marginal who were laughing at him in 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.390
 saying oh what are you losing your 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.640
 time to that we must aim a shade there 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.650
 you have feelings here you'll be you 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.660
 burn the wings 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.650
 but the little butterfly keeps to his good 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.190
 meaning and do not know convinced he 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.599
 continuous and every night currencies and 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.330
 the inaccessible star the others 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:52.000
 were going to burn lampshades 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.939
 and he and it's after those night after 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.310
 night trying to reach 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.810
 the inaccessible star 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.020
 obviously every morning at dawn they 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.500
 were exhausted but while the 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.099
 others were burned for a long time 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.400
 his brothers and sisters himself 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:14.680
 resplendent with an inner beauty 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.530
 extraordinary then since in our 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.569
 lives we are offered the light of a 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.030
 star 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:25.169
 do not waste our time burning ourselves 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.169
 a few streetlights
