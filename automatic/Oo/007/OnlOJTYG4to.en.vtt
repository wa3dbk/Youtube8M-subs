00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.470 
Kevin Dulli described broke the law do
you<00:02:01.080> think<00:02:01.260> he's<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.560> being<00:02:01.830> smart<00:02:02.420> yeah<00:02:03.420> I

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
you think he's just being smart yeah I

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.300 
you think he's just being smart yeah I
think<00:02:03.630> he's<00:02:03.990> being<00:02:04.230> smart<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.650> well<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
think he's being smart as well but I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.460 
think he's being smart as well but I
also<00:02:05.550> think<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.420> possibly<00:02:06.870> one<00:02:07.440> of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
also think that this is possibly one of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.320 
also think that this is possibly one of
the<00:02:07.560> greatest<00:02:07.950> blacks<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.760> could<00:02:08.910> ever<00:02:09.060> pull

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the greatest blacks you could ever pull

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.350 
the greatest blacks you could ever pull
off<00:02:09.479> if<00:02:09.900> you<00:02:10.430> for<00:02:11.430> example<00:02:11.490> go<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.240> have

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
off if you for example go out and have

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.000 
off if you for example go out and have
sex<00:02:12.540> with<00:02:12.690> six<00:02:13.050> different<00:02:13.290> women<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.860> have

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
sex with six different women and have

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.350 
sex with six different women and have
relationships<00:02:14.490> with<00:02:14.730> six<00:02:15.000> different<00:02:15.090> women

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
relationships with six different women

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.390 
relationships with six different women
all<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.020> need<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> doctor's<00:02:16.860> note<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.220> say

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
all you need is a doctor's note to say

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.310 
all you need is a doctor's note to say
you've<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:18.120> multiple<00:02:18.330> personality<00:02:19.290> syndrome

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
you've got multiple personality syndrome

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.460 
you've got multiple personality syndrome
and<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.820> carry<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.210> quite<00:02:21.840> happily<00:02:22.260> with

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and you can carry on quite happily with

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.650 
and you can carry on quite happily with
these<00:02:22.620> relationships<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.270> we<00:02:24.510> should

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
these relationships so I think we should

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.030 
these relationships so I think we should
perhaps<00:02:24.780> look<00:02:24.930> into<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.380> personality

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
perhaps look into this personality

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.250 
perhaps look into this personality
disorders<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.880> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.360> kind<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> ripoff

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
disorders are kind of a kind of a ripoff

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.170 
disorders are kind of a kind of a ripoff
they're<00:02:28.740> not<00:02:28.860> real<00:02:29.100> are<00:02:29.490> they<00:02:29.700> I'm<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
they're not real are they I'm the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.660 
they're not real are they I'm the
comment<00:02:30.630> well<00:02:30.870> look<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:32.010> think<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.490> all<00:02:32.640> just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
comment well look I think it's all just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.990 
comment well look I think it's all just
a<00:02:33.000> phony<00:02:33.750> way<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> get<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.470> jail<00:02:34.700> man<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
this type of multiple personalities and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.070 
this type of multiple personalities and
I<00:02:39.000> feel<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.300> they'd<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> much<00:02:39.900> better
