00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello guys with you andrew and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.930
 today i will show you how to make tea 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.230
 lemon-flavored lipton at home 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.719
 terms and conditions 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.150
 of course tea will be like there everything will be 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.720
 observed in sugar and all that but not 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.430
 there will be 7 preservatives because the composition of sugar 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 water acidity regulators 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 acid acetate on citations sodium 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 tri-substituted black tea extract 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.460
 lemon juice from gyze concentrator and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 oxidant sweetener is shorter very 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 such a composition is actually very good 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.789
 but what we need we need with 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 you lemon two medium lemons on 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 a bottle of 175 or 2 liters 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.629
 then we need a proper 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.969
 some kind of saucepan about the same 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.850
 black and sugar actually still i 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.359
 took the scales to be dragged from the Crimea 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.680
 what do we need so get down to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.659
 cooking 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 and so actually proceed to 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 cooking take a lemon and clean 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.009
 one of them 2 do not need to be cleaned so 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 first we need both peeled lemon 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.270
 cut his own cut the smaller 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.720
 all the better 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.090
 but I advise you to cut with a sharp knife or 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.970
 spicy and so that the juice does not flow much 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.310
 just the news of which will flow to longing 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 we lose with you cut into 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.240
 our lemon ring 2 take a lemon and straight 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 so peel clean it here already 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.299
 it is possible and the amount is less than just 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.189
 us in the skin 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:56.219
 lemon should be good juicy and 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:59.159
 soft parts soft actually we all 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.500
 sliced ​​lemon with lemon until all and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.049
 so let's proceed further as to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.869
 tea black tea ordinary without any 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.729
 impurities I actually took this to us 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.759
 it will take 10 grams 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.180
 if you do not have exact 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.470
 he their forests then it is 2 tablespoons 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:24.829
 and so proceed to the soho I now zeroed 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.500
 readings we need 2 liters 140 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.329
 gram of sugar 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:37.810
 because the sugar content in the mite is not 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:39.590
 69 per 100 grams ie 140 grams per 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.829
 our 2 liters 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.650
 for those again who have no scales this is 7 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:50.060
 tablespoons with a slide of large tablespoons 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.480
 spoons that is here I now take a spoon 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.760
 sugar and on the scales here it becomes 119 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:03.889
 there were 140 here guys on this sugar all 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:07.970
 you can put it aside and so 1 and 9 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:09.709
 liters of water well, 18 I got in the pot 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.319
 nag you beforehand here i am 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.209
 boiled his saffina so it was 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.510
 I bottled still boiled and 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.669
 actually flooded 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.840
 especially poured into the pot and set on 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:32.780
 wednesday medium fire and immediately add 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:37.669
 I chai tea, I said we need all this 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.669
 will interfere we will interfere with a spoon 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.669
 tablespoon knead so 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 Here we wait a couple of minutes so it went smoothly 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:12.220
 two minutes I slowed down a little fire with 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.840
 sixes diluted it to the four and 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.510
 now we add our lemon to one 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.060
 hand it will be quite difficult to do so 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:29.130
 what we put to the crater 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.130
 and actually add our lemon and 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.880
 cleaned and not cleaned if there is on 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.000
 sock some juice lemon tom that too 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.870
 and you have two droplets so it makes sense 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:53.229
 hide no special so we all added 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:55.300
 lemon now we stir and add sugar 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.200
 sugar can of course add less 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.830
 because i took 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.039
 the norms of lipton itself are so much on 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.930
 final on package if you like 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.590
 less sugar less sweet add 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.110
 less if you want to drink sweet tea but 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.090
 do not want to get this calorie can 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.180
 buy a sugar substitute and read in 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.800
 Internet substitution sweetener 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.160
 add literally I think a gram in 40 and 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.020
 you will be part sweet and practically 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:31.979
 not high-calorie we all need to give lemon 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:37.300
 penny and sugar to the maximum 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:39.010
 growing wait for another 5-7 minutes so 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.020
 four minutes have passed I completely 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:46.599
 turned off the fire still stirred sugar already 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.599
 ready completely dissolved about lemon 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.470
 I have some questions because 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:55.900
 although lemon if you want more 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:06:00.390
 saturated to taste lemon you 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:03.050
 can it become a little bit 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:07.069
 or simply by 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:10.460
 such a thing kabakam take kabakam 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:12.199
 we press a piece and squeeze the juice on 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.050
 this is far from necessarily the principle for 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:19.970
 good taste will be like this 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.909
 here are enough guys now worth lipton 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:28.039
 strain that is all 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:31.569
 all but the main tea is already brewed 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:34.069
 we need to strain into a separate vessel 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.110
 own all filtered here especially 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:39.409
 no comments needed just through 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.000
 sieve strain on you it turned out 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:45.560
 a bit so if you can say honey 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.580
 turned out a little lighter in color than 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.479
 original egypt 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.360
 because we used lemon juice 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:55.370
 they are citric acid other crap 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.409
 which is mixed there in general with us 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:02.449
 turned out natural but the same 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:05.270
 delicious refreshing as lipton tea now 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.669
 actually need it either way either 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:11.630
 pour in a bottle and cool drink this 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:14.599
 tea I personally recommend chilled what 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.509
 it's tasty and refreshing 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.400
 here and so you made lipton your 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:22.610
 hands at home 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.250
 it turned out incredibly tasty I already had it 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.550
 tried moderately sweet moderately 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.039
 Lemon and guys I advise everyone to 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.409
