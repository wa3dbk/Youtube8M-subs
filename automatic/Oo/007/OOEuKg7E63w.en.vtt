 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.629
 new video I have so last week 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099
 already announced this is a giveaway 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.380

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.049
 beautiful thing here the nvidia 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210

 after the intro key fun 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.349
 that's like the atg 07 has them on 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.269
 in any case its weak points above all 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.969
 at the display but by and large 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 it's a pretty cool tablet 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.840
 overall and, above all, one of the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.660
 best tablets you can buy if 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 you want to play android games and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.020
 That's why I'm actually relatively happy 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.730
 that I can give one to you so 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.090

 description, it is still there 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.410
 and yes if you want more information on the device 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.539
 want to have a look below 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.400
 over so the thing is quite nice 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.650
 you just have to go under this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
 video here so this feeling video 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.880
 not the review not any other 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.159
 video but this video here 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.380
 Write a comment was purely written 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.119
 why do you like that in the attika motives 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 just want to win 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.180
 The winner will then be in two weeks 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 randomly drawn and the matter is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.200
 when the random calls comment 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.850
 rauskommt where in wiesbaden or where 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.490
 it just shit then i will 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.049
 again by chance a tripping it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.759
 Definitely a good comment 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.829
 However, I want to win anyway 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.659
 definitely do it by chance because of it 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.340
 often very difficult to decide 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.740
 until now that has earned the most 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 but nevertheless writes something good rows 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.409
 because if you only shit in rhein 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.360
 the comment 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.119
 then I will if you place out 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.500
 comes again the random number generator 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.700
 let someone go for it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.530
 definitely a good one 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.180
 Comments posted known 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.829
 the winner will be given at the same time 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.079
