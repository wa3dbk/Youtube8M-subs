00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Nine Habits of Effective Clicker Trainers

00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:04.081
Part 1 Using rewards

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:05.462
* indicates click of clicker for deaf and HOH

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:06.383
"sit" indicates spoken cues

00:00:06.384 --> 00:00:08.524
Some people believe that dogs should want to work

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.515
for people without external rewards

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.546
Dogs that do this are rare.

00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.517
The rest of us must work to create such a bond with our dogs.

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:20.078
Treats, toys, life rewards and your attention and praise

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:24.009
Improve your skills by practicing the following techniques.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.010
are all tools to build this bond.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.010
A. Use High Value Rewards when training new behaviors

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.411
or in new places.

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.782
Treats should be small (the size of a pea) for most dogs

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:34.493
smaller for little dogs.

00:00:34.504 --> 00:00:36.014
and soft so they don't crumble and distract from training.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:42.015
hard cheese, beef bits, cooked kidney beans, leftovers

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:45.016
cooked turkey sausage, liver, kibble

00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:48.887
Subtract the treat volume from her total daily food intake.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.218
Toys make great rewards too.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.889
They are usually used after your dog understands the basic behavior.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.620
Can you guess which is Jessie's favorite?

00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:03.221
"Get it"

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:09.222
B. Rate of Reward Must be High

00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:11.013
especially during new learning and shaping a new behavior

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:27.454
Rapid Fire Rewards are a series of clicks and treats in fast succession.

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.015
It keeps your dog's focus during high distraction and interupts unwanted behaviors!

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:34.016
Rapid fire is also a great way to teach your service dog to focus on you

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:35.527
when anyone approaches or pets her.

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:40.018
How many clicks and treats do you count in this 10 second period?

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:46.019
C. Be Generous with Rewards,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
especially for key steps and trouble spots!

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:51.021
Jackpot Rewards

00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:53.812
are one click followed by five to ten treats delivered one by one.

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:58.813
She flips the switch with her nose!         "Good girl!"

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:03.814
And is handsomely rewarded!

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:06.815
D. Reward Delivery can be critical to your success!

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:12.816
You can reward in position, while in motion and to reposition her.

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:16.817
Rewarding for position while staying down on the bed.

00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:19.818
You can hand it to her...

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.819
or throw it if you bave good aim.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.550
Reward while in motion.

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:30.821
Make sure your dog keeps moving as she eats so it reinforces the motion.

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:34.992
Jessie is rewarded for heeling close to my leg.

00:02:39.823 --> 00:02:41.003
...in slow motion

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:46.824
Throw the treats to reset the behavior

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:48.826
so your dog can do it again 

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:49.827
or to add distance.

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:50.446
"Jessie, shut!"

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:55.377
Watch how she follows the treat,

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:58.838
then turns back toward the door to shut it again.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.829
E. Get the Rewards Off You as Soon As You Can

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.830
Your dog will learn to trust that despite no smell on you,

00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:09.831
her reward will appear!

00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:11.112
Place them on a counter,

00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:12.833
in a cupboard,

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:16.834
and eventually in another room.

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:18.515
F. Use Life Rewards

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:21.006
These are things the dog enjoys or wants to do:

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:22.527
going for a car ride, playing with a dog, greeting a person,

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:24.008
getting a bum scratch, being allowed to sniff,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.009
roughhousing with her person,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.010
snuggling with her person,

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:28.011
going out a door

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:38.012
or having a squeaky toy thrown after an awesome recall!

00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:47.013
G. Make a list of all the rewards that you can think of that your dog wants.

00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:48.544
Include treats, toys and life rewards.

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.015
Prioritize them from high to low.

00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:52.676
H. When moving to a new location, or adding distractions, distance or duration,

00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:54.047
start with high value rewards.

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:57.018
Use the list you created to decrease their value as she progresses.

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.019
I. Variety is the Spice of Life!

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.000
Keep your dog guessing as to what reward she will get

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.161
for doing any learned behavior.

00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:07.002
Maybe she'll get a treat, ball toss, massage or a car ride. This keeps her interest.

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:08.533
Jessie brings me a coin.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:11.444
A tug toy increases her enthusiasm

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:16.025
Even my laugh is a reward!

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:23.876
"Good girl!"

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:28.027
A gentle neck massage calms her down.

00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:34.028
With practice, success and fun, a strong bond is created

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:38.029
and your praise and attention increase in value to her.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.550
Many of the tasks and behaviors may also become rewards in themselves!

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:47.033
Vancouver Island Assistance Dogs

00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:48.034
Helping owners train their own service dogs

00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:49.035
in the Nanaimo, BC area.
