00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.610
 on 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.569
 Red I respect 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.009
 No where those noses worked that change is and that's been long 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.009
 not every day that was 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.929
 Hamster wheel operation one is nonsense scoreless disconnect field tackert macht macht 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.089
 and this time outside it is still possible at all now 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.090
 We only make or work losses 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.100
 if McLaren from Dr 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.050
 but to pass us the time 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.570
 in the direction of Marburg the idea follows when he says that I still have it on 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.760
 did not approve 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.510
 So many corrections every day for more I just do service 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.330
 according to regulations 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.740
 That's exactly the signal to the students only service by regulation but 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.980
 Actually, all Kirst have a need to shape and learn otherwise 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.010
 we would not be 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.560
 as far as we are part of the buzzer human basic property the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.620
 Students are within 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.920
 six weeks in a position to turn 180 degrees 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.170
 I think that's not the problem at all when the school meets me 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.299
 that said about neater conversation Bedi yes I've registered my child there 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.590
 Look, maybe this is Wars 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.410
 the war then that's what 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.820
 traditionally under the shoes term 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.530
 a teacher at the front of the board and 30 students are the ingredients aligned 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 what you imagine and school traditional 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.560
 this does not take place this question of what we do there 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.880
 unrestricted first with 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.789
 Absolutely meaningful to be able to answer that totally relaxed when I feel 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.670
 introduce with which 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.710
 have not polished up before 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.760
 is the hair 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.730
 every day a sunny day 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.840
 many things have long since arrived in the universities and are being emptied 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450
 and the people who know that 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.130
 who is not hired 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 and there you can still buy as much as you can and put computers into the schools 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 he would have had kids evenings staff was cost money that's the one 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.169
 Greek 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.259
 So as long as the schools do not equip themselves with nine teachers we only 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 Train teachers who then dismiss to other states 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.929
 Of course it's really hard 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.269
 movement and 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.959
 no change to wait one waits 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.409
 So far, I know in five years 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.649
 Numbers are male 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.729
 Clearly 50 thousand teachers suddenly leave what men do not Arndt 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.950
 and not from the slow gearing had certain learning conditions 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.130
 certain school communication and if you can 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.459
 because it does not want to work 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.620
 then the rest is not already with age old school law could the school 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.359
 dissolve the 45-minute tact and change completely for things, no one has 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.959
 Made because you have to make the effort then how do we get them all 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.379
 can be regulated 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.600
 they went to them 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.679
 Have 520 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 structurally 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.109
 you have to say goodbye that this thing happens cost-neutral 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 many colleagues are already interested and 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.449
 visit the already traditional has come to work 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:11.989
 and try the parents 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.189
 from to take over and implant in their system 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.629
 the diocese 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.559
 Turning on a bike and you know that when you look at a resignation 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.559
 long with my job satisfaction the genome high 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.309
 it followed 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
 The team I feel I'm not working anymore 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.799
