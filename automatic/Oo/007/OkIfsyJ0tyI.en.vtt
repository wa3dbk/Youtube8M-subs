introduction to engineering drawings or
mechanical<00:00:03.870> drawings<00:00:04.410> here's<00:00:05.250> our<00:00:05.490> tools

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850

mechanical drawings here's our tools
that<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.330> need<00:00:06.649> do<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.740> remember<00:00:07.890> what<00:00:08.189> this

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
that we need do you remember what this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.120 
that we need do you remember what this
one<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.820> called<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:11.690> how<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.990> used<00:00:16.130> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
one is called and how is it used and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.160 
one is called and how is it used and
remember<00:00:17.730> when<00:00:17.910> you're<00:00:18.060> using<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.480> ruler<00:00:18.840> not

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
remember when you're using a ruler not

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.500 
remember when you're using a ruler not
to<00:00:19.410> measure<00:00:19.650> from<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.100> end<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.119> from<00:00:21.330> that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
to measure from the end but from that

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.450 
to measure from the end but from that
very<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.380> line<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
very first line that's where the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.830 
very first line that's where the
measurements<00:00:24.060> should<00:00:24.300> start<00:00:26.539> all<00:00:27.539> right<00:00:27.599> so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
measurements should start all right so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.269 
measurements should start all right so
this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.289> object<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.830> we're<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this is the object that we're going to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.519 
this is the object that we're going to
draw<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.880> three<00:00:30.539> views<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.230> need<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
draw the three views that we need to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.190 
draw the three views that we need to
show<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> top<00:00:32.309> front<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.239> right<00:00:33.719> side

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.980 

it's<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.830> little<00:00:37.100> bit<00:00:37.220> larger<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.940> isn't<00:00:38.810> going

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's a little bit larger and isn't going

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.730 
it's a little bit larger and isn't going
to<00:00:39.200> fit<00:00:39.670> on<00:00:40.670> our<00:00:40.730> paper<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.200> we're<00:00:42.380> gonna<00:00:42.500> have

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
to fit on our paper so we're gonna have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.820 
to fit on our paper so we're gonna have
to<00:00:42.770> do<00:00:43.220> is<00:00:43.520> divide<00:00:44.330> all<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.020> dimensions<00:00:45.620> by

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
to do is divide all the dimensions by

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.479 
to do is divide all the dimensions by
two<00:00:47.200> when<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:48.230> do<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.680> it'll<00:00:48.890> fit<00:00:49.220> on<00:00:49.250> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
two when I do that it'll fit on the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.890 
two when I do that it'll fit on the
paper<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.120> I'm<00:00:51.050> going<00:00:51.380> to<00:00:52.540> come<00:00:53.540> up<00:00:53.720> from<00:00:53.809> the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
paper and I'm going to come up from the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.979 
paper and I'm going to come up from the
bottom<00:00:54.410> an<00:00:54.530> inch<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.190> it'll<00:00:55.489> be<00:00:55.989> nicely

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
bottom an inch so that it'll be nicely

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.740 
bottom an inch so that it'll be nicely
spaced<00:00:57.530> on<00:00:58.100> my<00:00:58.280> drawing<00:00:58.580> and<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.450> was<00:00:59.600> my

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
spaced on my drawing and that was my

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.650 
spaced on my drawing and that was my
t-square<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.739> that's<00:01:01.129> used<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:02.480> make

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
t-square and that's used to make

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:17.020 
t-square and that's used to make
straight<00:01:03.369> horizontal<00:01:04.369> lines

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.560 

all<00:01:17.450> right<00:01:17.750> now<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:18.110> time<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.710> start<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
all right now it's time to start the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.140 
all right now it's time to start the
shape<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.049> shape<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.650> actually<00:01:22.220> six<00:01:22.610> inches

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
shape the shape is actually six inches

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.140 
shape the shape is actually six inches
long<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:24.170> I'm<00:01:24.290> gonna<00:01:24.409> draw<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:24.979> three<00:01:25.909> inches

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
long but I'm gonna draw it three inches

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.850 
long but I'm gonna draw it three inches
long<00:01:26.600> I'm<00:01:26.869> going<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.020> divide<00:01:27.259> everything<00:01:27.500> by

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
long I'm going to divide everything by

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.440 
long I'm going to divide everything by
two<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:28.490> it'll<00:01:28.670> fit<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.290> my<00:01:30.290> paper<00:01:30.710> better

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
two so it'll fit on my paper better

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.370 
two so it'll fit on my paper better
remember<00:01:32.450> when<00:01:32.600> you're<00:01:32.720> drawing<00:01:32.900> your<00:01:33.170> lines

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
remember when you're drawing your lines

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.139 
remember when you're drawing your lines
to<00:01:33.649> always<00:01:34.009> make<00:01:34.220> them<00:01:34.430> longer<00:01:34.729> than<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.119> need

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
to always make them longer than you need

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.219 
to always make them longer than you need
because<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.500> can<00:01:37.009> use<00:01:37.369> those<00:01:37.700> lines<00:01:38.030> then<00:01:38.509> in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
because you can use those lines then in

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.260 
because you can use those lines then in
the<00:01:39.590> other<00:01:39.740> views<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:43.340> notice<00:01:43.729> how<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:43.909> use<00:01:44.090> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
the other views so notice how I use the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.719 
the other views so notice how I use the
t-square<00:01:44.810> for<00:01:45.140> horizontal<00:01:45.710> lines<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.220> a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
t-square for horizontal lines and a

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.960 
t-square for horizontal lines and a
combination<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.590> T<00:01:48.830> Square<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.490> triangle

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
combination of the T Square and triangle

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.639 
combination of the T Square and triangle
for<00:01:50.630> vertical<00:01:50.990> lines<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> correct

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
for vertical lines that is the correct

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:04.760 
for vertical lines that is the correct
way<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:55.009> be<00:01:55.550> making<00:01:56.000> your<00:01:56.179> lines

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.570 

so<00:02:05.490> now<00:02:05.640> I've<00:02:05.790> measured<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.540> drawn<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.140> two

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
so now I've measured and drawn the two

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.199 
so now I've measured and drawn the two
outlines<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.179> front<00:02:09.840> face<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.209> top

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
outlines of the front face and the top

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.830 
outlines of the front face and the top
face<00:02:15.860> now<00:02:16.860> I'm<00:02:17.040> doing<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.760> side<00:02:18.120> or<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
face now I'm doing the right side or the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:30.479 
face now I'm doing the right side or the
right<00:02:19.260> view

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.449 

the<00:02:31.409> triangles<00:02:32.409> that<00:02:32.469> are<00:02:32.560> cut<00:02:32.859> out<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
the triangles that are cut out of the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.979 
the triangles that are cut out of the
shape<00:02:34.409> are<00:02:35.409> two<00:02:36.189> inches<00:02:36.670> but<00:02:36.939> I'm<00:02:37.090> using<00:02:37.569> one

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
shape are two inches but I'm using one

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.449 
shape are two inches but I'm using one
inch<00:02:38.230> again<00:02:38.620> because<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.189> divide

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
inch again because I have to divide

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.530 
inch again because I have to divide
everything<00:02:39.909> by<00:02:40.390> two<00:02:41.609> because<00:02:42.609> I'm<00:02:42.909> using<00:02:43.120> half

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
everything by two because I'm using half

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.360 
everything by two because I'm using half
scale<00:02:47.909> now<00:02:48.909> the<00:02:49.840> edges<00:02:50.409> of<00:02:50.590> those<00:02:50.739> triangle

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
scale now the edges of those triangle

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.270 
scale now the edges of those triangle
cutouts<00:02:51.700> need<00:02:51.969> to<00:02:52.150> show<00:02:52.389> up<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.810> our<00:02:53.530> side<00:02:53.920> view

wouldn't<00:03:00.129> be<00:03:00.430> able<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.879> see<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.299> it's<00:03:01.540> hidden

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
wouldn't be able to see it it's hidden

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.679 
wouldn't be able to see it it's hidden
and<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.650> backside<00:03:03.419> when<00:03:04.419> you<00:03:04.540> look

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
and it's on the backside when you look

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.640 
and it's on the backside when you look
down<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.849> one<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.419> hidden<00:03:07.870> because<00:03:08.439> you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
down this one is hidden because you

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.349 
down this one is hidden because you
wouldn't<00:03:08.980> be<00:03:09.069> able<00:03:09.159> to<00:03:09.400> see<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.939> because

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
wouldn't be able to see it because

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.649 
wouldn't be able to see it because
you're<00:03:10.510> looking<00:03:10.689> down<00:03:11.079> not<00:03:11.500> from<00:03:12.450> some<00:03:13.450> other

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
you're looking down not from some other

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.619 
you're looking down not from some other
point<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.169> view<00:03:14.609> now<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.639> need<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:16.000> erase<00:03:16.299> and

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
point of view now I need to erase and

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:25.740 
point of view now I need to erase and
clean<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.019> up<00:03:20.969> and<00:03:23.189> remember<00:03:24.189> need<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.510> write

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
clean it up and remember need to write

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.409 
clean it up and remember need to write
in<00:03:26.019> block<00:03:26.290> letters<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.010> scale<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.969> one

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
in block letters and the scale is one

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.470 
in block letters and the scale is one
inch<00:03:28.659> to<00:03:29.530> two<00:03:29.560> inches<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.549> real<00:03:30.730> life<00:03:30.969> so<00:03:31.239> one

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
inch to two inches in real life so one

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.909 
inch to two inches in real life so one
inch<00:03:31.659> on<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.930> drawing<00:03:32.200> two<00:03:33.099> inches<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:35.680> real

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
inch on the drawing two inches in real

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.220 
inch on the drawing two inches in real
life

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.110 

last<00:03:41.950> step<00:03:42.250> I'm<00:03:42.400> going<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.760> put<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.090> my

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
last step I'm going to put in my

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.800 
last step I'm going to put in my
dimensions<00:03:45.209> again<00:03:46.209> these<00:03:46.420> need<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.690> be

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
dimensions again these need to be

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.930 
dimensions again these need to be
straight<00:03:47.319> use<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:49.830> t-square<00:03:50.830> for<00:03:51.610> vertical

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
straight use the t-square for vertical

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:07.230 
straight use the t-square for vertical
lines<00:03:52.239> use<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.720> t-square<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.770> triangle

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.150 

now<00:04:07.750> I'm<00:04:07.900> writing<00:04:08.140> in<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.440> dimensions<00:04:09.010> I

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
now I'm writing in the dimensions I

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.760 
now I'm writing in the dimensions I
write<00:04:09.460> in<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.790> real-life<00:04:10.500> dimensions<00:04:11.500> not

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
write in the real-life dimensions not

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.600 
write in the real-life dimensions not
the<00:04:12.040> length<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.630> on<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.990> paper<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:15.400> the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
the length that is on the paper but the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.420 
the length that is on the paper but the
real-life<00:04:17.220> actual<00:04:18.720> dimensions<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:19.840> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
real-life actual dimensions of the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:39.880 
real-life actual dimensions of the
object

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.240 

as<00:04:41.780> you're<00:04:42.780> doing<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.200> dimensions<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:44.010> do

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
as you're doing the dimensions you do

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.730 
as you're doing the dimensions you do
not<00:04:44.430> put<00:04:44.910> dimensions<00:04:45.540> on<00:04:45.750> everything<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
not put dimensions on everything you

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.260 
not put dimensions on everything you
only<00:04:47.010> put<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.270> dimensions<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.140> you<00:04:49.470> need

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
only put in the dimensions that you need

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.560 
only put in the dimensions that you need
to<00:04:51.270> figure<00:04:51.510> it<00:04:51.810> out<00:04:52.700> notice<00:04:53.700> I<00:04:53.850> didn't<00:04:54.120> put<00:04:54.150> any

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
to figure it out notice I didn't put any

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.020 
to figure it out notice I didn't put any
dimensions<00:04:55.170> on<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.470> top<00:04:55.710> view<00:04:55.980> because<00:04:56.850> that

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
dimensions on the top view because that

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.290 
dimensions on the top view because that
information<00:04:57.240> shows<00:04:58.200> up<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.460> front<00:04:59.760> view<00:05:00.030> I

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
information shows up in the front view I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.440 
information shows up in the front view I
don't<00:05:00.480> need<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.380> twice<00:05:01.590> just<00:05:02.450> put

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
don't need to do it twice just put

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:15.180 
don't need to do it twice just put
enough<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:04.860> people<00:05:05.250> will<00:05:05.400> understand
