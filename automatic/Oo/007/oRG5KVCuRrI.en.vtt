00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.430 
continuing to improve the engine with is
global<00:03:24.880> illumination<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.989> can<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
global illumination you can see the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.990 
global illumination you can see the
lighting<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:26.980> gears<00:03:27.160> two<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.489> good<00:03:27.700> but<00:03:27.880> we

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
lighting and gears two is good but we

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.979 
lighting and gears two is good but we
felt<00:03:28.209> like<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.390> could<00:03:28.480> really<00:03:28.600> bring<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.930> to

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
felt like we could really bring it to

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.330 
felt like we could really bring it to
the<00:03:29.080> next<00:03:29.170> level<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.769> have<00:03:29.950> better<00:03:30.130> balance

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the next level to have better balance

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.580 
the next level to have better balance
lights<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.299> have<00:03:31.390> kind<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.870> better<00:03:32.140> ambient

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
lights to have kind of a better ambient

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.530 
lights to have kind of a better ambient
light<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.010> when<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.670> see<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.000> environments

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
light and when you see the environments

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.180 
light and when you see the environments
and<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.780> can<00:03:34.900> see<00:03:35.109> how<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.320> texture<00:03:35.859> is<00:03:35.950> kind

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
and you can see how the texture is kind

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.280 
and you can see how the texture is kind
of<00:03:36.250> pop<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.489> come<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.850> life<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.810> really<00:03:37.989> makes

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
of pop and come to life it really makes

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.810 
of pop and come to life it really makes
a<00:03:38.380> huge<00:03:38.500> difference<00:03:38.769> or<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.280> mean<00:03:39.489> there's<00:03:39.670> also

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
a huge difference or I mean there's also

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.490 
a huge difference or I mean there's also
all<00:03:40.329> sorts<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.720> other<00:03:40.840> things<00:03:40.959> we're<00:03:41.320> adding

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
all sorts of other things we're adding

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.349 
all sorts of other things we're adding
it<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.620> increase<00:03:42.010> kind<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.549> color<00:03:43.060> depth

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
it to increase kind of the color depth

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.210 
it to increase kind of the color depth
in<00:03:43.540> regards<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.019> allowing<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.530> better

post-processing peeking from the artists

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.650 
post-processing peeking from the artists
better<00:03:47.890> tools<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.370> improve<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.420> know<00:03:49.540> the

thing kind of out of it I assure you
that<00:04:18.840> when<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.019> see<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.560> real<00:04:19.980> time<00:04:20.160> gameplay

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
that when you see the real time gameplay

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.520 
that when you see the real time gameplay
that<00:04:20.760> we<00:04:20.910> are<00:04:21.209> doing<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.660> Gears<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:21.959> War<00:04:22.049> 3<00:04:22.139> that

that we are doing a Gears of War 3 that

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.200 
that we are doing a Gears of War 3 that
it<00:04:22.710> looks<00:04:22.950> at<00:04:23.100> very<00:04:23.400> very<00:04:23.610> great<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.060> looks

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
it looks at very very great and looks

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.000 
it looks at very very great and looks
even<00:04:24.780> better<00:04:24.870> than<00:04:25.050> gears<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.440> date<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:25.800> yeah

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
even better than gears to date so yeah

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.250 
even better than gears to date so yeah
we're<00:04:26.220> pushing<00:04:26.400> up<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.610> n<00:04:26.880> plus<00:04:27.180> for<00:04:28.050> a

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
we're pushing up the n plus for a

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.879 
we're pushing up the n plus for a
creative<00:04:28.620> capacity<00:04:29.160> 11<00:04:29.310> that's<00:04:29.910> correct<00:04:30.889> I

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
creative capacity 11 that's correct I

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.560 
creative capacity 11 that's correct I
think<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.460> can<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:32.760> said<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.030> was<00:04:33.150> expect

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
think you can you said it was expect

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.200 
think you can you said it was expect
everybody<00:04:34.110> was<00:04:34.380> expecting<00:04:34.590> for<00:04:35.210> Christmas

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
everybody was expecting for Christmas

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.270 
everybody was expecting for Christmas
this<00:04:36.360> year<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.380> have<00:04:37.560> any<00:04:37.710> special<00:04:37.889> reason

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
this year so you have any special reason

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.250 
this year so you have any special reason
to<00:04:38.700> move<00:04:39.510> into<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:41.660> well<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:42.690> think<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:43.169> you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
to move into this well I think if you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.629 
to move into this well I think if you
look<00:04:43.470> at<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.860> way<00:04:44.040> that<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.280> video<00:04:44.490> game

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
look at the way that the video game

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.159 
look at the way that the video game
industry<00:04:44.760> traditionally<00:04:45.090> has<00:04:45.570> panned<00:04:45.810> out<00:04:45.930> in

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
industry traditionally has panned out in

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.990 
industry traditionally has panned out in
regards<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.620> release<00:04:46.889> dates<00:04:47.160> holiday<00:04:47.850> has

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
regards to release dates holiday has

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.750 
regards to release dates holiday has
become<00:04:48.300> just<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.720> total<00:04:49.400> traffic<00:04:50.400> jam

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
become just a total traffic jam

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.610 
become just a total traffic jam
everybody's<00:04:51.720> trying<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.020> cram<00:04:52.290> their<00:04:52.440> games
