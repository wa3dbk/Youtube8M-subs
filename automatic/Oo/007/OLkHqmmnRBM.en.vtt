 it is first of all to love this beautiful

 will do so it's not a big front 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.410
 it's a will maybe make a coat that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 you have a hard time assuming the first 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.629
 advice that I give you this forehead cm and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.369
 love you as you are then 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.060
 little tips to showcase 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.040
 your face and your forehead if you want it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 to hide a little bit I propose to you 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 to make a fringe a bangs maybe 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.820
 not thick but a little shifted a little and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 so please ask your 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 barber more details but what I 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.000
 advise it's an asymmetrical fringe 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 with a course point and some wicks 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 longer on the side or very slender 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 that's an option I did not want 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.320
 cut you a few moments ago but 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.820
 we must not forget that the girls that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.369
 big bottom is a sign of intelligence 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.229
 it seems quite well done so he 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.579
 must be put in exact value - it 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.890
 must be highlighted it must be 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.659
 sublime and we are not talking about hiding this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.229
 front but to sublimate this front for the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.899
 showcase 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.720
 so little wick here are small wicks 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.870
 tapered and then if you are afraid of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.670
 cut them 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.860
 definitely we have the option of 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.560
 try fake bangs it here 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.680
 exist we have accessories I can 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.330
 of course show streets of voila voila 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.870
 it's more is a bangs 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.450
 wig 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.730
 it's a funny bangs voice put them 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
 to remove at will so we can 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.450
 tapered and then that makes it possible to test or 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.860
 simply to wear as a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.760
 accessory then levis you also have 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.650
 the headband makes the joints with 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.330
 with the hairpiece exactly that allows 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.220
 to have a first approach to see 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.380
 what we actually look like with a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.900
 frank that's it that's it that's very 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.260
