welcome to Laney Henson stove project
today<00:00:03.959> I'm<00:00:04.350> using<00:00:04.589> bamboo<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.609> fuel<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.509 
today I'm using bamboo for fuel in the
hybrid<00:00:07.140> stove<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.830> pan<00:00:08.099> fry<00:00:08.370> eggs<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:10.099> will<00:00:11.099> use

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
hybrid stove to pan fry eggs I will use

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.900 
hybrid stove to pan fry eggs I will use
some<00:00:12.240> small<00:00:12.780> pieces<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.740> candle<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.880> light

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
some small pieces and a candle to light

the<00:00:15.330> burner

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
the burner

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.779 
the burner
once<00:00:17.250> that's<00:00:18.240> lit<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.260> will<00:00:19.590> add<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.070> gasifier

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
once that's lit I will add the gasifier

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.340 
once that's lit I will add the gasifier
section<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:23.130> pot<00:00:23.400> module<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.840> add<00:00:25.019> some

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
section and the pot module to add some

draft notice how the fire picks up when

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.340 
draft notice how the fire picks up when
I<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:31.170> pot<00:00:31.439> module<00:00:31.980> adds<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.520> updraft<00:00:33.079> to<00:00:34.079> get

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I the pot module adds an updraft to get

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.380 
I the pot module adds an updraft to get
the<00:00:34.469> fire<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.309> drive<00:00:35.700> off<00:00:35.940> some

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the fire going and drive off some

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.990 
the fire going and drive off some
moisture<00:00:37.280> now<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.940> add<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.450> pan<00:00:39.719> module

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
moisture now I will add the pan module

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
moisture now I will add the pan module
the<00:00:42.000> pan<00:00:42.329> module<00:00:42.960> creates<00:00:43.590> about<00:00:43.920> 12<00:00:44.370> inches

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the pan module creates about 12 inches

the pan module creates about 12 inches
of<00:00:44.879> draft<00:00:48.469> next<00:00:49.469> goes<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.190> pan<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.840> will

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of draft next goes the pan and I will

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
of draft next goes the pan and I will
give<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.559> 30<00:00:52.949> seconds<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> warm<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.149> before<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
give that 30 seconds to warm up before I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:06.030 
give that 30 seconds to warm up before I
add<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.199> eggs

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.350 

I<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:09.010> an<00:01:09.160> electric<00:01:09.430> oven<00:01:10.030> with<00:01:10.330> a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
I have an electric oven with a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.850 
I have an electric oven with a
thermostatically-controlled

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
thermostatically-controlled

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.940 
thermostatically-controlled
I<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.790> from<00:01:13.660> experience

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
I and from experience

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.730 
I and from experience
it<00:01:15.250> looks<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:16.240> an<00:01:16.810> temperature<00:01:17.500> is

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
it looks like the an temperature is

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.260 
it looks like the an temperature is
about<00:01:18.420> 275<00:01:19.420> degrees<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.850> not<00:01:22.000> hot<00:01:22.240> enough

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
about 275 degrees this is not hot enough

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.300 
about 275 degrees this is not hot enough
for<00:01:22.510> pancakes<00:01:23.170> or<00:01:23.590> tortillas<00:01:26.070> let's<00:01:27.070> take<00:01:27.280> a

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
for pancakes or tortillas let's take a

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:37.380 
for pancakes or tortillas let's take a
look<00:01:27.580> at<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.790> fire<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:36.460> looks<00:01:36.700> like<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.090> pan

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
look at the fire it looks like the pan

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.520 
look at the fire it looks like the pan
is<00:01:37.720> cooking<00:01:38.170> at<00:01:38.470> about<00:01:38.800> medium<00:01:39.190> heat<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.900> might

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
is cooking at about medium heat I might

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.130 
is cooking at about medium heat I might
have<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.800> make<00:01:41.920> some<00:01:41.979> changes<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:43.450> get<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
have to make some changes to get the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.140 
have to make some changes to get the
temperature<00:01:44.680> up<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:46.229> tortillas<00:01:48.150> pancakes

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
temperature up for tortillas pancakes

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.170 
temperature up for tortillas pancakes
and<00:01:49.450> jurors<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.729> foods<00:01:51.940> that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and jurors and some of the foods that

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.770 
and jurors and some of the foods that
need<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.750> high<00:01:53.050> temperatures<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:55.150> eggs<00:01:55.450> are

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
need a high temperatures the eggs are

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.650 
need a high temperatures the eggs are
done<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.100> looks<00:01:57.310> like<00:01:57.550> there's<00:01:58.240> fewer

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
done and it looks like there's fewer

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.969 
done and it looks like there's fewer
left<00:01:59.190> for<00:02:00.190> more<00:02:00.550> cooking<00:02:01.000> tasks<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.840> will<00:02:02.710> just

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
left for more cooking tasks I will just

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.200 
left for more cooking tasks I will just
wait<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.360> fire<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:05.140> burn<00:02:05.320> out<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.790> side

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
wait for the fire to burn out the side
