because<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.640> was<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.850> glitch<00:03:03.210> which<00:03:03.630> i

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
because there was that glitch which i

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.040 
because there was that glitch which i
think<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.590> was<00:03:04.710> hive<00:03:04.950> disrupter<00:03:05.670> was<00:03:06.050> messing

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
think it was hive disrupter was messing

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.600 
think it was hive disrupter was messing
up<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.470> they<00:03:07.590> took<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:07.800> away<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.430> could

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
up so they took it away so you could

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.400 
up so they took it away so you could
never<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:08.970> fully<00:03:09.420> upgrade<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.140> they

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
never actually fully upgrade it and they

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.990 
never actually fully upgrade it and they
fixed<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.010> then<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> couple<00:03:11.670> weeks<00:03:11.820> later

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
fixed it and then a couple weeks later

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300 
fixed it and then a couple weeks later
house<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.630> wolves<00:03:12.720> came<00:03:13.020> out<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.470> i<00:03:13.500> had<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.010> get

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
house of wolves came out so i had to get

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.490 
house of wolves came out so i had to get
in<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.430> third<00:03:14.610> light<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.000> upgrade<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.750> so

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
in a third light to upgrade that and so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.740 
in a third light to upgrade that and so
I've<00:03:16.620> hardly<00:03:16.920> ever<00:03:17.040> seen<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.850> the

I've hardly ever seen that with the
yellow<00:03:19.200> border<00:03:19.440> around<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:20.520> now<00:03:20.880> we've

about upgrading what's called the 8th

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.360 
about upgrading what's called the 8th
eons<00:04:25.440> epilogue<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.190> void<00:04:26.520> or

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
eons epilogue the void or

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.159 
eons epilogue the void or
auto<00:04:27.490> rifle<00:04:28.000> from<00:04:28.180> both<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.540> glass<00:04:28.780> just

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
auto rifle from both the glass just

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.560 
auto rifle from both the glass just
because<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> only<00:04:30.010> voice<00:04:30.310> primary<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.060> have<00:04:31.389> at

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
because the only voice primary I have at

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.129 
because the only voice primary I have at
the<00:04:31.660> moment<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:33.610> word<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:34.000> crota<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.020> I'm

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
the moment is the word of crota and I'm

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.810 
the moment is the word of crota and I'm
not<00:04:35.290> really<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.530> fan<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.160> weapon<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.639> just

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
not really a fan of that weapon I just

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.070 
not really a fan of that weapon I just
don't<00:04:36.970> like<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.180> way<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.419> looks<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.900> way<00:04:37.990> it

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
don't like the way it looks the way it

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.840 
don't like the way it looks the way it
handles<00:04:38.530> I'm<00:04:38.710> just<00:04:39.160> not<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.370> fan<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.639> that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
handles I'm just not a fan of that

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.520 
handles I'm just not a fan of that
weapon<00:04:40.060> so<00:04:40.389> it'd<00:04:40.510> be<00:04:40.540> nice<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.840> have<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.169> void

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
weapon so it'd be nice to have a void

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.350 
weapon so it'd be nice to have a void
primary<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.370> use<00:04:42.580> whenever<00:04:42.850> there's<00:04:43.150> void

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
primary to use whenever there's void

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.680 
primary to use whenever there's void
burn<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.740> know<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.419> eighth<00:04:46.419> yawns

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
burn and I know the eighth yawns

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.870 
burn and I know the eighth yawns
epilogue<00:04:47.110> was<00:04:47.290> never<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.949> very<00:04:48.370> good<00:04:48.699> of<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
epilogue was never that very good of the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.909 
epilogue was never that very good of the
weapon<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:49.840> i'm<00:04:49.930> wondering<00:04:50.110> if<00:04:50.560> anyone's

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
weapon but i'm wondering if anyone's

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.800 
weapon but i'm wondering if anyone's
fully<00:04:51.190> upgraded<00:04:51.729> it<00:04:51.850> with<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.150> third<00:04:52.510> light

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810
