00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
I both welcome to chapter 8 we've got

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.150 
I both welcome to chapter 8 we've got
the<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:10.469> grade

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
the first grade

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
the first grade
broken<00:00:11.760> down<00:00:11.940> we've<00:00:12.750> got<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> stand<00:00:13.380> out<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
broken down we've got the stand out and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.429 
broken down we've got the stand out and
we<00:00:14.099> sit<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.429> up<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> side<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.540> couple<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
we sit it up on the side a couple of

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.800 
we sit it up on the side a couple of
small<00:00:16.710> things<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.880> don't<00:00:18.060> remember<00:00:18.450> reading

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
small things we I don't remember reading

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.180 
small things we I don't remember reading
I<00:00:19.170> may<00:00:19.380> well<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.830> missed<00:00:20.040> it<00:00:20.250> but<00:00:20.390> that<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
I may well have missed it but that the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.370 
I may well have missed it but that the
sand<00:00:23.190> is<00:00:23.430> bolted<00:00:23.880> down<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> pallet<00:00:24.840> makes

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
sand is bolted down to the pallet makes

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.590 
sand is bolted down to the pallet makes
a<00:00:25.500> lot<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.830> sense<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:27.240> thing<00:00:27.420> we

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
a lot of sense but the first thing we

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.140 
a lot of sense but the first thing we
tried<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.320> screwed<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.920> thought<00:00:29.160> no<00:00:29.789> way<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
tried to screwed it we thought no way is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.580 
tried to screwed it we thought no way is
is<00:00:30.300> saying<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.689> ending<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.349> take<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
is saying that ending and then we take a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
is saying that ending and then we take a
quick<00:00:31.830> peek<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.250> saw<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:33.360> holes<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.720> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
quick peek and saw two holes in the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.740 
quick peek and saw two holes in the
bottom<00:00:34.199> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.300> video<00:00:36.690> mentioned

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bottom and then as the video mentioned

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.959 
bottom and then as the video mentioned
there's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> ton<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> stuff<00:00:37.950> inside<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.730> three

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
there's a ton of stuff inside the three

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's a ton of stuff inside the three
different<00:00:39.329> doors<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.930> me<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.010> Stan<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.640> we

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
different doors of me and Stan so we

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.450 
different doors of me and Stan so we
took<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.210> stuff<00:00:42.270> out<00:00:43.040> took<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> doors

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
took all that stuff out took the doors

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.030 
took all that stuff out took the doors
on<00:00:44.700> check<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> decide<00:00:46.290> we<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
on check up on the decide we put it on a

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.799 
on check up on the decide we put it on a
old<00:00:47.850> towel<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.809> try<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> keep<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> nice<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
old towel just try to keep it nice and

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
old towel just try to keep it nice and
let's<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> next<00:00:52.440> step<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
let's see here the next step is going to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.709 
let's see here the next step is going to
be<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.570> take<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.170> plank<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.100> lithium<00:00:56.520> grease

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
be to take the plank some lithium grease

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.100 
be to take the plank some lithium grease
and<00:00:57.719> grease<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.360> wheels<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> feet<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
and grease up the wheels and the feet so

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.950 
and grease up the wheels and the feet so
that<00:01:01.140> they'll<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:02.329> adjustable<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> future

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that they'll be adjustable in the future

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.680 
that they'll be adjustable in the future
otherwise<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:04.800> cast-iron<00:01:05.309> threads<00:01:05.759> could

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
otherwise these cast-iron threads could

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.420 
otherwise these cast-iron threads could
be<00:01:06.810> prone<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.229> rusting<00:01:07.649> and<00:01:07.800> they<00:01:07.920> won't<00:01:08.130> budge

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
be prone to rusting and they won't budge

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.920 
be prone to rusting and they won't budge
so<00:01:10.189> we'll<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.640> we'll<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.630> but

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so we'll do that and we'll be back but

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
so we'll do that and we'll be back but
that's<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:13.530> part<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> chapter

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that's it for the first part of chapter

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
that's it for the first part of chapter
eight<00:01:17.330> all<00:01:18.330> right<00:01:18.540> chapter<00:01:18.990> 8<00:01:19.140> continued

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
eight all right chapter 8 continued

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.300 
eight all right chapter 8 continued
we've<00:01:20.460> got<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> stand<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> feet<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we've got the stand the feet on with the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.240 
we've got the stand the feet on with the
lithium<00:01:23.520> grease<00:01:24.470> move<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> stand<00:01:25.920> over<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
lithium grease move the stand over to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
lithium grease move the stand over to
the<00:01:26.369> approximate<00:01:26.640> place<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:28.229> need<00:01:28.409> about

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the approximate place you need about

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.070 
the approximate place you need about
eight<00:01:29.340> inches<00:01:29.790> between<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.420> stand<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
eight inches between the stand and the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.950 
eight inches between the stand and the
wall<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.250> allows<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> y-axis

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
wall which is allows for the y-axis

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.880 
wall which is allows for the y-axis
stepper<00:01:34.680> motor<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:36.390> next<00:01:36.840> step<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.829> be

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
stepper motor and the next step will be

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
stepper motor and the next step will be
to<00:01:39.409> break<00:01:40.409> down<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:41.159> cut<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.880> pallet<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
to break down or cut down the pallet you

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
to break down or cut down the pallet you
know<00:01:43.770> saws<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.270> someone<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
know saws off for this I need someone I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.690 
know saws off for this I need someone I
didn't<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> buy<00:01:47.159> an<00:01:47.460> expensive

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
didn't really want to buy an expensive

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
didn't really want to buy an expensive
one<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.479> pick<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.950> Harbor<00:01:50.280> Freight

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
one so pick this up at Harbor Freight

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.030 
one so pick this up at Harbor Freight
for<00:01:50.990> $29<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> 20%<00:01:52.979> coupon<00:01:53.810> off<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
for $29 with a 20% coupon off that so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
for $29 with a 20% coupon off that so
hard<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> argue<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> yeah<00:01:57.479> it's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
hard to argue with that yeah it's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.200 
hard to argue with that yeah it's
probably<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.170> piece<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> junk<00:01:58.710> but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
probably a piece of junk but

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.260 
probably a piece of junk but
certainly<00:01:59.450> work<00:01:59.630> for<00:01:59.900> now<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.159> guess<00:02:01.970> it'll

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
certainly work for now I guess it'll

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.500 
certainly work for now I guess it'll
work<00:02:02.780> longer<00:02:03.170> than<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.409> needed<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:05.360> one

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
work longer than I needed to but one

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.910 
work longer than I needed to but one
thing<00:02:05.659> I<00:02:05.720> wanted<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.049> highlight<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:06.770> is

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
thing I wanted to highlight and this is

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.529 
thing I wanted to highlight and this is
the<00:02:06.979> first<00:02:07.220> thing<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.490> tormach<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.330> done

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
the first thing that tormach is done

year I've seen one in person but

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.240 
year I've seen one in person but
obviously<00:02:39.050> when<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.410> don't<00:02:39.590> own<00:02:39.800> one<00:02:40.070> you

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
obviously when you don't own one you

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.610 
obviously when you don't own one you
don't<00:02:40.430> always<00:02:40.640> notice<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.209> nuances<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.050> I

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't always notice the nuances and I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.250 
don't always notice the nuances and I
didn't<00:02:43.010> notice<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.900> photograph<00:02:44.900> in

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260

in it's just a better stand so it's a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
little frustrating that the engine hoist

little frustrating that the engine hoist
isn't<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.049> work<00:03:09.200> as<00:03:09.470> smoothly<00:03:10.459> as<00:03:10.880> I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
isn't going to work as smoothly as I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.949 
isn't going to work as smoothly as I
thought<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.360> would<00:03:11.540> what<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.590> need<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.950> do<00:03:13.160> is

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
thought it would what you need to do is

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.220 
thought it would what you need to do is
crimp<00:03:14.959> up<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.530> feet<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.269> two<00:03:17.810> legs

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230

dust<00:05:24.730> of<00:05:25.300> getting<00:05:25.720> up<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.020> ball<00:05:26.200> screws<00:05:26.530> or

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
dust of getting up in the ball screws or

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.970 
dust of getting up in the ball screws or
making<00:05:27.070> its<00:05:27.190> way<00:05:27.400> into<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.360> mill<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.830> would

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
making its way into the mill so it would

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.760 
making its way into the mill so it would
be<00:05:30.130> probably<00:05:30.430> half<00:05:30.790> an<00:05:30.970> hour<00:05:31.290> and<00:05:32.290> so

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
be probably half an hour and so

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.560 
be probably half an hour and so
hopefully<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.280> other<00:05:33.370> side<00:05:33.610> easier<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.390> good

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
hopefully the other side easier the good

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.630 
hopefully the other side easier the good
news<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.960> that<00:05:34.990> if<00:05:35.650> you<00:05:35.740> look<00:05:35.950> under<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.250> stand

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
news is that if you look under the stand

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.260 
news is that if you look under the stand
I<00:05:36.940> think<00:05:37.110> those<00:05:38.110> plus<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.190> 2x4<00:05:39.880> will<00:05:40.150> be

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
I think those plus and 2x4 will be

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.240 
I think those plus and 2x4 will be
enough<00:05:40.570> height<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:41.350> get<00:05:41.470> my<00:05:41.680> engine<00:05:42.070> voice

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
enough height to get my engine voice

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.980 
enough height to get my engine voice
underneath<00:05:42.730> it<00:05:42.970> I'll<00:05:43.330> probably<00:05:43.660> end<00:05:43.930> up

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
underneath it I'll probably end up

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.990 
underneath it I'll probably end up
screwing<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.590> 2x4<00:05:45.100> into<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.520> just<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:45.970> that

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
screwing the 2x4 into it just so that

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.910 
screwing the 2x4 into it just so that
nothing<00:05:46.870> slips<00:05:47.440> around<00:05:47.680> that's<00:05:48.250> all<00:05:49.920> alright

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
nothing slips around that's all alright

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.360 
nothing slips around that's all alright

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
the crane there are a few things you we

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.940 
the crane there are a few things you we
need<00:05:59.230> to<00:05:59.350> do<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.880> first<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.690> figure<00:06:02.620> out<00:06:02.680> the

need to do the first is figure out the
proper<00:06:03.280> table<00:06:03.730> alignment<00:06:04.690> position<00:06:04.780> it

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
proper table alignment position it

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.440 
proper table alignment position it
sounds<00:06:06.160> like<00:06:06.310> you're<00:06:06.490> supposed<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:07.030> look<00:06:07.300> at

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
sounds like you're supposed to look at

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.240 
sounds like you're supposed to look at
the<00:06:07.570> pictures<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.200> tormach<00:06:08.530> provides<00:06:08.920> but

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
the pictures the tormach provides but

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.340 
the pictures the tormach provides but
also<00:06:09.400> it's<00:06:10.270> a<00:06:10.390> little<00:06:10.660> bit<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:10.870> a<00:06:10.960> feedback

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
also it's a little bit of a feedback

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.710 
also it's a little bit of a feedback
process<00:06:11.860> where<00:06:12.040> you<00:06:12.790> get<00:06:12.910> it<00:06:13.030> close<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.600> then

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
process where you get it close and then

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.750 
process where you get it close and then
when<00:06:13.840> you<00:06:13.930> lift<00:06:14.200> up<00:06:14.350> you<00:06:14.560> may<00:06:14.680> see<00:06:14.740> how<00:06:15.550> your

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
when you lift up you may see how your

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.370 
when you lift up you may see how your
balance<00:06:16.210> so<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:18.390> x-axis<00:06:19.390> a<00:06:19.750> line<00:06:19.990> that<00:06:20.200> looks

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
balance so the x-axis a line that looks

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.620 
balance so the x-axis a line that looks
like<00:06:20.710> this<00:06:20.950> is<00:06:21.100> pretty<00:06:21.280> much<00:06:21.400> correct<00:06:21.700> what's

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
like this is pretty much correct what's

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.940 
like this is pretty much correct what's
interesting<00:06:22.900> is<00:06:23.170> you<00:06:23.260> need<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.470> be<00:06:23.560> careful

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
interesting is you need to be careful

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.200 
interesting is you need to be careful
that<00:06:24.070> you<00:06:24.160> don't<00:06:24.250> end<00:06:24.460> up<00:06:24.520> knock<00:06:24.820> into<00:06:25.180> the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
that you don't end up knock into the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.050 
that you don't end up knock into the
z-axis<00:06:25.630> stepper<00:06:26.260> but<00:06:26.980> um<00:06:27.160> you<00:06:27.730> come<00:06:27.940> around

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
z-axis stepper but um you come around

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.680 
z-axis stepper but um you come around
here<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.690> can<00:06:28.870> see<00:06:29.580> what<00:06:30.580> we<00:06:30.700> need<00:06:30.850> to<00:06:30.970> do<00:06:31.150> is

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
here you can see what we need to do is

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.230 
here you can see what we need to do is
move<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.260> table<00:06:32.710> back<00:06:33.250> in<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.700> wide<00:06:33.910> position

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
move the table back in the wide position

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.260 
move the table back in the wide position
the<00:06:34.720> spindle<00:06:35.260> needs<00:06:35.860> to<00:06:36.070> be<00:06:36.250> roughly<00:06:36.850> over

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
the spindle needs to be roughly over

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.840 
the spindle needs to be roughly over
this<00:06:38.170> area<00:06:38.500> according<00:06:38.920> to<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.190> photo<00:06:39.400> so<00:06:39.700> what

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
this area according to the photo so what

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.240 
this area according to the photo so what
we<00:06:40.000> do<00:06:40.180> is<00:06:40.510> we<00:06:41.380> stick<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:41.950> piece

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
we do is we stick a piece

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.720 
we do is we stick a piece

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
the joint here for the y-axis and will

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.380 
the joint here for the y-axis and will
rotate<00:06:56.900> that<00:06:57.320> with<00:06:57.590> a<00:06:57.620> pair<00:06:57.890> of<00:06:58.150> channel<00:06:59.150> locks
