00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 heil hello everyone is welcome 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.009
 for a new live on call of duty 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.710
 today's black ops we end up 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.150
 with the ivo scorpion plus we are on 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.920
 jacked rails so that's rather the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.509
 good news the bad news 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 of today is that my connection is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.020
 no one to shit for about two 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.430
 weeks and it will still last for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.080
 a little month and that's a little bit 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.910
 plus it's a little bit boring 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.020
 just because it's not it's not 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.279
 how long it is to suck 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.660
 problem is that she is not at all 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 stable is not at all stable george 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 by that I mean peaks at 3002 ping 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 I think I'm lucky there 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 it seems to be pretty good 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.350
 but I think it's okay I hope that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.649
 will be fine for the end of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.690
 part 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.070
 but it's true that it's really very 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.230
 very boring does if you want my 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 download is very good actually and I 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.530
 I do not have a rotten thing that I have a jet 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.870
 at 1 5 mega disgusting but we get 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 the problem is not the 5 mega the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.410
 problem is that the claude is not zero 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.129
 to shit is that it is completely 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 unstable 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.789
 it's just completely unstable from 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 knock down times I have ten kilos of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.050
 times I have 50 kg of times I have nothing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.829
 everything and when I have nothing at all it can 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.539
 last long 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.030
 his Peugeot hard and I do not know it can 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.260
 really lasted a long time that any kind 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.210
 20 30 seconds which is literally 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590
 impossible for down to play for 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.700
 do anything in fact at 20 30 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.740
 seconds anyway we lose the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 connection on cÃ¨ze it's a little bit 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 boring I can get to play this amazingly 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 I can play better this is what played 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.350
 to code 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.330
 I really have trouble playing side by side on 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.290
 connections like that especially that the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.390
 most of the time when I try to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.939
 connect it does not even want it's actually 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 quite complicated dc dc blow by 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.540
 early July I will find a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 normal connection the only problem is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.630
 that ba have to wait a little month 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.579
 so suddenly in a month I will try 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.350
 to offer you videos like 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.000
 usually but I guarantee you nothing 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.540
 you not guarantee that I will succeed in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 offer you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.310
 three videos a week from here during 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.780
 a month especially saw him the weather he 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 must for more than one video I you 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.170
 do not even tell it's enough 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.790
 impressive or pretty much between going 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.399
 between 15 and 24 hours for a plot of 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.799
 less than 10 minutes of video what is 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.399
 or this little and schott was fine 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.020
 nice 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.369
 so you really need a lot of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.960
 time and necessarily low that says 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.130
 lot while I am in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.479
 less deposits and I may be able to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.759
 Videos - Ong Georges returns from the skin 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.650
 of a little stop for example but 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.300
 how to say a 45 minute game 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.399
 for the squad would put roughly 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.200
 five or six days it's just me it's 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.400
 not even worth it I will not even 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.350
 tried i'll wait to get better than 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.610
 a better co and in the meantime I try 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.020
 to offer you videos a little 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.380
 shorter kind five ten minutes not 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.630
 more 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.890
 either I do not know if I'm going to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.160
 do a little bit less so we'll see 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.900
 well, we'll see what will happen 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.190
 we'll see we'll see in due time because 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.690
 that anyway I can not predict 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.040
 normally I should have I had 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.860
 find a gossip I will not tell 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.180
 until my demon drones at the end of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.410
 mandate will not fail normally 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.720
 I should regain mega growth 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.709
 100 mega of one of the hottest boots I 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.940
 do not know how to get up alone 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.250
 since I actually play I'm going to be at 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.100
 about 3 meters from the dispatcher so I 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.180
 will have vdsl but I do not know I 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.060
 do not know how much I 'll upload 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.410
 I do not know if it's 10 mega people at 30 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.850
 may gafa short anyway I want 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.050
 to tell you I would have plenty of 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.270
 to do everything I need there 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.410
 will have more problem is good of any 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.910
 way right now I have a lot of 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.220
 taff so that falls pretty well I have not 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.860
 to correct the taf so the perfect nothing 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.180
 to say but well in the meantime it's a 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.040
 little bit is still a little bit 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.330
 disabling we will say that I would have 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.380
 favorite I would have preferred to keep a 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.730
 normal ball but I make you a 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.470
 small test a small s ii that at the end of 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.610
 the video by the way I think you 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.040
 go a little deluded do not know 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.810
 it 's not on the baiia is already 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 got to talk it's not just about 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.950
 the on the flow that you will see 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.750
 it's also about the quality of the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.030
 high and serious connection with my c4 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.320
 in the world ya learns referred it is especially 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.730
 on the quality the connections because 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.560
 when you go to actually see the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.300
 download is going to be pretty drinkable 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.510
 but the claude you'll see that it's okay 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.580
 be 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.720
 I have a 100% chance that you will do it 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 live anyway I know I have 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.959
 100% chance that it does not work 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.720
 you see it's so horrible as 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.450
 connection that no and so just not 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.610
 possible in fact so bah we go we go 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.200
 will see well we're fine 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.880
 normally give any way in here a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.430
 little month that should all should 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.570
 get back into order and we must have 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.220
 a connection in management does not come out 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.140
 bad for a bit rotten connection that 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.620
 I felt goyer it's a little it's a 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.519
 little connection cardboard connection but 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.690
 it still happens when I arrive when 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.920
 even do business as soon as he has 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.000
 it's okay or there I have not seen where he 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.019
 came out him by cons I believe he 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.940
 was coming out right in front of me I got 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.989
 returned at the same time it's not the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.310
 good idea to turn around at this time 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.959
 there in this file suddenly I had 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.480
 almost Arab world one fire and I 'm going 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.169
 a little bit missed but good 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.510
 host what happens to him is a 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.440
 little shock like that there you'll see if you 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.699
 make passes and your head you know 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.810
 not what you expect but you have to 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.320
 expect a little cat so done 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.490
 overtake that head 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.400
 aulas the man and this guy is fat a 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.900
 it's him who swayed me the c4 so we 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.070
 has a big bastard actually going phase 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.610
 we will go around to go to him 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.070
 fart 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.250
 the guy who lmg I do not know if he has 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.470
 target finder or what but lmg more more 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.280
 the c4 plus machin what the fuck good 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.960
 Come on we're not going right now 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.940
 because there of a little bit of the world 1 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.860
 we will wait for the world to pass then 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.699
 we will go to water quietly his 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.030
 apartment when you're upstairs 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.550
 in general you do not have too many problems in 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:58.350
 general here but he with salam I 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.520
 still have you had dead ez wheel 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.139
 a second the guys who gets up to 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.330
 how does it go about 73 to go 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.190
 costs two points 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.850
 where are you little sweet eyes and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.220
 last two points 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.419
 last point speech paying the end of 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.770
 the map for the last point at the age of 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.940
 blocks mason trigano damage I would have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.810
 well liked I would have liked to see her 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.210
 before but hey I do not even know how much 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.350
 I did two kills with masen trigun 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.610
 with the one I asked in the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.690
 pool there because one general I the 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.280
 not pose in the pool because the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.900
 pool is a little bit needed a little 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.099
 down she is not very should she is 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.380
 Raised actually passed once she 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.520
 not see everything and she loses a lot of 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.229
 kiel like that in general I fund in 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.270
 in the middle since 1 I'm trying to 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.010
 cover a little bit it works but good yeah 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.150
 so I see how much I did two 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.370
 kills with this little synthe reagan 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.750
 because good with me I did one that 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.680
 it would have been here see it's really not 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.050
 terrible so I wanted to show you 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.740
 my co so wait i showed he 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.680
 test a small speedtest like that where I 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.750
 add add capture playback 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.840
 screen windows screenshot i'll 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.479
 do not bother me 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.919
 how do we do that I do 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.080
 capturing windows at its best market 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:03.419
 tak tak and I do a same thing myself 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:09.599

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:13.669
 I put this for you but wait 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:18.210

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.790

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.190
 pro middle we are gone you will see 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.360
 it's going to be enough to say enough 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.860
 violent already you see the time that puts 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.290
 to find a server in saas and that's 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.730
 not bad but it's true that you're going 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.170
 see that between the ping and then the 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.520
 knowing that it's pine to the most 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.390
 close anyway huh it's 60 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.830
 milliseconds it's really towards the 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.790
 closer is where we give our 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.410
 as I told you you see that's it 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.980
 fluctuate not bad enough it's enough 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.210
 correct 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.340
 there is not much to say in fact 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.450
 on the court in download this is not the 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.520
 download the problem because the do not 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.660
 well here I have small peaks but some 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.430
 little downward peaks but it's not 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.660
 too much a problem since anyway I 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.950
 do not use the download a lot 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.410
 share to watch the videos of the stuff 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.270
 like that download melo movies 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.950
 claude here's where you already see it 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.120
 barely take off what's up when that's 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.320
 goes down little by little like that it's 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.120
 that he finds more he does jerks 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.920
 to go back then the coue not 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.140
 disgusting in upload the deer bosser 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.630
 that's what 500 kg maximum what 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.890
 but it's 500 kg it's okay but the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.570
 thing is that it makes jerks all 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.220
 time and not with that we can nothing 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.200
