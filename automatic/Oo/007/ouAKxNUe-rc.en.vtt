00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello my name is boris schneider 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.580
 johne I am product manager at 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.970
 microsoft for windows and today i have 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.090
 brought you the windows 8.1 update 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.349
 update again what should that be 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.179
 microsoft has listened and she the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 Customers have told us you have to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.449
 causes 1 a little bit more 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 especially if you are dealing with it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.050
 want to serve a mouse there is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.900
 a series of new features 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 I'll show them here on my pc 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 when i go to my start screen 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.150
 see then I see in the corners already 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.099
 two new things right here above 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 Two new buttons to buttons 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.820
 come with the one I can the pc 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.170
 now easily turn it on and off 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 if i do not turn off the one switch 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.969
 find 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 Of course this is possible with the finger 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.450
 not just with the mouse on the touch 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.149
 screen and next to it there is a magnifying glass 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 that starts the search function in windows 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 8.1 with which you can use both the internet and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 also browse the local files 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 can be very practical on the other 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 So I see two on the bottom left 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 new ups have been installed it happens 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.730
 even me that I'm a two new 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 Get more out of the windows store hole there 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.219
 are already far over now 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.600
 200,000 in it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.890
 and that I forget it and now 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960
 I get such a friendly 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 Reminder you still have something else 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.570
 have not tried it here in the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.400
 for example, human being annoyed you 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.200
 not that can try 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.640
 the other story we have on 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 changed home screen is one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.210
 easier to use with the mouse earlier 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.650
 I simulate that one with the finger 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 if I'm on the right here somewhere 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.150
 clicked then went downstairs 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 screen a bar on with commands 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.070
 and you would have now with the mouse 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.390
 can go there 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.250
 that will change now if I am now 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.290
 actually take the mouse and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 on the right side here are the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 corresponding commands automatically 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 the agency 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 that is windows 8 1 behaves here 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 more like the windows 7 I'm used to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 I'm so switching something 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.250
 easier is the other big one 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.380
 changes that arise as concerns concerns 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.119
 the desktop if I have a look at the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 desktop switch has the same look 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.750
 what happened 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 down here namely are image symbols too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 find of the apps that are currently running 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.020
 they were so in the left screen so far 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.670
 You can hide the frame 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.259
 now also show on the taskbar 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.210
 and for example if I have the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.829
 I can often blame myself too 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.850
 quite classic again to the taskbar 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.009
 to pin 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.810
 this is down here I can see 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.970
 also this preview picture here 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.770
 in media playback, I can too 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.450
 for example, forward and rewind without 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.700
 to start from that is called the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.220
 things just behave like me 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 that of windows 7 so far even know in 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.310
 In this respect, when I'm with the mouse 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 drive to the top of the screen 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.880
 is this black bar and there 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.530
 You can also see two classics here 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.510
 I shrink the app accordingly 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.090
 or completely close if I do not 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.580
 More need so the classic windows 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.709
 7 behave now also for the modern ones 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.849
 apps when i use a mouse with it 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.330
 Of course the change will be a lot 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.730
 easier 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.500
 and of course because the taskbar is like that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.420
 handy is when I go to the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.280
 home screen or if i am 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.900
 in a down in here too if 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.000
 I go to the bottom of the screen 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.010
 then the taskbar will appear so that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.959
 me also the change now for example 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.090
 here in my favorite excel or in 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.049
 my outlook just falls off I have to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.660
 no longer on the start screen 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.340
 back because with mouse down I the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.340
 get classic taskbar again 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.470
 all these innovations 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.360
 fully automatic to you windows 8 1 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.760
 update is automatically via windows 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.110
 update on your pc played if you like him 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.950
 For example , you see them in the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.210
 right upper corner 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.830
 if that already the magnifying glass symbol 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.720
 then appears on the home screen 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.580
 is that with them already if they 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.080
 in touch pc have like this one here 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.180
 then changes in the touch control 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.980
 nothing that concerns completely new things in the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.940
 essential mouse and keyboard with it 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.890
 it will be more comfortable 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.940
 in this sense a lot of fun with 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.940
 windows 8.1
