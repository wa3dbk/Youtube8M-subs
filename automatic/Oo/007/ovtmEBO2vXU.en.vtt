you<00:00:01.829> want<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.159> use<00:00:02.310> science<00:00:02.909> good<00:00:03.899> thanks

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.260

these industries and well you can't just

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.330 
these industries and well you can't just
dismiss<00:00:50.930> those<00:00:51.930> economic<00:00:52.590> concerns<00:00:53.040> as<00:00:53.309> well

I'm<00:03:13.220> sorry<00:03:13.519> what's<00:03:13.670> up<00:03:14.349> see

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.619 

so

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629

bubbles others magazine so the further

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.330 
bubbles others magazine so the further
strict<00:03:32.319> ethical<00:03:32.890> guidelines<00:03:33.269> around<00:03:35.340> how

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
strict ethical guidelines around how

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.280 
strict ethical guidelines around how
these<00:03:36.940> would<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.599> is<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> matter<00:03:38.140> of

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
these would be is this is the matter of

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.820 
these would be is this is the matter of
manufacturing<00:03:39.250> embryos<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.840> produce<00:03:41.410> sex

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
manufacturing embryos to to produce sex

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.970 
manufacturing embryos to to produce sex
so<00:03:41.980> much<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:43.330> know<00:03:43.420> these<00:03:43.630> are

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
so much this is you know these are

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.360 
so much this is you know these are
embryos<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.130> would<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.459> been<00:03:45.720> destroying

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
embryos that would have been destroying

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.309 
embryos that would have been destroying
now<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.790> turns<00:03:49.599> out<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.900> there<00:03:50.200> have<00:03:50.290> been

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
now it turns out that there have been

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.410 
now it turns out that there have been
some<00:03:50.620> planet<00:03:51.010> integrators<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.060> may<00:03:52.239> allow

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
some planet integrators that may allow

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.940 
some planet integrators that may allow
us<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:53.019> produce<00:03:53.260> stem<00:03:54.160> cell<00:03:54.430> lines<00:03:54.670> without

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
us to produce stem cell lines without

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.190 
us to produce stem cell lines without
the<00:03:56.950> use<00:03:57.129> of<00:03:57.160> those<00:03:57.489> memories<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.360> eating

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
the use of those memories and eating

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.009 
the use of those memories and eating
that's<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.530> case<00:03:59.709> that's<00:03:59.950> one<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.310> them<00:04:00.430> that

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
that's the case that's one of them that

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.710 
that's the case that's one of them that
removes<00:04:02.019> protection<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:04.000> until<00:04:04.810> those

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
removes protection but until those

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.960 
removes protection but until those
technologies<00:04:07.720> are<00:04:08.230> criminal<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.950> think<00:04:09.700> for<00:04:09.880> us

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
technologies are criminal I think for us

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.250 
technologies are criminal I think for us
to<00:04:10.180> say<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.720> would<00:04:10.900> deny<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
to say that we would deny the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.530 
to say that we would deny the
possibility<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:12.549> making<00:04:12.910> serious<00:04:13.510> progress

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
possibility of making serious progress

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.650 
possibility of making serious progress
on<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:15.280> billeting<00:04:15.849> diseases<00:04:16.510> like

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
on the billeting diseases like

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.180 
on the billeting diseases like
Parkinson's<00:04:17.200> or<00:04:18.070> Alzheimer's<00:04:18.329> or<00:04:19.329> or<00:04:20.019> two<00:04:20.950> now

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or or two now

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or or two now
diabetes<00:04:21.940> or<00:04:22.650> or<00:04:23.650> objects<00:04:24.250> disease<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.180> know

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
diabetes or or objects disease you know

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.840 
diabetes or or objects disease you know
the<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.690> notion<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.620> we<00:04:26.860> will<00:04:27.010> not<00:04:27.190> want<00:04:27.550> to

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
the the notion that we will not want to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.450 
the the notion that we will not want to
believe<00:04:28.360> someone<00:04:31.470> doesn't<00:04:32.470> make<00:04:32.590> sense<00:04:32.800> and

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
believe someone doesn't make sense and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.340 
believe someone doesn't make sense and
go<00:04:33.910> back<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.360> what<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.539> said<00:04:34.570> before<00:04:34.900> about<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
go back to what I said before about the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.719 
go back to what I said before about the
importance<00:04:35.950> of<00:04:36.010> science<00:04:36.600> yeah<00:04:37.600> why<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:38.729> think

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
importance of science yeah why I think

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.330 
importance of science yeah why I think
that<00:04:39.970> science<00:04:40.630> doesn't<00:04:41.320> solve<00:04:41.710> our<00:04:42.010> most

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
that science doesn't solve our most

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.840 
that science doesn't solve our most
important<00:04:42.850> crops<00:04:43.560> because<00:04:44.560> our<00:04:45.550> most

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
important crops because our most

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.120 
important crops because our most
important<00:04:46.389> problems<00:04:46.750> are<00:04:46.870> how<00:04:47.139> we<00:04:47.200> live

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
important problems are how we live

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.439 
important problems are how we live
together<00:04:48.340> now

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
together now

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.420 
together now
ourselves<00:04:50.199> each<00:04:50.469> other<00:04:50.710> that's<00:04:51.069> to<00:04:51.279> add<00:04:51.400> value

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
ourselves each other that's to add value

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.969 
ourselves each other that's to add value
so<00:04:52.059> that's<00:04:52.270> do<00:04:52.449> what<00:04:52.569> happens<00:04:52.960> that's<00:04:53.740> good

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
so that's do what happens that's good

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:09.290 
so that's do what happens that's good
for<00:04:54.099> out<00:04:54.400> and

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.279 

what<00:05:10.300> science<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.229> help<00:05:11.289> us<00:05:12.900> make<00:05:13.900> good

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
what science can help us make good

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.500 
what science can help us make good
decisions
