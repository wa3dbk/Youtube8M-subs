special tool to take this off but what

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.400 
special tool to take this off but what
I'm<00:00:18.869> using

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I'm using

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.120 
I'm using
I'm<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:22.160> pliers<00:00:23.210> -<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.960> take<00:00:25.170> off<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.590> all

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
I'm is a pliers - to take off on all

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.269 
I'm is a pliers - to take off on all
your<00:00:26.310> filters<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> pretty<00:00:28.920> much<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.189> I'm

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
your filters so pretty much what I'm

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.110 
your filters so pretty much what I'm
going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.730> grab<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:32.120> then

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
going to do is grab it right here then

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
going to do is grab it right here then
twist<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> once<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.239> twist<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.649> unlocks

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
twist so once you twist one it unlocks

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.630 
twist so once you twist one it unlocks
it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.209 
it
once<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> unlocks<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.649> pull<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> right

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
once you unlocks it you pull it right

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.549 
once you unlocks it you pull it right
off<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> lock<00:00:44.280> mechanism<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:45.120> guess

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
off so it has a lock mechanism I guess

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:59.510 
off so it has a lock mechanism I guess
when<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.649> twist<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:49.039> see<00:00:54.920> let's<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:58.520> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
when you twist it see let's see so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.230 
when you twist it see let's see so
pretty<00:00:59.789> much

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
pretty much

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.040 
pretty much
you<00:01:02.140> grab<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.680> turn<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.370> twist<00:01:03.880> it<00:01:04.150> locks

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
you grab it and turn it twist it locks

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.410 
you grab it and turn it twist it locks
into<00:01:05.260> place

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
into place

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:20.990 
into place
so<00:01:07.420> if<00:01:07.570> there's<00:01:07.810> lots<00:01:08.140> there's<00:01:08.920> open<00:01:19.200> enter

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
so if there's lots there's open enter

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.360 
so if there's lots there's open enter
left<00:01:22.000> open<00:01:22.480> lock<00:01:23.200> open<00:01:24.120> so<00:01:25.980> when<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.070> put<00:01:27.250> this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
left open lock open so when you put this

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:47.910 
left open lock open so when you put this
back<00:01:27.580> on<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.900> put<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.200> back<00:01:47.440> on

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
back on when you put this back on

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.330 
back on when you put this back on
