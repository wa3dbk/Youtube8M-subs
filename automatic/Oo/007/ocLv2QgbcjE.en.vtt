00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
talk to you today about coated bearings

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.580 
talk to you today about coated bearings
now<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.330> not<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.870> budgets<00:00:13.290> really

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
now it's not that my budgets really

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.079 
now it's not that my budgets really
tight<00:00:13.860> cuz<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.219> see<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:14.519> only<00:00:14.670> got<00:00:14.880> two

of<00:00:17.340> year<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> spend<00:00:18.000> more<00:00:18.150> time<00:00:18.210> at<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
of year I spend more time at the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420 
of year I spend more time at the
racetrack<00:00:18.869> than<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> office<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.340> I

racetrack than I do in the office and I
didn't<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> good<00:00:21.000> job<00:00:21.060> gathering<00:00:21.750> up<00:00:21.840> lots

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
didn't do a good job gathering up lots

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
didn't do a good job gathering up lots
of<00:00:22.230> coded<00:00:22.650> samples<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.850> let<00:00:24.000> me<00:00:24.060> talk<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> you

of coded samples but let me talk to you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.870 
of coded samples but let me talk to you
about<00:00:24.660> coded<00:00:25.199> bearings<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.279> last<00:00:26.519> 10

about coded bearings in the last 10
years<00:00:27.240> we've<00:00:27.930> seen<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.320> coated<00:00:28.740> bearing

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

years we've seen are coated bearing
sales<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.939> skyrocket<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.560> used<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> be

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
sales just skyrocket you know used to be

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
sales just skyrocket you know used to be
a<00:00:32.070> little<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> our<00:00:32.700> race<00:00:32.880> bearing<00:00:33.329> sales

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a little bit of our race bearing sales

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
a little bit of our race bearing sales
was<00:00:33.870> coated<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> bet<00:00:35.430> thirty<00:00:35.730> maybe

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
was coated and now I bet thirty maybe

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.389 
was coated and now I bet thirty maybe
forty<00:00:36.180> percent<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.079> coated<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.680> doesn't

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
forty percent is coated and that doesn't

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
forty percent is coated and that doesn't
count<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.760> course<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.180> our<00:00:39.329> customers<00:00:39.870> buy

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
count of course what our customers buy

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
count of course what our customers buy
from<00:00:40.320> us<00:00:40.469> uncoated<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.399> sent<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
from us uncoated and then sent out to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
from us uncoated and then sent out to
their<00:00:42.239> favorite<00:00:42.450> coder<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.770> number<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
their favorite coder so a number of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
their favorite coder so a number of
reasons<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.059> coated<00:00:45.570> bearings<00:00:45.960> first<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
reasons for coated bearings first one is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
reasons for coated bearings first one is
that<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> coatings<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.390> most<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.809> today's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that the coatings and most of today's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.939 
that the coatings and most of today's
coatings<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.629> PTFE<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
coatings are a PTFE you know that is the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.430 
coatings are a PTFE you know that is the
the<00:00:53.640> common<00:00:54.059> name<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.300> Teflon<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the common name for Teflon which is a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.610 
the common name for Teflon which is a
trade<00:00:55.770> name<00:00:55.800> PTFE<00:00:56.789> based<00:00:57.090> coatings<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> they

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
trade name PTFE based coatings and they

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.430 
trade name PTFE based coatings and they
tend<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.160> fairly<00:00:59.520> tough<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.750> also<00:01:01.020> tend

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
tend to be fairly tough they also tend

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920 
tend to be fairly tough they also tend
to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.590> slippery<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:03.000> reduce<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.719> wear

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to be slippery and they reduce the wear

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.539 
to be slippery and they reduce the wear
reduce<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> friction<00:01:04.949> between<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
reduce the friction between the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.940 
reduce the friction between the
crankshaft<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> bearing<00:01:06.960> another<00:01:07.770> good

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
crankshaft and the bearing another good

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.640 
crankshaft and the bearing another good
thing<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.220> coatings<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.140> because

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
thing about coatings is that because

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
thing about coatings is that because
they're<00:01:10.920> slippery<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> marginal

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
they're slippery if we have a marginal

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
they're slippery if we have a marginal
oil<00:01:13.049> film<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.590> talked<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.340> last<00:01:14.400> time

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
oil film we talked about that last time

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.270 
oil film we talked about that last time
in<00:01:15.119> part<00:01:15.360> two<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.780> series<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
in part two of this series if we have a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
in part two of this series if we have a
marginal<00:01:17.880> oil<00:01:18.150> film<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.170> less<00:01:19.409> likely<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
marginal oil film this is less likely to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
marginal oil film this is less likely to
seize<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> crankshaft<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.299> coating<00:01:21.720> is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
seize to the crankshaft the coating is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.920 
seize to the crankshaft the coating is
then<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.740> soft<00:01:23.009> Babbitt<00:01:23.549> overlay<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
then the soft Babbitt overlay here so

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
then the soft Babbitt overlay here so
that's<00:01:25.110> another<00:01:25.409> reason<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.920> coated<00:01:26.460> berries

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that's another reason for coated berries

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
that's another reason for coated berries
a<00:01:27.090> third<00:01:27.810> reason<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.530> matter<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> fact<00:01:29.310> let<00:01:29.490> me

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a third reason is matter of fact let me

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
a third reason is matter of fact let me
show<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.119> sample<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.860> sample

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
show you this sample here in this sample

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
show you this sample here in this sample
bearing<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.600> Alcohol<00:01:37.229> dragster

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
bearing this is from a Alcohol dragster

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.990 
bearing this is from a Alcohol dragster
and<00:01:37.860> you'll<00:01:38.040> notice<00:01:38.189> there's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> big<00:01:38.700> hole<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and you'll notice there's a big hole in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.399 
and you'll notice there's a big hole in
the<00:01:39.270> middle<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> bearing<00:01:40.079> where<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the middle of the bearing where the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.800 
the middle of the bearing where the
overlay<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> that's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.329> phenomena

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
overlay is going and that's a phenomena

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.819 
overlay is going and that's a phenomena
called<00:01:42.960> cavitation

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
called cavitation

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.359 
called cavitation
and<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:45.119> coated<00:01:46.079> bearing<00:01:46.439> helps<00:01:46.799> reduce<00:01:47.159> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and a coated bearing helps reduce that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
and a coated bearing helps reduce that
cavitation<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> surface<00:01:49.200> strength

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
cavitation because the surface strength

it<00:01:53.820> tends<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> reduce<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.810> tendency<00:01:55.259> to

it tends to reduce that tendency to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.069 
it tends to reduce that tendency to
start<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> cavitation<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.329> number<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
gone from a performance part to an OE

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.100 
gone from a performance part to an OE
part<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.640> we'll<00:03:34.150> come<00:03:34.360> back<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.750> complete

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
part and we'll come back and complete

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.080 
part and we'll come back and complete
that<00:03:35.320> circle<00:03:35.769> sometime<00:03:36.250> soon<00:03:36.519> when<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:36.790> bring

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
that circle sometime soon when we bring

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.630 
that circle sometime soon when we bring
OE<00:03:37.299> technology<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.380> materials<00:03:38.890> into<00:03:39.430> some

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
OE technology and materials into some

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.769 
OE technology and materials into some
new<00:03:39.760> coatings<00:03:40.180> thanks<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.290> tuning<00:03:41.440> in
