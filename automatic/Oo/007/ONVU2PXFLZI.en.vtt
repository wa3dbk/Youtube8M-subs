boxes<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.320> see<00:00:52.469> how<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> works

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.869 

I'm<00:00:59.730> good<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:01.680> things<00:01:02.010> first<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
I'm good so first things first the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.859 
I'm good so first things first the
printer<00:01:03.329> itself<00:01:04.970> that's<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> guy<00:01:06.420> right

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
there so the first thing that really

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
there so the first thing that really
strikes<00:01:11.010> me<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.180> small

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
strikes me about this is that it's small

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
and tried to connect my phone which has

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.960 
and tried to connect my phone which has
the<00:03:33.570> app<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> printer<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:35.280> took<00:03:35.940> a

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the app on it to the printer it took a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.510 
the app on it to the printer it took a
few<00:03:36.180> tries<00:03:36.240> until<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.440> would<00:03:37.830> actually

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
few tries until it would actually

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520 
few tries until it would actually
connect<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.660> kept<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.930> out<00:03:40.230> and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
connect I just kept going out and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.890 
connect I just kept going out and
reconnecting<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.640> eventually<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.630> did

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
reconnecting and eventually it did

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.570 
reconnecting and eventually it did
connect<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:43.980> asked<00:03:44.250> me<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.550> a

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
connect and then it asked me for a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.990 
connect and then it asked me for a
password

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
password

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.970 
password
and<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.020> went<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.380> read<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.620> instructions

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
and so I went and read the instructions

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.610 
and so I went and read the instructions
and<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.970> password<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.320> put<00:03:49.500> in

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
and the password that you have to put in

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.190 
and the password that you have to put in
is<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.910> factory<00:03:50.910> default<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.450> one<00:03:51.720> one<00:03:51.960> one

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
is the factory default of one one one

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.610 
is the factory default of one one one
one

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
one

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.020 
one
so<00:03:52.770> if<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.950> get<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.220> password<00:03:53.760> page

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
so if you get to that password page

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.510 
so if you get to that password page
that's<00:03:54.750> what<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.990> got<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.260> do<00:03:55.380> then<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.400> can

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
that's what you got to do then you can

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.610 
that's what you got to do then you can
change<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.910> whatever<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.360> want<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.350> I'm

it's<00:05:11.970> instant<00:05:12.450> film<00:05:12.660> you've<00:05:13.080> gotta<00:05:13.290> wait<00:05:13.530> a

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
it's instant film you've gotta wait a

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.130 
it's instant film you've gotta wait a
little<00:05:13.800> bit<00:05:14.040> until<00:05:14.760> it<00:05:15.330> develops<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.780> I

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
little bit until it develops so I

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.140 
little bit until it develops so I
believe<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.590> takes<00:05:19.680> about<00:05:20.870> 16<00:05:21.870> seconds<00:05:23.150> tests

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
believe it takes about 16 seconds tests

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.540 
believe it takes about 16 seconds tests
have<00:05:24.240> shown<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.480> little<00:05:24.720> bit<00:05:24.960> longer<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:26.400> it's

up as it goes that's pretty fun that's
pretty<00:05:47.009> exciting<00:05:47.419> so<00:05:48.419> that's<00:05:48.600> it<00:05:48.750> that's<00:05:48.930> what

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
pretty exciting so that's it that's what

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.290 
pretty exciting so that's it that's what

your tablet and get an instant print and
this<00:05:54.900> kind<00:05:55.139> of<00:05:55.199> does<00:05:55.380> exactly<00:05:55.680> what<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:55.949> was

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
this kind of does exactly what I was

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.100 
this kind of does exactly what I was
hoping<00:05:56.130> it<00:05:56.550> would<00:05:56.669> do<00:05:56.820> was<00:05:57.539> a<00:05:57.570> little<00:05:57.870> finicky

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
hoping it would do was a little finicky

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.930 
hoping it would do was a little finicky
to<00:05:58.289> get<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.770> connect<00:05:59.039> but<00:05:59.220> once<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.550> did<00:05:59.789> get

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
to get it to connect but once I did get

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.580 
to get it to connect but once I did get
it<00:06:00.090> to<00:06:00.240> connect<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.780> seemed<00:06:01.020> like<00:06:01.199> it<00:06:01.410> was

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
it to connect it seemed like it was

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.170 
it to connect it seemed like it was
really<00:06:01.949> straightforward<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.610> get<00:06:02.789> the<00:06:02.910> prints

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
really straightforward to get the prints

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.260 
really straightforward to get the prints
going<00:06:03.900> making<00:06:04.620> adjustments<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:06.060> best
