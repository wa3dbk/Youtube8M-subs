00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
up push a button it is a whole lot

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.199 
up push a button it is a whole lot
easier<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.910> other<00:03:51.150> than<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:52.100> this<00:03:53.100> truck<00:03:53.430> is

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
easier the other than that this truck is

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.960 
easier the other than that this truck is
very<00:03:54.360> comfortable<00:03:55.220> great<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.489> tooling

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
very comfortable great for tooling

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.509 
very comfortable great for tooling
around<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> city<00:03:57.900> or<00:03:58.170> in<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.220> middle<00:03:59.430> of

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
the woods either way because of its

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.259 
the woods either way because of its
smaller<00:04:01.890> size<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.610> actually<00:04:02.760> think<00:04:03.060> it's

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
smaller size I actually think it's

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.020 
smaller size I actually think it's
better<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:04.019> instances<00:04:04.500> instances

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
better in some instances instances

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.910 
better in some instances instances
off-road<00:04:06.030> because<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.660> can<00:04:06.810> take<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.019> pretty

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
off-road because you can take it pretty

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.190 
off-road because you can take it pretty
much<00:04:08.130> anywhere<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.530> it'll<00:04:10.530> go<00:04:10.650> there

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.440
