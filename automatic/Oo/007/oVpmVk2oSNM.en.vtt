00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.269
 but one 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.210
 so hide a hundred years ago 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.980
 a historical picture buying the encounter of two 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.930
 Towers and gates of old age and already a train station 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 a new symbol of world connectedness 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
 all 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.040
 a terminus station 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.980
 if you extended to the transit station two decades later 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.830
 which became the railway junction 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.210
 but who already guessed the stormy development of traffic at that time 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.280
 ahead of our century 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.350
 this peaked in the 1940s 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.360
 who just warned a dialogue product 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 it smoked and fished at the stress test 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 but the romantic time of the steam locomotive was over 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.590
 what remained 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 the old train station 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.610
 the Berlin Central Station 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.190
 the station of the federal city 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.920
 originated in a time 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.290
 As you say the world was still fine 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.240
 Aim of the actions of travelers 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.170
 the old train station served 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.680
 Millions of people left arriving waiting for their connection 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.299
 just out
