still because the concept is the thing
and<00:00:19.310> those<00:00:19.610> numbers<00:00:19.820> do<00:00:20.119> change<00:00:20.450> every<00:00:20.720> few

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
and those numbers do change every few

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.530 
and those numbers do change every few
years<00:00:21.020> we<00:00:21.230> try<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.470> get<00:00:21.650> them<00:00:21.800> right<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:23.300> never

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
years we try to get them right and never

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.750 
sure over the Cure do you think this is
50,000<00:00:38.719> could<00:00:39.320> be<00:00:39.500> pretty<00:00:40.190> close<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.429> the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
50,000 could be pretty close to the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:52.299 
50,000 could be pretty close to the
proper<00:00:41.390> number<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:49.929> could<00:00:50.929> be<00:00:51.140> really<00:00:51.890> precise

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
proper number it could be really precise

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.450 
proper number it could be really precise
estimate<00:00:52.940> Wow<00:00:53.530> well<00:00:54.530> we'll<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:54.920> an<00:00:55.039> inventory
