weekly and monthly right beside it now

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
weekly and monthly right beside it now
it's<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.760> interesting<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's pretty interesting is that if you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's pretty interesting is that if you
guys<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.500> while<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.400> had<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
guys know a while back they had the the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.000 
guys know a while back they had the the
idea<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:11.060> what's<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> called<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.710> prestige<00:01:13.710> up

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
idea of what's it called a prestige up

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
idea of what's it called a prestige up
this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.460> where<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:14.790> would<00:01:14.909> assume<00:01:15.060> prestige

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this is where i would assume prestige

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
this is where i would assume prestige
probably<00:01:16.259> would<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.560> went<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.009> day<00:01:17.299> if<00:01:18.299> they

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
probably would have went one day if they

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
probably would have went one day if they
ever<00:01:18.659> decided<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.619> work<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
ever decided you know work on it you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.490 
ever decided you know work on it you
know<00:01:21.330> i<00:01:21.360> would<00:01:21.450> assume<00:01:21.600> i<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> come<00:01:22.380> out

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
know i would assume i got you come out

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
know i would assume i got you come out
someday<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:23.640> where<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> tab<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
someday it is probably where the tab it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
someday it is probably where the tab it
would<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.500> obviously<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:25.979> really

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
would be so obviously it's not really

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
would be so obviously it's not really
taking<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.790> priority<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> all-time<00:01:28.200> one

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
taking the priority of the all-time one

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
taking the priority of the all-time one
when<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> high<00:01:29.460> scores

that is really unfair about this is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.069 
that is really unfair about this is
obviously<00:01:53.610> people<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> bonus

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079

experience<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.710> stats<00:01:56.009> either<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.180> from

doing the minigames or from the
promotion<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.520> don't<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:00.570> Jax<00:02:00.930> has<00:02:01.409> added

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

that<00:02:02.130> into<00:02:02.520> into<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> can't<00:02:03.930> really

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
obvious but I do love this addition to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.320 
obvious but I do love this addition to
the<00:03:31.590> high<00:03:31.739> score<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.280> very<00:03:32.340> nice<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.850> think

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330

I'm<00:03:33.420> still<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.870> use<00:03:33.989> ruin<00:03:34.290> tracker<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.979 
I'm still going to use ruin tracker I
just<00:03:35.730> because<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.120> don't<00:03:36.299> like<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> fact<00:03:36.840> that

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
just because I don't like the fact that

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.870 
just because I don't like the fact that
it<00:03:37.230> starts<00:03:37.650> sobbing<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.519> guys<00:03:38.640> want

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.090 
it starts sobbing like if you guys want
to<00:03:38.940> set<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> weekly<00:03:39.870> record<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.920> wait

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
to set a weekly record you have to wait

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.460 
to set a weekly record you have to wait
till<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.340> week<00:03:41.489> starts<00:03:41.940> basically<00:03:42.450> um<00:03:42.630> I

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
till the week starts basically um I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.590 
till the week starts basically um I
guess<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.010> one<00:03:44.220> kind<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:45.030> think<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.420> just

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
guess this one kind of I think I just

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.270 
guess this one kind of I think I just
started<00:03:45.870> today<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.140> think<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.530> way<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> few

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
started today I think it's way for a few

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.740 
started today I think it's way for a few
days<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.700> was<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.000> says<00:03:48.150> it's<00:03:48.329> ending<00:03:48.660> in

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
days it was like it says it's ending in

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.500 
days it was like it says it's ending in
one<00:03:48.930> day<00:03:49.140> in<00:03:49.200> five<00:03:49.500> hours<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.880> I'm<00:03:50.940> guessing<00:03:51.150> is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
one day in five hours so I'm guessing is

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.590 
one day in five hours so I'm guessing is
our<00:03:52.019> first<00:03:52.320> one<00:03:52.530> might<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.890> be<00:03:53.040> too<00:03:53.250> long<00:03:53.600> yeah

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
our first one might not be too long yeah

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.560 
our first one might not be too long yeah

work on me internet no oh you better not
reducing<00:04:59.440> ok<00:05:00.039> there<00:05:00.190> we<00:05:00.280> go<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.610> select<00:05:01.030> month

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
reducing ok there we go so select month

reducing ok there we go so select month
like<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.750> guess<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:02.020> have<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.169> select<00:05:02.349> a<00:05:02.530> month

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
like I guess you have to select a month

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.560 
like I guess you have to select a month
then<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.039> can<00:05:03.160> select<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.520> week<00:05:03.729> process<00:05:04.090> like

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
then you can select a week process like

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.570 
then you can select a week process like
a<00:05:04.599> week<00:05:04.810> ok<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:05.889> that's<00:05:06.039> kind<00:05:06.220> of<00:05:06.250> cool<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.430> can

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
a week ok so that's kind of cool you can

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.430 
a week ok so that's kind of cool you can
also<00:05:06.699> see<00:05:06.970> like<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.210> history<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.690> guess<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:08.139> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
also see like the history I guess of the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.920 
also see like the history I guess of the
months<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.220> 1mon<00:05:09.759> someone<00:05:10.090> does<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.300> crazy-ass

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
months so 1mon someone does a crazy-ass

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.290 
months so 1mon someone does a crazy-ass
amount<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.410> experience<00:05:11.940> it'll<00:05:12.940> basically<00:05:13.090> be

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
amount of experience it'll basically be

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.969 
amount of experience it'll basically be
in<00:05:13.630> there<00:05:13.990> forever<00:05:14.199> I<00:05:14.470> guess<00:05:14.620> it'll<00:05:14.800> become

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
in there forever I guess it'll become

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.310 
in there forever I guess it'll become
like<00:05:15.280> not<00:05:15.669> recorded<00:05:16.270> but<00:05:16.389> you'll<00:05:17.080> see<00:05:17.199> the

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
like not recorded but you'll see the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.350 
like not recorded but you'll see the
numbers<00:05:17.590> there<00:05:17.620> forever<00:05:18.159> so<00:05:18.940> that's<00:05:19.090> kind<00:05:19.330> of

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
numbers there forever so that's kind of

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.210 
numbers there forever so that's kind of
cool<00:05:19.570> maybe<00:05:19.750> one<00:05:20.050> month<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.470> will<00:05:20.530> go<00:05:20.830> for<00:05:21.070> like

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
cool maybe one month I will go for like

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.969 
cool maybe one month I will go for like
ranked<00:05:21.490> 14<00:05:21.880> monthly<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:23.560> kind<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.800> hard

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
ranked 14 monthly but it's kind of hard

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.260 
ranked 14 monthly but it's kind of hard
to<00:05:24.009> do<00:05:24.190> whenever<00:05:24.430> there's<00:05:24.699> you<00:05:24.849> know<00:05:24.909> like<00:05:25.120> it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
to do whenever there's you know like it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.520 
to do whenever there's you know like it

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
should I could do and maybe some

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.249 
should I could do and maybe some
fletching<00:05:33.009> or<00:05:33.130> mage<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:33.810> besides<00:05:34.810> I<00:05:34.990> don't<00:05:35.050> I

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
fletching or mage but besides I don't I

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.230 
fletching or mage but besides I don't I
could<00:05:35.440> ever<00:05:35.560> really<00:05:35.680> get<00:05:35.889> a<00:05:35.919> monthly<00:05:36.310> too<00:05:37.060> much

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
could ever really get a monthly too much

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.360 
could ever really get a monthly too much
from<00:05:37.389> now<00:05:37.539> because<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:37.930> have<00:05:38.199> not<00:05:38.830> too<00:05:38.979> many<00:05:39.009> fat

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
from now because I have not too many fat

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.980 
from now because I have not too many fat
skills<00:05:39.669> left<00:05:39.909> I<00:05:40.000> guess<00:05:40.210> well<00:05:40.389> yes<00:05:40.509> some<00:05:40.750> but

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
skills left I guess well yes some but

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.480 
skills left I guess well yes some but
not<00:05:41.080> that<00:05:41.259> many<00:05:41.440> compared<00:05:41.889> to<00:05:42.009> other<00:05:42.159> people

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
not that many compared to other people

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.339 
not that many compared to other people
have<00:05:42.669> like<00:05:42.849> summoning<00:05:43.690> they<00:05:43.810> can<00:05:43.960> still<00:05:44.199> do

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
have like summoning they can still do

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.350 
have like summoning they can still do
and<00:05:44.650> but<00:05:44.889> I<00:05:45.400> guess<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.610> can<00:05:45.969> go<00:05:46.120> for<00:05:46.300> the

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
and but I guess you can go for the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.749 
and but I guess you can go for the
individual<00:05:46.960> stats<00:05:47.349> by<00:05:47.650> itself<00:05:48.099> like<00:05:48.490> weekly

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
individual stats by itself like weekly

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.430 
individual stats by itself like weekly
you<00:05:49.060> can<00:05:49.210> probably<00:05:49.479> go<00:05:49.539> for<00:05:49.690> prayer<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.289> like

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
probably rank one something like that a

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.339 
probably rank one something like that a
pretty<00:05:54.909> cool<00:05:55.120> new<00:05:55.240> addition<00:05:55.630> like<00:05:55.719> I<00:05:55.840> said<00:05:56.110> I

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349
