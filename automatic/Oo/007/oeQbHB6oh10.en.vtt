00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.990
A Des Moines man, charged

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.850
with animal torture, is now

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.660
free. Charles Urbach posted a

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.620
200- dollar bond after spending

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.690
several hours in jail.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.500
A witness of the torture says

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.460
that's far too little punishment

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.960
for such a twisted crime. Shaina

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.330
Humphries reports.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.700
&lt;I started shaking, I was

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.640
furious. I wanted to do

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.440
something

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.010
but I was on another balcony,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.640
there wasn't much I could do

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
other than call the police.&gt; SO

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.680
THAT'S WHAT BRITTANI ROBBINS DID

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.610
EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. WHEN

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.220
OFFICERS ARRIVED, THEY TOO

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.720
WITNESSED THIS MAN CHARLES

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.790
URBACH, TAKE THE ABUSE TO THE

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.950
NEXT LEVEL.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.590
&lt;we witnessed him pouring

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.490
water, what looked like off the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.090
balcony.&gt;

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.090
&lt;the water he was dumping, was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.260
actually on to the dog. And it

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.330
was like 23 degrees outside.&gt;

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.300
URBACH REFUSED TO LET THE

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.930
OFFICERS INSIDE, SO THEY HAD A

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.070
BUILDING MANAGER OPEN THE DOOR.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.340
POLICE SAY HE WAS HOLDING THE

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.970
WET DOG, DENYING THE CRUELTY..

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.070
BUT EVENTUALLY CONFESSED, AND

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.870
WAS ARRESTED.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.870
&lt;They said it was because the

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.970
dog made an accident on the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.540
floor, so that's why he beat

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.140
him.&gt;

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.210
&lt;She had a bird's eye view of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.550
what was happening on her

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.680
neighbor's balcony. We went and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.980
knocked on the door of that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.150
apartment, and the woman who

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.350
lives there says it's HER dog,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.520
and she was just as shocked as

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.790
everyone else, to find out what

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.090
happened there.&gt; DJ IS THE DOG'S

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.360
NAME. AND DJ'S OWNER, IS

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.090
URBACH'S GIRLFRIEND. SHE DIDN'T

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.690
WANT TO BE ON CAMERA, BUT SAID

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.030
SHE WASN'T HOME WHEN THIS ALL

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.530
HAPPENED, AND SHES EVER SEEN

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.100
URBACH HARM DJ BEFORE.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.330
&lt;I certainly understand the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.500
idea of frustration with an

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.470
animal, especially when they

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.440
make messes in the house. But

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.310
Animals do that sometimes If

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.440
you're not prepared to be able

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.140
to deal with that, then you

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.710
probably shouldn't be around

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.150
animals in the first place.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.550
ROBBINS AGREES. SHE SAYS SHE

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.280
HOPES URBACH IS NEVER LET NEAR

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.450
THE DOG AGAIN.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.880
&lt;If he's willing to do that to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.490
a dog, who know what else he's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.090
capable of?&gt; CONCERNED ABOUT

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.950
URBACH'S MENTAL STATE, SHE SAYS

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.320
SHE'S SPEAKING OUT ANYWAYS, IN

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.190
HOPES THAT AWARENESS OF LAX LAWS

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.860
... WILL LEAD TO STRICTER

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.560
PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO HURT

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.960
HELPLESS ANIMALS.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.600
&lt;Hopefully they'll make the law

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.000
more serious with higher fines,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.470
longer jail time, not a $200

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.640
bond.&gt; IN DM, SHAINA HUMPHRIES,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.110
KCCI

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.110
Local activist, Lin Sorensen,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.210
with the St. Francis Foundation

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.810
for Pets says there is an

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.320
epidemic of animal cruelty in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.680
our area--with 5 cases in the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.290
last 4 weeks.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.320
She says 48 states in the U.S.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.720
have stricter laws against

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.860
animal cruelty.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.740
Activists say animal torture
