00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 and then guillaume guys here too one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
 video for you and in today's video I 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.939
 wanted to discuss a subject because it has 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.680
 a lot of people who told me 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.740
 in comments that can not play 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.410
 well the maximum you take is vant that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.099
 Anyway, it's not as good as Fred and before. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.980
 from you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 these quoted and quoted complaints you have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.020
 who understand something that for you 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 playing well has to process information 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.360
 that the screen and the sound of the game I give you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.430
 so what is this information is a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.790
 mini map is the positioning of your 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.240
 friends the sound of the shots source steps the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.670
 sound of several other things is everything 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.960
 tags all you can imagine is a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 information for you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 so we had a new person 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 never revealed a control or knew that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.550
 There was a safe in you in her life. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 we think it will not process nor 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.900
 20% or 10% of the screen information of the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.149
 game 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 I for example I think the process 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.120
 average of 60 to 70 percent if it is not - 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 screen information and sound so 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.500
 what happens the more information you 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.290
 sue you better will be a game 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.360
 theoretically it is then if you 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.690
 thus percent of the information 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.659
 I would never die, I would never do without 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.750
 that I'm at the start and finally then 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.670
 I do not think anyone in the world to process 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 100% of the information an action that must 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 have 90 80 of those people who say 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.040
 who do absurd flex play 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.650
 exceptionally well then, if you 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.850
 wants to improve the processing of 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.130
 your information 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.950
 Look what you can do is play video 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.659
 tips see other people playing 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.150
 which are thought to process more 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.159
 information you play and watch 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.590
 gringo gameplay that plays like hell 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.380
 get there 90 thousand mottola 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.549
 although it has passed mw3 but anyway 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.560
 not doing this you will succeed 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.690
 increase the processing of information 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.820
 yours 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.470
 shall we say okay and then will be able to 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.060
 a better match then when you 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.740
 can watch in play pay attention 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.170
 what does a person do to kill a 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.140
 enemy she hides is a drop 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.920
 shots she jumps at last there's the hint to 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.940
 you're 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.730
 so this is what I hope you liked 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.130
 remembering that a lottery is going on 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.500
 channel will have in the description so it's super 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.940
 simple to participate there was okay then 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.280
 I hope you liked it if you liked it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.020
 the one taking that favorite spoke up 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.020
 near river
