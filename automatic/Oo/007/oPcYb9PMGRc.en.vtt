00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.310

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.400

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.810
 how to see its elements here as it has 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 meaning right now it is very heavy 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.290
 training but if it serves to turn 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.030
 then you have to work it right now 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.770
