absolutely true when I say that I was

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.499

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
doing a TV job in Sweden when I first

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.930 
doing a TV job in Sweden when I first
saw<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.810> very<00:02:09.020> first<00:02:09.289> iron<00:02:09.590> man<00:02:09.619> uh-huh<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.819> I

saw the very first iron man uh-huh and I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.280 
saw the very first iron man uh-huh and I
thought<00:02:11.090> I'd<00:02:11.240> never<00:02:11.330> be<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.080> time<00:02:12.260> I

thought I'd never be out at the time I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.050 
thought I'd never be out at the time I
just<00:02:12.650> done<00:02:12.800> lots<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.100> British<00:02:13.520> theater<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.030> I

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
just done lots of British theater and I

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.309 
just done lots of British theater and I
thought<00:02:14.210> I'd<00:02:14.330> never<00:02:14.510> get<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.750> make<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:14.990> movie

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
thought I'd never get to make a movie

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.260 
thought I'd never get to make a movie
like<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:16.010> there's<00:02:16.850> something<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.150> be

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
like that and there's something to be

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.390 
like that and there's something to be
allowed<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.480> be<00:02:17.690> part<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> Marvel

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
allowed to be part of the Marvel

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.280 
allowed to be part of the Marvel
Cinematic<00:02:19.400> Universe<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:22.959> it's<00:02:23.959> such<00:02:24.260> a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
Cinematic Universe and and it's such a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.820 
Cinematic Universe and and it's such a
privilege

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
privilege

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.150 
privilege
and<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.940> do<00:02:26.360> feel<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.720> Clark<00:02:27.620> Gregg<00:02:27.890> as

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.310 
back
well<00:04:16.640> he<00:04:16.730> said<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.030> know<00:04:17.450> I've<00:04:17.750> committed<00:04:18.200> to

well he said I know I've committed to
Thor<00:04:18.500> -<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:19.190> then<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.030> think<00:04:21.040> he<00:04:22.270> he

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
Thor - and then so I think he he

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.000 
Thor - and then so I think he he
probably<00:04:23.540> gets<00:04:25.870> he<00:04:26.870> probably<00:04:27.169> gets<00:04:27.410> severely

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
probably gets he probably gets severely

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.429 
probably gets he probably gets severely
chastised<00:04:28.760> by<00:04:29.240> Odin

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:30.439 
chastised by Odin

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.989 
chastised by Odin
so<00:04:31.239> he<00:04:32.239> gets<00:04:32.389> a<00:04:32.569> bit<00:04:32.929> of<00:04:33.019> a<00:04:33.080> hiding<00:04:33.789> from<00:04:34.789> his

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:34.999 
so he gets a bit of a hiding from his

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.919 
so he gets a bit of a hiding from his
dad<00:04:35.589> but<00:04:36.589> I<00:04:36.619> think<00:04:37.099> I<00:04:37.399> hope<00:04:38.149> and<00:04:38.419> I<00:04:38.479> said<00:04:38.779> this

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:38.929 
dad but I think I hope and I said this

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:41.559 
dad but I think I hope and I said this
having<00:04:39.050> not<00:04:39.379> seen<00:04:39.589> a<00:04:39.649> script<00:04:39.979> at<00:04:40.279> all<00:04:40.569> that

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
having not seen a script at all that

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.239 
having not seen a script at all that
there<00:04:41.839> is<00:04:42.050> room<00:04:42.559> for<00:04:44.349> redemption<00:04:45.349> for<00:04:45.979> him<00:04:46.129> in

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:46.249 
there is room for redemption for him in

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.279 
there is room for redemption for him in
a<00:04:46.339> way<00:04:46.459> like<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.879> hope<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.599> even<00:04:47.719> in<00:04:47.959> this<00:04:48.080> film

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
a way like I hope that even in this film

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.469 
a way like I hope that even in this film
despite<00:04:48.589> his<00:04:49.009> is<00:04:49.580> hatefulness

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
despite his is hatefulness

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.540 
despite his is hatefulness
and<00:04:50.989> I<00:04:51.080> think<00:04:51.289> people<00:04:51.589> do<00:04:51.709> really<00:04:51.949> hate<00:04:52.189> lucky

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
and I think people do really hate lucky

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.879 
and I think people do really hate lucky
by<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.729> end<00:04:54.339> there<00:04:55.339> is<00:04:55.550> still<00:04:55.879> a<00:04:55.909> glimmer<00:04:56.209> of

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
by the end there is still a glimmer of

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.059 
by the end there is still a glimmer of
redemption

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
redemption

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.879 
redemption
that's<00:04:58.459> like<00:04:58.969> before<00:04:59.659> can<00:04:59.959> see<00:05:00.169> Thor<00:05:00.559> can<00:05:00.709> see

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
that's like before can see Thor can see

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.619 
that's like before can see Thor can see
that<00:05:01.069> there's<00:05:01.279> this<00:05:01.429> this<00:05:02.059> vulnerable

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
that there's this this vulnerable

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.569 
that there's this this vulnerable
brother<00:05:02.899> he<00:05:03.259> almost<00:05:03.649> turned<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:04.099> around<00:05:04.159> yeah

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:04.579 
brother he almost turned you around yeah

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.209 
brother he almost turned you around yeah
yeah<00:05:05.300> yeah<00:05:05.809> so<00:05:06.169> maybe<00:05:06.409> in<00:05:06.589> Thor<00:05:06.800> 2<00:05:06.949> that'll

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
yeah yeah so maybe in Thor 2 that'll

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:08.439 
yeah yeah so maybe in Thor 2 that'll
happen<00:05:07.309> maybe<00:05:07.610> not<00:05:07.849> maybe<00:05:08.029> you'll<00:05:08.179> have<00:05:08.300> to

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
happen maybe not maybe you'll have to

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.649 
happen maybe not maybe you'll have to
wait<00:05:08.569> until<00:05:10.029> that's<00:05:11.029> cool

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659

we've had rumors and yeah as speculation

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.629 
we've had rumors and yeah as speculation
for<00:05:58.399> years<00:05:58.879> now<00:05:59.209> so<00:05:59.589> we<00:06:00.589> did<00:06:00.769> know<00:06:00.979> we<00:06:01.459> did

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639

think that might be the case but then

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.819 
think that might be the case but then
where<00:06:03.949> there's<00:06:04.099> been<00:06:04.339> a<00:06:04.399> lot<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:05.559> people<00:06:06.559> -<00:06:06.709> no

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169
