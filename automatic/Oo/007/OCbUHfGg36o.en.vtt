00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello together here is the moritz of 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.290
 session music and I show you today 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.960
 a little something new to the brand 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.930
 yamaha dtx 400k the smallest representative 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.930
 from the dtx series much fun 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.160
 although the whole is a beginner james 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 I would still have cool mode 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.159
 with on board and the great is you have 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.870
 10 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.150
 ready-made songs where the jobs 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.100
 could turn on or off so first 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.080
 what are they actually doing? 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.850
 then play yourself you can do this 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.590
 songs but also override ten 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.479
 Places are available and at 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.220
 yamaha has new ones to download 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.890
 I'll just go here now 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.950
 just over the play button song mode 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.630
 and then I can choose one 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.979
 in march there is no display but it is 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.450
 kept pretty simple because you can 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.460
 with these keys up here 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.770
 Select playbacks as well as the kids 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.190
 So it's really super easy 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.160
 standard kit I had just here 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:51.500
 displays goes for example or too 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:57.020
 my frank it and also something here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.740
 is a bit funny with a right 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.180
 closer to us 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.940
 So as I said I was the song mode 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.680
 show I take a playback we 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.420
 have to do a little bit but 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.420
 only with the drums I have my counter 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.910
 what rocking okay 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.500
 ok or have something still in here 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.500
 so far we have a counter 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:58.780
 and if i have some in katy 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:59.549
 Perry jobs from time to time 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.360
 the lawyers 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.860
 We will continue to watch women, I believe 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.130
 now colleague at the recognize 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.130
 could 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.630
 green day 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.230
 So you are here for everyone 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.370
 Taste something with them and what they have 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.200
 have not shown that metronome 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.090
 Of course you can run with me 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.190
 I have now set it on cowbell 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.909
 beautiful penetrates and now with the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.909
 playback together 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.920
 so that too of course that is 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.150
 metronome is in different 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.830
 speeds adjustable 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
 And even if you pedals all the time 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.220
 off the skin because I'm a little too tight 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.480
 I can still thank you for the best wires 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.500
 Let's show you how to use the metronome 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.850
 also the 6 without display of the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.140
 speed can identify 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.570
 just press the button for a long time 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.100
 Keep it simple 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.480
 read the tempo and you can do it 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.620
 with pressed metronome button too 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.980
 enter manually 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:25.240
 slide six namely 13 and writes 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.240
 new tempo or 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.280
 and so you can do the tempo manually 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.780
 just type in a pad if you like 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.240
 So there are many possibilities 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.850
 as far as that goes , just to name a few 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.230
 for the dx 400k you still have in 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.730
 training mode with ten different ones 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.170
 Exercises and I would just go there 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.040
 so that the video does not time 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.940
 frame sprengt recommend goes to yamaha 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.070
 punkt.de everyone finds you next to 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.950
 motorcycles also hifi amplifier but 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.380
 also this yamaha dx 400k as dj set 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.890
 with quite a lot of tutorial videos for 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.480
 the training function and a few completely 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.430
 simple things of his modules of course 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.490
 as with every jamsession moderately 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.010
 namely tempo high down volume for the 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.570
 single kids and you can do that too 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.860
 he also goes into the menu if there is 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.320
 you keep these two buttons pressed 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.420
 There's an excuse for menu items 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.370
 districts of small advantage 7 menu point 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.020
 in the go in then can the 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.970
 example something like the metronome sound 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.340
 control and if you know exactly 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.950
 where something is then he has no problem 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.380
 to find your way around this 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.800
 pay menu and there you can 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.660
 Example also adjust as the pads 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.300
 react from the sensitivity ago 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.620
 So that's all possible and what was 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.850
 may just have heard shortly 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.700
 At the ride Beck what I really cool 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.770
 think you still have a zone 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.770
 but depending on how played 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.290
 Do you have a second sample in there 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.060
 that means it's about velocity 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.220
 controlled and you can with it also the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.360
 Riding bell for example and playing 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.750
 the sgn he of course also exists in 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.340
 puncto grimm schott what that is yes 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.340
 also the thompson of course dynamic 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.570
 and of course you can open the hyatt 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.610
 as you can see the plaster tom you can 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:25.420
 you close normally or close 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:27.340
 So everything is feasible 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.830
 and we have with these first 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.960
 impressions of the dtx 400k first time 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.980
 back to you and of course you look 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.870
 Load definitely times in our 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.250
 over if we are interested 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.260
 have since you can test you can 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.740
 Take home 33 days money back 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.620
 Exchange for 66 days and then look around 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.970
 it plays on my round and that 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.300
 It was then formed until the first 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.300
 next time
