00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.530
 hello today we are going to make this book of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.380
 paperboard 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.570
 in my case it is a rectangle of 23 x 31 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.150
 centimeters and marquez divisions to 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.429
 13 and 18 centimeters 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 to facilitate the bend I'm cutting 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:22.020
 with the cutter without passing 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.830
 to do anything else pressure 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.920
 and that double 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 and that's how easy this is our basis for 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 the craft 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 Now what we have to do is create 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.270
 the pieces that will simulate the leaves of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 our book for that we have to measure 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.360
 the thickness the length and the width 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.360
 considering leaving a margin 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.670
 we also have to consider the thick 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.800
 of the cardboard in my case instead of 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.920
 thickness of five centimeters will remain 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.269
 of 4.8 centimeters 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.660
 leaving rectangles of 12 x 4.8 and 20 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.610
 x 4.8 centimeters 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.790
 Now what we have to do is 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.470
 only go arming that rectangle with 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.970
 cold silicone of preference 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.970
 to dry faster 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.100
 once formed we leave it aside and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.930
 let's cover 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.840
 The cover 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.350
 before lining we are going to create two 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.350
 perforations 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.649
 on the edges of a cover and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.210
 we continue with the lining as if 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.210
 we were a normal book 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.630
 in the lining of the sides fold the 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.740
 corners and we put glue and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.740
 we turn inward 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.490
 we mark again the perforation that 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.130
 we made on paper with what 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.229
 We also cut a rectangle 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.299
 of cardboard to be able to cover the part 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.299
 from inside our book we mark you 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.840
 folding with the help of cardboard base 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.740
 of the book and we mark it very well with a 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 rule or with the cutter 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.459
 before putting the forum we are going to put the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.160
 elastic we are going to introduce the two 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.420
 elastic tips that we have if it is 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.860
 necessary we have to do the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.860
 holes a little bigger 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.480
 since we introduce the two points in 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.840
 one of them we are going to make a knot and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.640
 let's check that it does not go away 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.500
 if we think that the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.460
 elastic we return to make a knot more 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.800
 big 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.390
 then we take the measure of the elastic 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.620
 to flip the book 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 considering the thickness 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.950
 once we measure it we cut and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.950
 we also make a knot on the other side 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.550
 verifying also that it does not leave 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.550
 and that's how it's going to close 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.910
 now if we paste the cardboard with which 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.390
 We will line to cover the knots 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.390
 of the elastic 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.510
 It is recommended to line the inside 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.700
 with short and long rectangles for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.340
 each side of the color of your 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.430
 preference and we have to make a strip 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.440
 long for the entire edge of the part of 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.810
 outside that is going to be the view of the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.670
 leaves of the book so you do not notice the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.370
 edge let's put decorative ribbon 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.739
 we measure 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.069
 cut and bend inward the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.069
 tape 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.330
 and so we're going to do it for all 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.900
 edge of the rectangle only of one 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.900
 only side 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.730
 once finished we started to cover the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.190
 part of inside we put glue 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.379
 we add the rectangles and also by 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.510
 out let's go adding glue and 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.510
 Pasting the lining of the chosen color 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.650
 on the edge where we put tape 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.740
 let's put cold silicone or glue 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.230
 of your preference 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.230
 and we stick to the base of our book 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.750
 and there is so how is terminated 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.940
 once dry and nothing else we close it with 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.060
 the elastic and we can use it to 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.910
 save colors sweet photographs or 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.620
 as a souvenir in some special event 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.600
 Here I leave the link to other videos that
