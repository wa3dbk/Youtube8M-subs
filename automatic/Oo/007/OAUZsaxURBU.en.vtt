we've<00:00:00.870> been<00:00:00.989> talking<00:00:01.410> about<00:00:01.469> this

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
we've been talking about this

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.530 
we've been talking about this
computerized<00:00:02.250> lighting<00:00:02.790> system<00:00:03.179> since<00:00:03.389> we

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
computerized lighting system since we

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.570 
computerized lighting system since we
originally<00:00:03.780> started<00:00:04.080> our<00:00:04.500> rough-in<00:00:04.890> well<00:00:05.400> all

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
originally started our rough-in well all

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.130 
originally started our rough-in well all
the<00:00:05.759> panels<00:00:06.210> are<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.450> now<00:00:06.600> they're<00:00:06.779> hooked<00:00:06.990> up

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the panels are in now they're hooked up

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.650 
the panels are in now they're hooked up
our<00:00:07.740> keypads<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.610> place<00:00:08.910> each<00:00:09.240> one<00:00:09.570> of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
our keypads are in place each one of

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
our keypads are in place each one of
these<00:00:09.750> buttons<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.260> programmed<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.920> start

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
these buttons is programmed to start

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.370 
these buttons is programmed to start
operating<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> lights<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.900> let's<00:00:13.110> bring<00:00:13.259> up

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
operating the lights so let's bring up

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.780 
operating the lights so let's bring up
to<00:00:13.530> speed<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.160> whole<00:00:14.370> thing<00:00:14.610> came

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
to speed on how the whole thing came

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.550 
to speed on how the whole thing came
together<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.630> all<00:00:15.809> started<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.199> running

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
together it all started with running

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
together it all started with running
cable<00:00:16.920> from<00:00:17.070> each<00:00:17.310> light<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:17.820> group<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> lights

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
cable from each light or group of lights

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
cable from each light or group of lights
which<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:18.810> called<00:00:18.990> loads<00:00:19.380> down<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
which are called loads down to the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
which are called loads down to the
mechanical<00:00:20.730> room<00:00:20.910> these<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.510> called<00:00:21.810> home

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
mechanical room these are called home

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.170 
mechanical room these are called home
runs<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.980> allow<00:00:23.220> us<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.519> control<00:00:23.910> each

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
runs and they allow us to control each

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.550 
runs and they allow us to control each
load<00:00:24.539> individually

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
load individually

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950 
load individually
they<00:00:26.189> also<00:00:26.310> set<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.670> keypad<00:00:27.150> locations<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
they also set up keypad locations and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
they also set up keypad locations and
ran<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> low<00:00:28.590> voltage<00:00:28.890> cable<00:00:29.609> from<00:00:29.820> each<00:00:29.970> of

ran a low voltage cable from each of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.139 
ran a low voltage cable from each of
those<00:00:30.300> down<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> mechanical<00:00:31.590> room<00:00:31.740> later<00:00:32.579> we

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
those down the mechanical room later we

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.209 
those down the mechanical room later we
use<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> lighting<00:00:33.809> control<00:00:34.200> software<00:00:34.739> to

Anderson<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.489> us<00:00:59.579> today<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> describe<00:01:00.239> what

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
Anderson with us today to describe what

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.840 
Anderson with us today to describe what
happens<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:02.039> home<00:01:02.309> runs<00:01:02.579> come

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
happens when all these home runs come

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
happens when all these home runs come
down<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> mechanical<00:01:03.719> room<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.290> mean<00:01:04.589> how

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
down a mechanical room so I mean how

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.100 
down a mechanical room so I mean how
does<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> system<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.760> work<00:01:05.970> well<00:01:06.900> Dean

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
does a system like this work well Dean

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
does a system like this work well Dean
we<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.830> loads<00:01:08.070> terminated<00:01:08.909> in

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
we have all your loads terminated in

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
we have all your loads terminated in
this<00:01:09.119> location<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:11.070> we've<00:01:11.189> got

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this location here and what we've got

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
this location here and what we've got
are<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.520> dimming<00:01:12.030> modules<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.780> relay

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
are some dimming modules and some relay

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
are some dimming modules and some relay
modules<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.640> relay

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
modules if you think of these relay

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
modules if you think of these relay
modules<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.290> as

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
modules that's going to be the same as

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
modules that's going to be the same as
an<00:01:16.590> on/off<00:01:16.950> toggle<00:01:17.220> switch<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
an on/off toggle switch in a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
an on/off toggle switch in a
conventionally<00:01:18.869> wired<00:01:19.080> system<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.619> it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
conventionally wired system so it's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.490 
conventionally wired system so it's
simply<00:01:20.369> turning<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.729> load<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> off<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
simply turning a load on and off the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
simply turning a load on and off the
dimmers<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> same<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
dimmers are going to be the same as the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.820 
dimmers are going to be the same as the
dimmer<00:01:24.090> switches<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> conventional<00:01:25.619> system

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
dimmer switches in a conventional system

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
dimmer switches in a conventional system
but<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> dimming<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.880> actually<00:01:27.180> happening

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
but the dimming is actually happening

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
but the dimming is actually happening
here<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.290> these<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.470> tied<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
here and then these are tied into the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
here and then these are tied into the
brains<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> outfit<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.390> exactly

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
can see the orange cables up at the top
there<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.310> bringing<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.820> input<00:01:36.360> from

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
there and that's bringing in input from

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.640 
there and that's bringing in input from
your<00:01:36.659> control<00:01:36.930> keypads

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650

switch it can be a scene preset control
and<00:01:44.280> again<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> take<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> process

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and again it's going to take and process

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
and again it's going to take and process
that<00:01:46.110> information<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> send<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> the

that information and send it out to the
enclosures<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.600> button<00:01:49.229> push<00:01:49.409> might<00:01:49.619> be

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
enclosures a button push might be

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
enclosures a button push might be
something<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.250> simple<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.640> turning<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> relay

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
something as simple as turning a relay

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
something as simple as turning a relay
on<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> off<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.530> could<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.860> controlling<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
on and off or it could be controlling a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.340 
on and off or it could be controlling a
whole<00:01:53.610> room<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.060> 10<00:01:54.299> 20<00:01:54.479> different<00:01:55.020> loads<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
whole room with 10 20 different loads in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
whole room with 10 20 different loads in
it<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.860> whole<00:01:56.219> house<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> master<00:01:57.119> off

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it or the whole house as a master off

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
it or the whole house as a master off
it's<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.560> instantly<00:01:59.009> with

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it's going to do that all instantly with

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's going to do that all instantly with
the<00:01:59.579> push<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.909> button<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the push of a button so that's kind of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
the push of a button so that's kind of
the<00:02:01.110> confusing<00:02:01.530> part<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.159> people<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the confusing part I think of people is

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.459 
the confusing part I think of people is
that<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:03.000> not<00:02:03.180> turning<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> switch<00:02:04.290> off

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
that you're not turning the switch off

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
that you're not turning the switch off
and<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.710> anymore<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.610> exactly<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.119> it's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and on anymore it's exactly right it's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880 
and on anymore it's exactly right it's
one<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> challenges<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.200> face<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> laying

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
one of the challenges we face and laying

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.260 
one of the challenges we face and laying
out<00:02:08.039> these<00:02:08.280> systems<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> getting<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
out these systems is getting the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
out these systems is getting the
homeowner<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.899> understand<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.560> they're<00:02:10.709> no

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
homeowner to understand that they're no

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.340 
homeowner to understand that they're no
longer<00:02:10.830> dealing<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.700> simple<00:02:12.060> on-off

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
longer dealing with just simple on-off

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.200 
longer dealing with just simple on-off
which<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.650> an<00:02:13.920> individual<00:02:14.460> dimers<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.090> now

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
which is an individual dimers we can now

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.390 
which is an individual dimers we can now
have<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> button<00:02:15.960> control<00:02:16.350> whole<00:02:16.590> rooms<00:02:16.890> entire

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
have a button control whole rooms entire

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.580 
have a button control whole rooms entire
parts<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> house<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:19.020> makes<00:02:19.200> their<00:02:19.440> life

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
parts of the house it makes their life

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.200 
parts of the house it makes their life
much<00:02:19.800> easier<00:02:19.830> let's<00:02:20.760> take<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> look<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
much easier let's take a look at the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.370 
much easier let's take a look at the
keypads<00:02:21.600> wants<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.960> talk<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> little<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.350> about

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
keypads wants to talk a little bit about

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.240 
keypads wants to talk a little bit about
how<00:02:22.650> they<00:02:22.800> work

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
how they work

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 
how they work
now<00:02:23.520> again<00:02:23.820> none<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.510> these<00:02:24.630> actually<00:02:24.960> switch

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
now again none of these actually switch

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.670 
now again none of these actually switch
anything<00:02:26.160> off<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.760> by<00:02:27.450> themselves<00:02:27.990> now

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
anything off and on by themselves now

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.200 
anything off and on by themselves now
this<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.070> be<00:02:29.100> basically<00:02:29.610> your<00:02:29.790> interface

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
this would be basically your interface

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.150 
this would be basically your interface
with<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.450> control<00:02:30.870> system<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.560> each<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
with your control system so each one of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.260 
with your control system so each one of
these<00:02:32.220> buttons<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.700> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> send<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
these buttons is going to send a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
these buttons is going to send a
low-voltage<00:02:33.600> signal<00:02:34.200> back<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> central

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
low-voltage signal back to the central

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.440 
low-voltage signal back to the central
control<00:02:35.220> unit<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:35.910> have<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
control unit that we have in the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.510 
control unit that we have in the
backroom<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:38.100> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> take

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
backroom there and it's going to take

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.800 
backroom there and it's going to take
that<00:02:38.670> button<00:02:39.060> push<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.450> then<00:02:39.540> send

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that button push and then send

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.750 
that button push and then send
information<00:02:40.080> out<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.830> relay<00:02:41.130> modules<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
information out to the relay modules the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.130 
information out to the relay modules the
dimmer<00:02:41.970> modules<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.540> are<00:02:42.660> actually<00:02:42.990> doing

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
dimmer modules that are actually doing

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.080 
dimmer modules that are actually doing
the<00:02:43.350> switching<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> loads<00:02:44.400> what<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.910> like

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the switching of the loads what I like

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.450 
the switching of the loads what I like
about<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.960> we're<00:02:46.950> controlling<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
about this is is we're controlling the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.490 
about this is is we're controlling the
entire<00:02:47.760> family<00:02:48.180> room<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.570> exterior<00:02:49.260> lights

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
entire family room here exterior lights

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.710 
entire family room here exterior lights
lights<00:02:49.830> up<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.340> stairway<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.540> all

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
lights up on the stairway and it's all

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.610 
lights up on the stairway and it's all
in<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:51.900> little<00:02:52.020> area<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.320> these<00:02:52.440> were

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
in one little area if these were

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.140 
in one little area if these were
hardwired<00:02:53.190> switches<00:02:53.670> mean<00:02:53.850> we'd<00:02:53.970> have

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
hardwired switches mean we'd have

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.450 
hardwired switches mean we'd have
something<00:02:55.020> about<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.320> wide<00:02:55.530> exactly<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
something about this wide exactly in the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.340 
something about this wide exactly in the
business<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:56.910> call<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.240> wall<00:02:57.450> acne<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.200> it's

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
business we call that wall acne and it's

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.690 
business we call that wall acne and it's
one<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> benefits<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.220> system<00:02:59.250> we're

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
one of the benefits of the system we're

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.950 
one of the benefits of the system we're
going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> take<00:03:00.090> all<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.390> wall<00:03:00.660> clutter

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
going to take all that wall clutter

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.810 
going to take all that wall clutter
condense<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.590> down<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.920> single<00:03:02.280> gang<00:03:02.610> and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
condense it down to a single gang and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.550 
condense it down to a single gang and
then<00:03:03.300> give<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.630> anywhere<00:03:03.840> from<00:03:04.080> 1<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.410> night

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
then give you anywhere from 1 to night

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.080 
then give you anywhere from 1 to night
and<00:03:04.650> buttons<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.190> single<00:03:05.490> gang<00:03:05.700> allowing

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
and buttons in that single gang allowing

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.910 
and buttons in that single gang allowing
you<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.270> control<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.440> room<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.830> even

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you to control all the room and even

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.340 
you to control all the room and even
parts<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.880> house<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.720> we're<00:03:09.870> about<00:03:09.990> three

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
parts of the house so we're about three

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.810 
parts of the house so we're about three
quarters<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.920> way<00:03:11.040> done<00:03:11.220> on<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.550> now<00:03:11.790> I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
quarters of the way done on this now I

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.720 
quarters of the way done on this now I
think<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.240> probably
