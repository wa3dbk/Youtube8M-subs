questions<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> morality<00:00:50.969> well<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:51.870> this

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
questions of morality well I think this

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
questions of morality well I think this
is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.350> question<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.800> morality<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.280> science

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is a question of morality that science

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.479 
is a question of morality that science
has<00:00:53.969> answered<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.680> look<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> details

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
has answered if you look at the details

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
has answered if you look at the details
if<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.809> human<00:00:58.050> embryos<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
if you look at the human embryos that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.639 
if you look at the human embryos that
are<00:00:58.980> destroyed<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.460> stem-cell<00:00:59.879> research<00:01:00.649> what

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
are destroyed in stem-cell research what

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
are destroyed in stem-cell research what
is<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> three-day-old<00:01:02.460> human<00:01:02.910> embryo<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
is a three-day-old human embryo it is a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.420 
is a three-day-old human embryo it is a
collection<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.979> 150<00:01:05.610> cells<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.950> may<00:01:08.189> sound

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
collection of 150 cells that may sound

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.969 
collection of 150 cells that may sound
like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> cells<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.500> laypeople<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.799> does

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
like a lot of cells to laypeople it does

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.219 
like a lot of cells to laypeople it does
but<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> hundred<00:01:12.210> thousand<00:01:12.960> cells

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
but there are a hundred thousand cells

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.640 
but there are a hundred thousand cells
in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> brain<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.430> fly

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
in the brain of a fly

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.100 
in the brain of a fly
now<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.430> seems<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.759> me<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.659> concern<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
now we it seems to me if our concern is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.370 
now we it seems to me if our concern is
about<00:01:19.350> suffering<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.490> universe<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
about suffering in this universe it is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
about suffering in this universe it is
rather<00:01:22.560> obvious<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.520> should<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.790> more

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
rather obvious that we should be more

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.920 
rather obvious that we should be more
concerned<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:25.340> killing<00:01:26.340> flies<00:01:26.720> than<00:01:27.720> about

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
concerned about killing flies than about

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.929 
concerned about killing flies than about
killing<00:01:28.380> three-day-old<00:01:28.829> human<00:01:29.280> embryos<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
killing three-day-old human embryos and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.920 
killing three-day-old human embryos and
this<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.270> may<00:01:30.450> sound<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> very

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
this this may sound like a very

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.499 
this this may sound like a very
provocative<00:01:31.229> claim<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.880> argue<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
provocative claim I would argue that it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.649 
provocative claim I would argue that it
shouldn't<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> details<00:01:35.659> now

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
shouldn't if you look at the details now

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.090 
shouldn't if you look at the details now
many<00:01:36.869> people<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> course<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.710> argue<00:01:37.979> well

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
many people of course will argue well

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.560 
many people of course will argue well
the<00:01:38.189> difference<00:01:38.610> between<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.000> fly<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> a
