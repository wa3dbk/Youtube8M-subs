00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 very severe I'm a copyist and it's from the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.280
 welcome to the temple of time you are 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.889
 reading well we are facing a new top 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 in the channel surely the bosses that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.660
 more we remember are those to whom 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 we are facing for the first time that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.220
 first challenge before us 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 that first stone that was put in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.720
 our path before we become true 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.689
 heroes because we've all had one 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.830
 first time and I bring you my top 5 of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.230
 bosses that led me astray in the zelda saga 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.980
 my top 5 first dungeon bosses 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 there we go 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.109
 in position number 5 in the ass you the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 hinco we have the great coach I want to say 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.969
 the great green pooch of minis cap 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 it really is not very big its size is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 like that of all the boys but when 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.199
 we confront him with our little 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.659
 sword looks like a much bigger pooch 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.210
 Now listen again to everything I've 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.159
 said but instead of pooch as if 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.039
 said to snatch 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.299
 to see what comes of having as good this 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.759
 first boss to an enemy that we 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.500
 we found everywhere and that 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.780
 we easily defeat in our size 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 normal but that being ministers costs 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 so much, it seems to me the truth that very 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.860
 original and the truth is that I enjoyed 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.220
 a lot of killing this youtube so for 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.319
 that and its ways of with bomber de se 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.950
 has won the number 5 spot in this 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:31.140
 ranking of bosses that have delegated me 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.729
 anyone who has played at least one 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.430
 Once in your life at the mercy of Aden is 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.549
 remind this boss water mentos 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 cell for month has my fourth place is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.409
 a kind of unicorn dra 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 although they will throw fireballs at us 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.600
 the first time I confronted him I spent it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.189
 very very bad because good really in your 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.679
 day you is not that it was very good 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.869
 cell and also playing with time 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.360
 I did not have much idea of the mechanics 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.869
 of cell in that sight think that it 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.090
 it was about one of the final bosses who 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.060
 I had gotten myself into a dungeon 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.610
 that no villa or something and we've all 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.920
 been some nobbs sometime and what 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.170
 Demons documents is the first boss of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.720
 the saga zelda the first boss to saga 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.650
 zelda so that's only why I think that 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.379
 he deserves a position in this top 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.739
 in the third place we have the incredible 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.980
 to the unequaled charismatic the terror of 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.730
 the girls the evil and cyrus of the saga the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.569
 sexy grade 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.659
 hey, really speaking seriously, I think 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.420
 those most epic bosses in the saga 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.750
 zelda despite the pints you can 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.569
 have but a sword fight against 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.299
 sword ingestion of penises always cool 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.000
 much more the fact of becoming more 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.400
 late in eye spoiler but pierced is 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.769
 that watford do not follow in this part you 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.130
 I'm giving time let's go the video 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.260
 forward here you wait 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.910
 some great friends of the final game 2 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.800
 spoiler to keep watching the video 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.020
 from here do not worry it gives you a 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.260
 incentive that makes him worthy to be 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.020
 in third place in this top though 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.800
 Now that I think about it, to say that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.900
 great and I think some better bosses than 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.260
 I decided to flirt it sounds pretty bad 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.090
 we pass the following please 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.519
 the truth is that the first place has 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.090
 been very disputed but finally that 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.269
 doorway who falls in the second position 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.540
 maybe because of his screams maybe because of his 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.579
 dance or maybe for his sword but 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.510
 uruguay this those bosses that mark you 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.909
 forever 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.799
 is a giant warrior masked from the 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.500
 jungle that will not put things at all 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:55.209
 easy the first is that I face 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.040
 this thing had just the right time 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.780
 to pass it because at that time no 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.640
 I knew of the existence of the song of 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.480
 time invested and nothing like that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.610
 so I was very, very screwed but 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.159
 finally we got to give it back 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.260
 towards late in time to be this one 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.359
 first boss that I faced with the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.940
 tension of having time against me 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.739
 to go every time less than 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.989
 be about to die because I was 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.560
 the time is over, the truth is that it 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.380
 He made a boss that I will never forget 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.930
 and in the first place we have our 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.270
 preferred rubber spider is also the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.160
 First boss in wind waker but I 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.160
 I sincerely prefer your version of 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.970
 ocarina of time is surely in this 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.100
 Market Stall 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.139
 have only by whatever the character in 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.560
 yes not for everything that has come to 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.320
 mean is the first boss of a game 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.639
 that changed the world of videogames 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.250
 the first boss of a story 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.900
 endearing the first boss that we 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.270
 allowed us to continue in our adventure 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.979
 to try to save the cv tree and 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.139
 to be able to go later to see our 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.780
 princess zelda I think it's a boss that 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.820
 has meant a lot in the saga and 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.610
 For this reason, the first place of 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.180
 top also that has to give us in 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.180
 the eye 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.030
 and nothing more than two up here the video from 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.300
