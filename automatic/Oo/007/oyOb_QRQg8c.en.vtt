Sproles<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.610> he's<00:01:14.760> 95<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> he<00:01:17.490> should

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
Sproles I think he's 95 so he should

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.020 
Sproles I think he's 95 so he should
show<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:19.670> specific<00:01:20.670> version<00:01:20.939> of
