right<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> mean<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
right there so that mean that's going to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
right there so that mean that's going to
be<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.070> crucible<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.729> also

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
know strikes and basically the rest of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.789

them<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.930> upgrades<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.530> I'll<00:01:58.649> go

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
them are kind just upgrades then I'll go

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.160

ahead and put some gameplay of me doing
a<00:02:01.229> mission<00:02:01.439> right<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.149> now<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.259> my

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
a mission right now on it now really my

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920 
a mission right now on it now really my
only<00:02:04.680> complaint<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.579> far<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.540> does

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
only complaint so far is that it does

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.749 
only complaint so far is that it does
glow<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.250> kind<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.849> glow

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
glow you can kind of see that glow

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.420 
glow you can kind of see that glow
green<00:02:10.030> glow<00:02:10.360> there<00:02:10.629> on<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.869> screen<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.470> can

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
green glow there on the screen that can

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.710 
green glow there on the screen that can
get<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> little<00:02:12.909> bit<00:02:13.120> annoying<00:02:13.420> especially

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
get a little bit annoying especially

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.050 
get a little bit annoying especially
during<00:02:14.230> crucible<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.040> because<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.700> block

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
during crucible is because it can block

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.420 
during crucible is because it can block
some<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.110> peripheral<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.950> guess<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.280> would

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
some of the peripheral I guess you would

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.670 
some of the peripheral I guess you would
say<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.540> me<00:02:19.629> of<00:02:19.659> course<00:02:19.840> once<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.290> game<00:02:20.470> down

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
say but me of course once you game down

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.440 
say but me of course once you game down
the<00:02:20.829> sides<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.280> goes<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.790> don't<00:02:21.939> really<00:02:22.090> can't

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the sides it goes you don't really can't

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.030 
the sides it goes you don't really can't
really<00:02:22.689> see<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.049> well<00:02:23.379> but<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.829> mean<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
really see it that well but I mean the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.890 
really see it that well but I mean the
biggest<00:02:24.310> complaint<00:02:24.700> right<00:02:24.939> now<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.510> that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
biggest complaint right now is that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.649 
biggest complaint right now is that
inclusive<00:02:26.620> all<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:28.030> still<00:02:28.239> prefer<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
inclusive all I just still prefer the

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.780 
inclusive all I just still prefer the
auto<00:02:28.780> rifle<00:02:29.260> just<00:02:29.890> because<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> auto<00:02:30.459> rifles

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
auto rifle just because the auto rifles

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.170 
auto rifle just because the auto rifles
have<00:02:30.909> more<00:02:31.120> impact<00:02:31.510> than<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:32.140> fires<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.970> as

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
have more impact than a fires not as

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.890 
have more impact than a fires not as
fast<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:35.079> fast<00:02:35.769> as<00:02:36.069> this<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:36.549> it<00:02:37.480> kills<00:02:37.780> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
fast as fast as this but it kills the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.390 
fast as fast as this but it kills the
enemy<00:02:38.140> quicker<00:02:38.409> at<00:02:38.530> least<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.769> my<00:02:38.890> opinion<00:02:38.950> now

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
enemy quicker at least in my opinion now

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.819 
enemy quicker at least in my opinion now
if<00:02:39.519> you're<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:39.790> good<00:02:39.970> at<00:02:40.030> headshots

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
if you're really good at headshots

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.170 
if you're really good at headshots
perfect<00:02:41.829> gun<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.489> mean<00:02:42.819> if<00:02:42.909> you<00:02:43.000> can

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
upgrading it with that armor piercing

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.809 
upgrading it with that armor piercing
rounds<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.859> increases<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> impact<00:02:51.639> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
rounds that increases the impact and
