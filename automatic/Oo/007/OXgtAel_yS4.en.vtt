00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.240 
good about sticking to my youtube
projects<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.380> fact<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.680> i<00:01:18.800> did<00:01:18.950> stick

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
projects and the fact that i did stick

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.120 
projects and the fact that i did stick
to<00:01:19.370> this<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.700> i<00:01:19.729> think<00:01:20.080> something<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.979> know

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
to this is i think something that I know

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.910 
to this is i think something that I know
works<00:01:23.030> for<00:01:23.360> me<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:23.720> can<00:01:23.930> continue<00:01:24.380> doing<00:01:24.560> it

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
works for me so I can continue doing it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560 
works for me so I can continue doing it
so<00:01:25.190> I'm<00:01:25.430> really<00:01:25.580> looking<00:01:25.670> for<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.030> depth<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.330> 12

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
so I'm really looking for a depth of 12

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.030 
so I'm really looking for a depth of 12
then<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:26.870> can<00:01:27.049> finally<00:01:27.260> get<00:01:27.470> back<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.799> that<00:01:27.830> and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
then I can finally get back to that and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.580 
then I can finally get back to that and
finish<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.280> too<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:29.990> after<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.350> i'm

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.770 
in just to show off the command board
because<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.880> never<00:02:40.090> really<00:02:40.330> showed<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.570> at

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
because I never really showed that at

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.380 
because I never really showed that at
all<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.140> LP<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.700> also<00:02:42.760> want<00:02:43.300> to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
all in the LP and then I also want to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.090 
all in the LP and then I also want to
show<00:02:43.480> how<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> make<00:02:43.930> Mega<00:02:44.350> Flare<00:02:44.440> because<00:02:44.980> that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
show how to make Mega Flare because that

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.440 
show how to make Mega Flare because that
is<00:02:45.250> one<00:02:45.400> command<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.910> I've<00:02:45.970> gotten<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> lot<00:02:46.300> of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
is one command and I've gotten a lot of

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.210 
is one command and I've gotten a lot of
questions<00:02:46.870> asked<00:02:47.320> on<00:02:47.410> how<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.620> make<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.070> and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
questions asked on how to make it and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.190 
questions asked on how to make it and
there's<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.060> video<00:02:49.300> actually<00:02:49.630> if<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.990> search

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
there's a video actually if you search

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.840 
there's a video actually if you search
for<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.680> youtube<00:02:50.770> but<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.190> guess<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.580> might<00:02:51.760> as

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
for it on youtube but I guess I might as

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.430 
for it on youtube but I guess I might as
well<00:02:51.940> make<00:02:52.150> my<00:02:52.360> own<00:02:52.390> sometimes<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.200> that'll

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
well make my own sometimes so that'll

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.590 
well make my own sometimes so that'll
come<00:02:53.560> eventually<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.250> then<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> only<00:02:55.330> other

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
come eventually and then the only other

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.870 
come eventually and then the only other
fire<00:02:56.110> not<00:02:56.530> final<00:02:56.860> episodes<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.670> only<00:02:57.850> other

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
fire not final episodes the only other

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.450 
fire not final episodes the only other
bonus<00:02:58.360> episodes<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.870> had<00:02:58.960> put<00:02:59.170> up<00:02:59.200> are<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.250> ones

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
bonus episodes I had put up are the ones

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.340 
bonus episodes I had put up are the ones
fighting<00:03:00.820> Vanitas<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.510> lingering<00:03:01.780> sentiment

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
fighting Vanitas is lingering sentiment

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.780 
fighting Vanitas is lingering sentiment
and<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.770> mysterious<00:03:03.250> figure<00:03:03.280> which<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
and the mysterious figure which I

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.600 
and the mysterious figure which I
haven't<00:03:04.000> beaten<00:03:04.150> myself<00:03:04.330> yet<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.930> will

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
haven't beaten myself yet but I will

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.460 
haven't beaten myself yet but I will
eventually<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.790> when<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.180> do<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.080> will<00:03:08.320> be

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
eventually and when I do it it will be

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.590 
eventually and when I do it it will be
recorded<00:03:09.010> for<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.550> first<00:03:09.790> time<00:03:09.970> when<00:03:10.210> I<00:03:10.240> try

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
recorded for the first time when I try

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.260 
recorded for the first time when I try
so<00:03:11.550> definitely<00:03:12.550> look<00:03:12.760> forward<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.210> that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
so definitely look forward to that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.330 
so definitely look forward to that
because<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.990> haven't<00:03:14.200> beaten<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.590> me<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:14.950> if<00:03:15.190> I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
because I haven't beaten to me and if I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.949 
because I haven't beaten to me and if I
can<00:03:15.520> get<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.940> first<00:03:16.150> time<00:03:16.390> with<00:03:16.540> me<00:03:16.660> beating

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
can get the first time with me beating

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.600 
can get the first time with me beating
them<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.230> recording<00:03:18.100> then<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.400> would<00:03:18.520> be

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
them on recording then that would be

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.220 
them on recording then that would be
amazing<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.150> every<00:03:19.300> time<00:03:19.360> every<00:03:19.630> time<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.930> try

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
amazing so every time every time I try

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.960 
amazing so every time every time I try
I'll<00:03:20.410> try<00:03:20.440> recording<00:03:20.680> with<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.910> know

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
I'll try recording with it and you know

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.449 
I'll try recording with it and you know
see<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.300> happens<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:22.720> um<00:03:23.590> yeah<00:03:24.280> that's

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
see what happens but um yeah that's

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.400 
see what happens but um yeah that's
pretty<00:03:24.640> much<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.360> don't<00:03:25.959> really<00:03:26.140> know<00:03:26.320> how

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
pretty much it I don't really know how
