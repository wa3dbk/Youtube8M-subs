don't get anything on the sides here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
don't get anything on the sides here
because<00:01:59.610> LG's<00:02:00.000> research<00:02:00.360> says<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.840> really

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
just like that and then as alongside

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.220 
just like that and then as alongside
that<00:04:17.299> I've<00:04:17.420> got<00:04:17.540> my<00:04:17.660> home<00:04:17.840> screen<00:04:18.049> my

these are things you've seen from
previous<00:04:21.109> LG<00:04:21.710> devices<00:04:22.160> but<00:04:22.280> LG's<00:04:22.640> user

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
previous LG devices but LG's user

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.190 
previous LG devices but LG's user
interface<00:04:23.180> much<00:04:23.570> better<00:04:23.780> than<00:04:23.960> what<00:04:24.080> we've

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
interface much better than what we've

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.080 
interface much better than what we've
seen<00:04:24.229> in<00:04:24.560> previous<00:04:25.310> versions<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.700> think<00:04:25.910> back

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
seen in previous versions I think back

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.680 
seen in previous versions I think back
to<00:04:26.240> liked<00:04:26.390> when

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
to liked when

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.020

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.940 
10 2011 at Mobile World Congress I think
of<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.360> user<00:04:29.600> interface<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.680> think<00:04:30.860> of

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
of that user interface and I think of

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.260 
of that user interface and I think of
where<00:04:31.070> we're<00:04:31.190> at<00:04:31.220> now<00:04:31.310> with<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:31.790> device<00:04:32.120> and
