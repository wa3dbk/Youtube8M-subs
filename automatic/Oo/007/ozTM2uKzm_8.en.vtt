00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
smartphone the IP of the opposite

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.370 
smartphone the IP of the opposite
smartphone<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.590> case<00:01:49.380> both

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
smartphone if this is the case both
