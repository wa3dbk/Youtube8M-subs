00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.789 
this could have been caused by my little
tumble<00:01:33.930> row<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.740> a

break<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.490> until<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.720> guy<00:01:42.899> bet<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> until

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
break this until this guy bet it until

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.620 
break this until this guy bet it until
it<00:01:43.500> breaks<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it breaks here so see if I can get this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.539 
it breaks here so see if I can get this
to<00:01:45.810> focus<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.560> bit<00:01:46.710> better<00:01:46.950> maybe<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to focus a little bit better maybe if I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.510 
to focus a little bit better maybe if I
gets<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.880> better<00:01:48.030> light<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:49.220> okay<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.280> here

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
gets a better light in here okay so here

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.560 
gets a better light in here okay so here
we<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> push<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.479> my

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
we go just going to push up with my

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.060 
we go just going to push up with my
fingers<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.049> back<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.530> thumbs<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.920> I'll

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
fingers and back with my thumbs and I'll

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.050 
fingers and back with my thumbs and I'll
see<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.399> happens

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
see what happens

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.280 
see what happens
and<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.720> heard<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.259> crack<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.700> and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
and I heard a little crack there and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.380 
and I heard a little crack there and
that<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:59.070> tiny<00:01:59.430> bit<00:01:59.729> cracking

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that was this little tiny bit cracking

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.779 
that was this little tiny bit cracking
right<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> keep<00:02:02.490> going

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
right here so I'm going to keep going

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.529 
right here so I'm going to keep going
here<00:02:04.759> that's<00:02:05.759> actually<00:02:05.939> pretty<00:02:06.270> quite

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
here that's actually pretty quite

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.990 
here that's actually pretty quite
toughing<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.770> weight<00:02:07.950> into<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> nap<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
toughing it all my weight into a nap and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.290 
toughing it all my weight into a nap and
it's<00:02:09.899> staying<00:02:10.200> together<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:10.800> pretty<00:02:11.069> nice

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
it's staying together it's pretty nice

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's staying together it's pretty nice
you<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.540> imagine<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.230> some

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you can imagine what kind of some

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530 
you can imagine what kind of some
typical<00:02:13.709> forces<00:02:14.280> these<00:02:14.459> stuff<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:15.030> props<00:02:15.300> go

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
typical forces these stuff for props go

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.820 
typical forces these stuff for props go
through<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.209> seem<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.410> one<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
through so I seem to be in one of the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.500 
through so I seem to be in one of the
lucky<00:02:20.069> ones<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.550> gotten<00:02:20.700> non<00:02:21.269> brittle

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
lucky ones that have gotten non brittle

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.790 
lucky ones that have gotten non brittle
props<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.750> can't<00:02:24.989> even<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.380> one<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.560> break

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
props I can't even get this one to break

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.259 
props I can't even get this one to break
here<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.370> try<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.610> bend<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.000> right

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
here I'm going to try and bend it right

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.059 
here I'm going to try and bend it right
here<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.510> break<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.989> off<00:02:28.110> where<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.650> try<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
here just break it off where I try to

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.440 
here just break it off where I try to
break<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.430> right<00:02:29.459> here<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:35.450> that'll

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
break it right here so if I can that'll

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.660 
break it right here so if I can that'll
be<00:02:36.540> good<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.049> real<00:02:37.200> yeah<00:02:37.470> that's<00:02:38.040> cool

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
be good for the real yeah that's cool

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.750 
be good for the real yeah that's cool
nice<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> yes<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:43.200> finally<00:02:43.530> let<00:02:43.799> go<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.310> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
nice so so yes it finally let go and it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
nice so so yes it finally let go and it
kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.090> does<00:02:45.239> look<00:02:45.269> like<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.470> breakages

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
kind of does look like all the breakages

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.729 
kind of does look like all the breakages
that<00:02:47.130> are<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.400> there<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:49.019> took<00:02:49.200> quite<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> lot

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that are out there it took quite a lot

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.229 
that are out there it took quite a lot
of<00:02:49.830> force<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.069> get<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.370> done<00:02:50.519> like<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.819> said<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
of force to get that done like I said I

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.370 
of force to get that done like I said I
have<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.690> feeling<00:02:52.019> they<00:02:52.110> had<00:02:52.230> some

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
have a feeling they had some

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.979 
have a feeling they had some
manufacturing<00:02:52.980> processes<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:54.269> were<00:02:54.540> wrong

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
manufacturing processes that were wrong

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.650 
manufacturing processes that were wrong
with<00:02:55.430> probably<00:02:56.430> plastic<00:02:57.090> or<00:02:57.209> whatever<00:02:57.450> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
with probably plastic or whatever have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.080 
with probably plastic or whatever have
you<00:02:58.190> cool<00:02:59.190> thing<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.760> don't<00:02:59.820> have<00:02:59.940> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
you cool thing is that I don't have to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.310 
you cool thing is that I don't have to
worry<00:03:00.269> about<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.570> anymore<00:03:00.690> since<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
worry about it anymore since I have the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.170 
worry about it anymore since I have the
new<00:03:01.560> prop<00:03:01.829> adapters<00:03:02.430> i<00:03:02.579> can<00:03:02.700> use<00:03:02.880> pretty<00:03:03.090> much

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
new prop adapters i can use pretty much

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.930 
new prop adapters i can use pretty much
any<00:03:03.269> prop<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.750> i<00:03:03.870> want<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.850> I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
any prop that i want but I see it like I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.250 
any prop that i want but I see it like I
said<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> seem<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.600> one<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> lucky<00:03:07.109> ones

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
said I seem to be one of the lucky ones

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.220 
said I seem to be one of the lucky ones
that<00:03:07.560> got<00:03:07.739> them<00:03:08.090> these<00:03:09.090> things<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.750> are

can't even get this thing your break is

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.099 
can't even get this thing your break is
really<00:03:15.440> all<00:03:16.440> right<00:03:17.329> yes<00:03:18.329> sorry<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:18.840> my<00:03:18.959> bad

language over there I actually scraped
myself<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.420> blade<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:21.810> check<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.200> out

myself on the blade there check that out

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.509 
myself on the blade there check that out
as<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.650> came<00:03:22.769> apart<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.630> lovely<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.040> guess<00:03:26.340> I
