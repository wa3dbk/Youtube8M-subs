00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:24.335
Sleep is an eight-hour lullaby

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:26.888
instrumental music, electronic music

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:31.169
In a way it's a question about

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.669
how everything is getting faster

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.020
All our lives are accelerating

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:39.066
and I think, you know,
many of us feel the need

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.226
for a place to rest, a point of repose

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:45.257
and that's what this piece is

00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:47.164
an eight-hour place to rest

00:00:56.215 --> 00:01:00.045
So sleep is also an experiment, really

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:03.993
into how music and consciousness

00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:06.153
can connect in a different way

00:01:06.153 --> 00:01:08.113
It's a piece of night-time music

00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:10.773
and I'm hoping people
will actually sleep through it

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:14.022
It's an area which has 
kind of fascinated me a long time

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:17.172
You know, how the mind
functions while sleeping

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:21.172
and how music can interact with that

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:32.661
We recorded the piece
at Avatar in New York

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.630
which is a classic 
old rock and roll studio

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.060
one of the nicest sounding
string rooms I've ever worked in

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.600
It's just a huge great wooden structure

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:45.963
And they have all the right old toys

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:48.843
There's a beautiful vintage Neve desk

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:51.093
and wonderful old mics and stuff, you know

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.879
And then ACME, the American
Contemporary Music Ensemble

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.235
a string quintet in this case

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:02.186
all of whom are great players
and great guys

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:04.196
We've worked together a long time

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:11.108
And we recorded it in an intense few days

00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:13.056
and it was kind of a challenge actually

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:16.216
It was quite an interesting,
sort of, challenging process

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:30.485
It's mostly very quiet, mostly very slow

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:35.551
and those are things
which are actually not that easy to record

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:37.118
especially for string players

00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:39.658
because it's physically
very demanding on them

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:42.511
You know, long slow bows

00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.355
Nowhere to hide in the music, you know

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:47.585
Every note has to be perfect

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.565
It all has to be perfect, 
otherwise you break the illusion

00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:53.125
It's very, very challenging

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.765
And they're brilliant at that stuff

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:59.605
We had a really fascinating--
actually it was a really good fun time

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.138
It's music that feels very familiar,

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:11.258
I think, to anyone who listens to it

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.308
but it's not at all--

00:03:13.308 --> 00:03:17.418
It's totally transformative in a way

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:21.068
and it's sort of magic
the way it takes you away

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.818
even as a performer

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:25.163
it feels like there's no time
that's passing by

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.143
even though we've just tracked something

00:03:27.143 --> 00:03:29.533
that was 12, 15 minutes long

00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:35.756
It's interesting because--

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:41.291
Even though this music is
written to be slept through

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:44.798
in order to play it, 
you have to be very awake

00:03:45.187 --> 00:03:47.447
because things that are seemingly simple

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:49.957
often are actually difficult to execute

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:53.387
especially executing them over,
and over and over again

00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:05.371
I really enjoy playing Max's music
because of the emotional content

00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:09.416
that's underlining all 
of the things that he writes

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:13.189
so it may have repetition

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:19.717
but there's always this underlying
kind of gripping emotion

00:04:20.113 --> 00:04:21.884
that can sometimes be very dark

00:04:21.884 --> 00:04:24.474
but also be very uplifting and happy

00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:27.314
So for me, it's such a joy

00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:32.084
to really sink your teeth 
into that kind of emotional music

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.404
I mean the musical language of sleep

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:43.344
is deliberately very simple and direct

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.659
It's structured as a set of variations

00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:50.712
I love variation forms anyway

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.117
because they allow you to play

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:55.537
with identity, and memory, and repetition

00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:58.397
and those are things
I really enjoy doing musically

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.469
The piece exists in two versions

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.529
The main work is eight hours long

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.669
It's to be played at night
and hopefully slept through

00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:22.156
I've also made a one hour
daytime listening version

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:23.908
as an alternative

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.958
And now the thing really is

00:05:25.968 --> 00:05:29.158
I'm looking forward to putting
together the live performances

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.288
which is kind of a thing
in itself, you know.

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:34.968
Being on stage for eight hours
playing for a sleeping audience

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.135
I'm looking forward to that experiment
