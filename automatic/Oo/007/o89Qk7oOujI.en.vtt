00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.010
 the pvc coating bain the zaidÃ­n 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.230
 It is a product with a wooden appearance 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.289
 designed to coat walls in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.190
 new remodeling constructions 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.859
 enlargements and so on is manufactured in pp 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.679
 extruded dry and other components that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.599
 next to the filter of its external faces 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.880
 they allow you to have an excellent 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.340
 weather performance 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.680
 Our panels and profiles are 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.500
 manufactured with a technology capable of 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.230
 resist harmful agents by the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.390
 constitution of your material the panels 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.329
 of coating stop the spread 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.600
 of the fire becoming a good 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.159
 protector of your house also resists 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.199
 impacts supporting up to 2 pounds 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.960
 withstands high temperatures without 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.760
 is deformed making it the ideal material 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.939
 for the north of our country 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.759
 its great flexibility makes it a 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.200
 very friendly material difficult to 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.719
 break and easy to install 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.759
 our products for coating 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:21.200
 outside are beginning profiles 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.079
 profiles for doors and windows 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.840
 outer corners that are installed in 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.250
 the joints of two walls 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.830
 inner corner profiles profiles 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.330
 of term 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.330
 outer cover 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.810
 to know how many panels and profiles 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.100
 will occupy must know the dimensions of 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.710
 each wall that you want to cover 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.229
 take measurements of the frames of the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.869
 windows this will give you the amount of 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.830
 jota profiles that you will need to 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.980
 cover the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 we started by reversing the walls with 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.550
 paper insulation timer this paper protects 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.450
 both of the indoor humidity as 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.660
 Exterior 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.120
 the timer paper is very easy to install 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.480
 in wood panels only enough 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.909
 bracket ar and on solid walls is nailed 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.879
 now we put all the corners 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.159
 outside for this the top 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.250
 of the profile should be located at the top 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.230
 line that joins the wall with the eaves for 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.659
 fix them we will use the nails to galvanic 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.580
 one-inch hoists or screws or 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.070
 half-inch tin can 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.750
 to ensure a good fixation is 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.480
 It is necessary for the first nail to be located 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.630
 in the upper part of the hole 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.850
 so that the profile is hanging this is 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.270
 also valid for profiles that 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.340
 install doors and windows a norm 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.950
 both for the cladding panels 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.170
 as for the start and end profiles 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.540
 term is to place the nails in the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.210
 center of the slot leaving about 2 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.100
 millimeters between the nail head and 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.650
 the panel 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.020
 these spaces allow the material 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.460
 slide when it is altered with the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.860
 temperature 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.620
 Start profiles are installed on 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.110
 the bottom of the wall these or 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.420
 have the mission to hook the first 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.970
 coating panel in the middle of this 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.540
 Curved tongue that acts as a liz test 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.689
 before 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.269
 this profile should go to two centimeters 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.409
 before hitting the corner profile 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.849
 outside the nails should go between 30 and 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.849
 40 centimeters away 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.540
 now the coating begins 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.370
 down the lower row riding the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.520
 first panel on the tongue of the profile 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.690
 from start these should also go to 2 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.430
 centimeters of the external corner profile 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.250
 key in the center of the slot leaving 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.460
 the 2 millimeters of necessary clearance and 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.390
 continues to advance like this every 30 or 40 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.910
 centimeters 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.230
 When the length of the wall is greater than 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.209
 of the panel more panels are occupied 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.250
 To do this, mark with a pencil the 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.370
 required dimension 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 then super we put hooked and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.540
 we nail 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.960
 place the second panel on which you already 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.620
 is nailed if it starts from right to 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.810
 left or from left to right 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.930
 have it on all the walls so that the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.420
 overlap and the view remain in the same 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.490
 sense 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.590
 for the installation of the profiles of 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.950
 doors and windows the process is the 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.930
 same in the sections on the sides 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.350
 upper and lower we use the profiles 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.570
 j with the signed support section 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.810
 on the frame and the wincha of holes 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.060
 outside 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.820
 for the rain two cuts are made in the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.940
 top of the profile then folded 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.210
 down to be introduced into the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.419
 continuous vertical profile this makes 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.969
 the water when it slips falls towards the 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.399
 ground 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.009
 when installing around a window 

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:14.159
 just mark the surplus and placing it 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.259
 over the wall in the position that will 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:20.049
 to cover the top we should 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.160
 resort to a profile determined that a 

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:24.020
 the wall with the eaves 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.270
 the term profile is placed in the 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.580
 vertex with the row of holes towards 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.620
 down and still 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.409
 is loose of the corner is begun to 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.180
 nail after measuring the width 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.789
 necessary we cut the panel 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.620
 horizontally then we do the 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.080
 notches on top with the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.409
 cutting machine or with the head of a 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.519
 nail 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.909
 now we place the family hooked and 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:48.909
 ready
