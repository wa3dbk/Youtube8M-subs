good if I don't but I kind of just put
them<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.290> spectrum<00:01:34.860> order<00:01:35.220> they're<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.820> how

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
them out spectrum order they're like how

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
them out spectrum order they're like how
they<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.659> um<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.700> rainbow<00:01:38.970> kind

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
they would um go like on a rainbow kind

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.520 
they would um go like on a rainbow kind
of<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.079> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> stuck

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
of will see that one it's kind of stuck

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.620

so<00:01:40.740> we'll<00:01:40.890> skip<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.310> space<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.880> he'll<00:01:42.479> go

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so we'll skip a space for that he'll go

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.080 
so we'll skip a space for that he'll go
under<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:44.430> basically<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

glycerin<00:02:45.020> or<00:02:45.170> honey<00:02:45.470> is<00:02:45.680> really<00:02:45.950> good<00:02:46.100> to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
glycerin or honey is really good to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.580 
glycerin or honey is really good to
solve<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.580> problem<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.270> didn't<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
solve this problem and I didn't have a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.350 
solve this problem and I didn't have a
dropper<00:02:48.590> eyedropper<00:02:48.980> upstairs<00:02:49.489> cuz<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.270> know

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
dropper eyedropper upstairs cuz you know

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.490 
dropper eyedropper upstairs cuz you know
as<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.630> mentioned<00:02:50.959> I'm<00:02:51.050> not<00:02:51.140> working<00:02:51.410> in<00:02:51.470> my

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
as I mentioned I'm not working in my

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.520 
as I mentioned I'm not working in my
studio<00:02:51.590> um<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.209> what<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.540> here<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:54.080> a

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
studio um so what I have here is a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.870 
studio um so what I have here is a
little<00:02:54.739> bit<00:02:54.860> glycerin<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:55.550> poured<00:02:55.790> it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
little bit glycerin I just poured it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.979 
little bit glycerin I just poured it
into<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.090> little<00:02:56.239> container<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> could

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
into this little container so I could

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.720 
into this little container so I could
drop<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.380> little<00:02:57.530> easier<00:02:57.860> now<00:02:58.370> any<00:02:58.520> of<00:02:58.640> these

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
drop it a little easier now any of these

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.120 
drop it a little easier now any of these
paints<00:02:59.270> like<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.260> know<00:03:00.320> that's<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.680> Windsor<00:03:00.950> Newt

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
paints like I know that's a Windsor Newt

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
paints like I know that's a Windsor Newt
and<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:01.400> not<00:03:01.550> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> be<00:03:01.880> chunky

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
and that's not going to be chunky

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.570 
and that's not going to be chunky
anything<00:03:02.660> there's<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.870> couple<00:03:03.050> cotton<00:03:04.010> academy

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
anything there's a couple cotton academy

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.670 
anything there's a couple cotton academy
colors<00:03:04.880> here<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.209> think<00:03:05.420> might<00:03:05.720> be<00:03:06.050> a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
colors here that I think might be a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.250 
colors here that I think might be a
little<00:03:07.130> um<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:08.000> little<00:03:08.420> person<00:03:08.870> tickity<00:03:09.110> I'm

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
little um a little person tickity I'm

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.900 
little um a little person tickity I'm
just<00:03:09.500> adding<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.950> little<00:03:09.980> drop<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.459> glycerin

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
just adding a little drop of glycerin

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.360 
just adding a little drop of glycerin
now<00:03:11.300> glycerin<00:03:11.750> typically<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.560> your<00:03:13.130> finer

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
now glycerin typically is in your finer

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.890 
now glycerin typically is in your finer
watercolor<00:03:13.880> paints<00:03:14.209> anyway<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:14.810> not

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
watercolor paints anyway so it's not

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.360 
watercolor paints anyway so it's not
going<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.140> harm<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.040> going<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.190> keep

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
going to harm it it's just going to keep

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.520 
going to harm it it's just going to keep
it<00:03:16.519> from<00:03:16.640> drying<00:03:16.940> out<00:03:17.209> completely<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.380> now

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
it from drying out completely and now

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.310 
it from drying out completely and now

these<00:04:10.220> paints<00:04:10.640> are<00:04:10.730> old<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.299> they<00:04:11.690> get<00:04:11.900> kind<00:04:12.230> of

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
these paints are old so they get kind of

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.920
