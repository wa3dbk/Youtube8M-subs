 camry booth eur paschasius not it would 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 in the end yes but i have to face it 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.620
 complete Dutch team with stop 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 bullying out nicely with the pain pointed in 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 move 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.690
 lachman at center when cuddling by the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.879
 fucking take a legend 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 and more natural to concrete on center belly 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.379
 then of course nothing at all seems 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.789
 but I actually get you already 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.350
 nothing really happens to her 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.730
 sorry people that was a lie 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.379
 nothing happens at all but I go here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.270
 a penalty against tim knol carletti 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 front wall wk clips looked and yes you know one 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 little how that works you mentally 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.090
 you take the penalty against tim tuber you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.399
 and perfect all the way 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.769
 martin kromhout a real fucking cunt and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.320
 then here he comes by mondeel scores and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 I think so of wings and archways 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.810
 day actually not how it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 possible 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.630
 because as an arsenal fan you just know that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 this is such a monreal situation 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.090
 is to blame 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.200
 I also had all those logging numbers 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 first changes one of the months 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.780
 reasons is gone again otherwise I will 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.000
 have no idea what the fuck with that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.530
 hand wash but he comes jonkos 2 0 and me 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 really thought yes fuck this i feel 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 sewn 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.920
 what he did all the time was that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.270
 take such a kick so that you get the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 think tank 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.329
 At a certain point you do still realize 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.140
 Don't come with your opponent anymore 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.310
 already has 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 but he still does it and I score 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.610
 therefore the two times he does it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.350
 here again and I intercept dress with 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 jamie lynn he was incredibly fast 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.790
 comes in the laugh man 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.009
 kick a complete fall and everything 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 I am so get a penalty and he 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.290
 rescues the red card and it was already yellow 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 so you can check it so dirty 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 violation that he just gets red 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.390
 but I did get a resit with it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 backup service curl and with pills and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.649
 compressor and faultless 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.680
 now also x completely neatly in half 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.390
 2 2 very nice course of course 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 because of this but I intercepted with 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.829
 mertesacker and I have you 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.649
 ball i give to diaby diabc too 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.259
 walking action over well the salt marsh 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.770
 takes what is in it around the curl 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.320
 excision what oh i hated him 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.030
 but alright I see the screen crash 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.570
 and you know what time it is that is one 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.130
 win 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.600
 that's one with that there are anyway 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.620
 already 2 pack at the end of the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.180
 episode 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.230
 and we just go village it state 11 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.060
 two more points 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.820
 and then we have the championship 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.630
 but then I have to go against this one 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.310
 incredible pitch 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.490
 because seriously what do you do with five the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.850
 pack mertens would also be ibarbo 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.010
 casares just sweetened seriously 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.510
 Is that really still is a good thing 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.100
 so basically why I don't waste it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.270
 so I never want to come across that 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.230
 I also never normally on but 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.430
 now it is 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.550
 and then he comes here by the scores 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.450
 the one against zero hurt him a little 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.450
 I know what you think, by the way 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.580
 of the 1080 p and 60 frames per sec and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.160
 that is what we now incorporate with my lk 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.710
 torii sixty but enough of that to score 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.780
 now the 1st with what I love 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.950
 with him of course but then he comes 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.440
 here to mertens and mertens fever 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.090
 yeah just the moment i thought i could 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.580
 it still survive 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.910
 he scores with ruud martens i was like that 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.980
 close to you so close and then in the 90th 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.650
 minute coffee through to that little one 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.709
 rat and I lose with two and I am still standing 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.570
 still point it is unbelievable how 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.570
 so how long do I need for this 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.560
 division but good 2 packs 2 packs is 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.450
 on might get 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.700
 the 25 kapex seams at the moment and that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.400
 means that I'm going to buy natural 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.830
 12 players the 3-door completely fine 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.290
 of course in a hope that I or it now 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.670
 took shape or just an arsenal player 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.410
 that so naturally be fun for all of them 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.020
 soul or kind are both welcome 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.700
 but well the first package and it is 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.650
 barclay that's here this is the worst 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.420
 25k package that you will probably ever have 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.070
 have seen but you have them anyway 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.330
 opened that he was one all 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.430
 addicted to peitz don't try 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.690
 deny I know very well but whatever 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.250
 have you had it 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.810
 let me know in the comments 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.220
 and then the second one opens and at the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.570
 second you naturally train now you go 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.980
 get something like that because last time 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.780
 shape grease moon 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.850
 well i will tell you i hit it 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.470
 something and that is fifteen hundred point 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.880
 values ​​or something so that is nothing special 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.980
 that I have nothing special but 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.549
 well this is almost the end of the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.650
 episode 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.549
 I want to ask you in advance, given the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.380
 rules 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.060
 suggest a player for me who yes me 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.470
 at the end of the next episode 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.030
 but pick which arsenal player needs that 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.340

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.840
 these methods indeed have 300 likes 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.830
 channels that would be really fantastic 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.750
