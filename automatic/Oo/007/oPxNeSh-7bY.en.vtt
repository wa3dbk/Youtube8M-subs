alright<00:00:01.800> guys<00:00:01.920> here's<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.220> next<00:00:02.520> video<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.000> my

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
alright guys here's the next video in my

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.880 
alright guys here's the next video in my
Wraith<00:00:03.929> challenge<00:00:05.089> this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.930> under

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
Wraith challenge this is the under

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.620 
Wraith challenge this is the under
linkage<00:00:09.260> supplied<00:00:10.260> by<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> vanquish<00:00:11.480> ended<00:00:12.480> up

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
linkage supplied by a vanquish ended up

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749 
linkage supplied by a vanquish ended up
doing<00:00:13.110> both<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> upper<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> lowers<00:00:14.370> front

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
doing both the upper and lowers front

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.660 
doing both the upper and lowers front
and<00:00:14.969> rear<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> basically<00:00:16.920> need<00:00:17.130> four<00:00:17.430> sets

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and rear so you basically need four sets

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.140 
and rear so you basically need four sets
of<00:00:17.760> these<00:00:17.910> things<00:00:18.500> to<00:00:19.500> complete<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.160> entire

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
of these things to complete a entire

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.980 
of these things to complete a entire
Wraith<00:00:21.859> these<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:23.130> titanium<00:00:25.820> rods<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.269> believe

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
Wraith these are titanium rods I believe

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
Wraith these are titanium rods I believe
like<00:00:28.289> three<00:00:28.590> sixteen<00:00:29.160> seven<00:00:29.490> inches<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
like three sixteen seven inches the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.630 
like three sixteen seven inches the
diameter<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.779> them<00:00:31.050> might<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.040> millimeters

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
diameter of them might be millimeters

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
diameter of them might be millimeters
I'm<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.910> sure

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I'm not sure

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
I'm not sure
and<00:00:34.290> then<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.620> supply<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> eyelets<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and then they supply all the eyelets and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.080 
and then they supply all the eyelets and
also<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.590> flanges<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:38.850> write

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
also the little flanges that they write

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
also the little flanges that they write
inside<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.670> pretty<00:00:41.670> much<00:00:42.260> bolted<00:00:43.260> all

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
inside of so pretty much bolted all

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.979 
inside of so pretty much bolted all
these<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:43.950> went<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.730> easily<00:00:44.989> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
these up they went in pretty easily the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.229 
these up they went in pretty easily the
one<00:00:46.140> thing<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.090> baffled<00:00:48.090> at

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
one thing that I was kind of baffled at

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.740 
one thing that I was kind of baffled at
was<00:00:48.649> how<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.640> bolt<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
was how you get to the bolt that this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.610 
was how you get to the bolt that this
thing<00:00:51.989> sits<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> ended<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.620> unbolting

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
thing sits into so I ended up unbolting

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.910 
thing sits into so I ended up unbolting
all<00:00:55.800> four<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.280> drop<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.360> whole<00:00:57.920> skid

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
all four of these drop the whole skid

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
all four of these drop the whole skid
plate<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> has<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> motor<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
plate that has the motor and the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.110 
plate that has the motor and the
drivetrain<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> everything<00:01:01.800> attached<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
drivetrain and everything attached to it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
drivetrain and everything attached to it
and<00:01:03.239> realized<00:01:03.570> there's<00:01:03.840> nothing<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and realized there's nothing in there so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.890 
and realized there's nothing in there so
I<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.000> slits<00:01:06.420> right<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I see these little slits right here I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.390 
I see these little slits right here I
drop<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:08.090> 1.5<00:01:09.090> millimeter<00:01:10.040> wrench<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> there

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
drop in a 1.5 millimeter wrench in there

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
drop in a 1.5 millimeter wrench in there
and<00:01:11.780> all<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.930> sudden<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> set<00:01:13.650> screw

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and all of a sudden there's a set screw

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.690 
and all of a sudden there's a set screw
in<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:15.240> thing<00:01:15.450> rides<00:01:15.630> onto<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
in there that this thing rides onto so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
in there that this thing rides onto so
that's<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.560> other<00:01:19.710> thing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that's how you do that the other thing

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.289 
that's how you do that the other thing
that's<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.549> challenging<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that's you know pretty challenging is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.190 
that's you know pretty challenging is
the<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:22.380> nuts<00:01:22.740> right<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.240> sit

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the little nuts right here that they sit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.490 
the little nuts right here that they sit
on<00:01:25.229> -<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:27.210> can't<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.630> any<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.170> wrench<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
on - you can't get any kind of wrench in

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
on - you can't get any kind of wrench in
there<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
there so this one you can get one that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
there so this one you can get one that
maybe<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.200> smaller<00:01:31.500> T<00:01:32.340> wrenches<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> there

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
maybe the smaller T wrenches in there

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
maybe the smaller T wrenches in there
but<00:01:33.270> ended<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.110> hitting<00:01:34.439> needle<00:01:35.009> nose

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
but ended up just hitting needle nose

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
but ended up just hitting needle nose
pliers<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> hold<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.960> net<00:01:37.259> while<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
pliers to hold the the net while you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
pliers to hold the the net while you
unscrew<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> screw<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.880> other<00:01:39.689> than<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> if

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
unscrew and screw so other than that if

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
unscrew and screw so other than that if
they<00:01:40.290> went<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.770> easily<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> little

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
they went in pretty easily it's a little

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.450 
they went in pretty easily it's a little
bit<00:01:41.820> difficult<00:01:42.030> getting<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> angle<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
bit difficult getting the angle of the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.149 
bit difficult getting the angle of the
eyelets<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> pretty<00:01:46.979> much<00:01:47.100> just

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
eyelets you have to pretty much just

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
eyelets you have to pretty much just
kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> eyeball<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.509> make<00:01:48.840> sure<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.079> got

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
kind of eyeball it and make sure you got

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960 
kind of eyeball it and make sure you got
some<00:01:49.409> play<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
some play in there you don't want it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.730 
some play in there you don't want it
binding<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.549> causing<00:01:53.549> anything<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.740> break

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
binding up and causing anything to break

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.950 
binding up and causing anything to break
off<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.219> little<00:01:56.490> plastic<00:01:57.119> tabs<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.899> here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
off these little plastic tabs right here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.700 
off these little plastic tabs right here
that<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.399> bad<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.649> other<00:02:01.649> than

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that would be kind of bad and other than

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.050 
that would be kind of bad and other than
that<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.399> should<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> pretty<00:02:02.969> good

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that this should be a pretty good

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.420 
that this should be a pretty good
upgrade<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.659> seems<00:02:03.990> very<00:02:04.350> stiff<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
upgrade it seems very stiff on the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.680 
upgrade it seems very stiff on the
underside<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> car<00:02:07.110> now<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.560> hopefully

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
underside of the car now so hopefully
