00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
now this requires our open a bomb that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
now this requires our open a bomb that
is<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> resource<00:01:07.140> drain<00:01:07.439> but

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
is a bit of a resource drain but

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
is a bit of a resource drain but
sometimes<00:01:08.159> shops<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.729> bombs<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.600> ropes<00:01:10.110> or
