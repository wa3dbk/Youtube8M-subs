00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.050
 hi I decided to do this 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.750
 this video because very often during 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.119
 the lessons all my parents ask me 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.000
 always information about the sound of 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:29.169
 Effective alias players chosen of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.540
 pick up what kind of pedal to choose or 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.790
 insert in your pedal valves 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.790
 with the etc. and for this it was decided 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.310
 to hold live music academy sound a 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.489
 iter is a five- stage internship 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 ne equal sissceri or completely all 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.690
 these topics with practical examples 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.850
 because each participant can 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.800
 precisely by their use 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.710
 instrumentation assemble his 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600
 pedal board to get more sound 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.220
 effective taking full advantage of the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.470
 potential of our tools 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.960
 ok then and for this reason that 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.740
 I will use this guitar that the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 ps with pick up in hand to make you feel 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 how to make the most of a minimal tap 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.259
 compared to what a 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 great guitarist wholesale tour 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.630
 obtaining very similar sounds 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.759
 true to what we feel 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.399
 really in my records and for that 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.759
 video with decided to adopt choose 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.979

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.539
 small samples that I will make you feel and 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.569
 now, however, take a little trip 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:41.490
 to explain what you used to 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.680

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.840
 of the methods I use for the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.200
 realization of these audios that if for 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.100
 feel paired with a 19 60 marshall 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.430
 with interjet and miked with one 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.009

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.780
 you will hear is a mental time factor 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.720
 obviously stereo mode then 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.600
 you will feel the two of her two of her that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.530

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.690
