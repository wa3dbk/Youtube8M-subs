actually do to speed up your iOS device
for<00:00:09.450> example<00:00:10.519> we're<00:00:11.519> starting<00:00:11.849> your<00:00:11.969> device

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
for example we're starting your device

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.360 
for example we're starting your device
all<00:00:12.540> together<00:00:12.900> through<00:00:13.230> itunes<00:00:13.679> or<00:00:13.920> just

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
all together through itunes or just

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.250 
all together through itunes or just
resetting<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.880> settings<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.080> device

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
but there's even easier way to just

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.290 
but there's even easier way to just
speed<00:00:19.230> up<00:00:19.260> your<00:00:19.500> iOS<00:00:19.800> device<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.670> make<00:00:21.119> it

feel<00:00:21.510> super<00:00:22.050> super<00:00:22.410> fast<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:22.970> today<00:00:23.970> were

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
feel super super fast now today were

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.550 
feel super super fast now today were
going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.390> take<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> look<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to accessibility in general and here you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.779 
to accessibility in general and here you
want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> reduce<00:00:52.289> motion<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.010> turn<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
want to go to reduce motion and turn it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.299 
want to go to reduce motion and turn it
on<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.320> disable

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
on now what this will do is will disable

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.910 
on now what this will do is will disable
parallax<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> effect<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> iOS<00:00:58.890> 7

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
parallax which is the effect in iOS 7

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.029 
parallax which is the effect in iOS 7
that<00:00:59.370> makes<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.820> icons<00:01:00.270> float<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.559> your

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
that makes your icons float and your

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.969 
that makes your icons float and your
background<00:01:02.309> seem<00:01:03.000> 3d<00:01:03.660> ish<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.500> everything

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
background seem 3d ish so everything

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.960 
background seem 3d ish so everything
just<00:01:05.189> sort<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> 3d<00:01:06.950> effect<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
just sort of has a 3d effect but it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.170 
just sort of has a 3d effect but it
slows<00:01:09.210> down<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> device<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:11.030> something<00:01:12.030> else

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
slows down the device and something else

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.219 
slows down the device and something else
that<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> reduce<00:01:12.780> motion<00:01:13.220> does<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> also

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
that the reduce motion does is it also

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
that the reduce motion does is it also
disables<00:01:16.229> animations<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.850> iOS

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
disables animations now if you're on iOS

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
disables animations now if you're on iOS
7<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.900> you've<00:01:19.110> been<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.740> seven<00:01:20.040> for

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
7 or if you've been now at seven for

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
7 or if you've been now at seven for
quite<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> while<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> animations

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
quite a while you know that animations

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
quite a while you know that animations
are<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.070> much<00:01:23.250> slower<00:01:23.520> than<00:01:23.640> iOS<00:01:24.000> 6<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
are just so much slower than iOS 6 and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
are just so much slower than iOS 6 and
if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> want<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.560> quick<00:01:25.830> fix<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
if you want a really quick fix for this

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
if you want a really quick fix for this
just<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.670> table<00:01:30.150> reduce

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
just just you know just in table reduce

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
just just you know just in table reduce
motion<00:01:31.290> here's<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> does<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.570> see

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
motion here's what it does you can see

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
motion here's what it does you can see
everything<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.740> instant<00:01:35.280> let's<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.670> for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
everything is just instant let's go for

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
everything is just instant let's go for
example<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> app<00:01:36.869> shopper<00:01:37.200> everything<00:01:38.159> open

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
example to app shopper everything open

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.149 
example to app shopper everything open
up<00:01:38.579> instantly<00:01:39.479> pretty<00:01:39.780> much<00:01:39.960> app<00:01:40.439> store

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
up instantly pretty much app store

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609 
up instantly pretty much app store
easily<00:01:41.360> everything<00:01:42.360> gets<00:01:42.540> opened<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.140> within

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
easily everything gets opened up within

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
easily everything gets opened up within
a<00:01:43.829> second<00:01:44.369> even<00:01:44.610> even<00:01:45.479> faster<00:01:45.810> than<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
a second even even faster than that and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889 
a second even even faster than that and
I<00:01:46.259> think<00:01:46.290> even<00:01:46.729> folders<00:01:47.729> open<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.240> faster<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
I think even folders open up faster so
