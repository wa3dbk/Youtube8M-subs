00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:10.620
 and I say 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.130
 let's hope that the world is something that the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.130
 people can 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.500
 and exploded come surprises 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 I like to exploit men like the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.770
 palomita and pedrÃ­n costs and suddenly in 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.399
 winter is a title that is called 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.399
 pedrito 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.090
 Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 of its green environment of being green 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.729
 forward on a car that is called 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.729
 crashing clear 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.790
 the tube that I will go 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.480
 I'm going fourth 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.660
 I'm going fourth good 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.660
 for this site 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.660
 we go for a race for a boat but what 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.660
 are you counting 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.210
 I can prevent 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.869
 what is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.900
 to vary the vanity no no no no 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.369
 yes 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.790
 voice 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.790
 we will win 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 I believe that because they are already going 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.480
 boada 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.290
 they are returned 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.490
 and in cinematics I do not like me 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.130
 neither is calculating 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.800
 calculation 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.100
 I will not arrive 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.100
 this site 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.610
 again the cinematic fucking for the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.390
 words of goals and came now if I get 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.390
 Now if I come, let's go 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.099
 We were caught by a pillor who caught 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.560
 too much ramp mesh 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.090
 today or clothes do not shit 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.319
 I'm silly, it's true that there are so many and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.920
 so many arrived from Seville is 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.920
 impossible 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.900
 that's different the jump was there 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.480
 awesome awesome awesome mom 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.480

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.970
 let's go as you 're going to see how everyone like 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.040
 motivates crystal like that if it breaks 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.040
 in power and the crystal breaks 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.020
 I think he has a glass to see if it breaks 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.330
 the perfect cue 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.010
 left-right to the middle and to 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.010
 in 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.720

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.310

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.500

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.969

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:41.669
