00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
everything else is contained within the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.270 
everything else is contained within the
lungs<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> look<00:00:36.420> my<00:00:37.200> trachea<00:00:37.500> how<00:00:37.890> far<00:00:38.129> down

this<00:00:42.570> amazing<00:00:42.870> thing<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.410> bifurcates<00:00:43.969> what

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
this amazing thing it bifurcates what

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.420 
this amazing thing it bifurcates what
holy<00:00:46.530> bifurcation<00:00:48.079> trachea<00:00:49.190> bifurcates<00:00:50.190> into

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
holy bifurcation trachea bifurcates into

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.500 
holy bifurcation trachea bifurcates into
two<00:00:51.390> tubes<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.620> look<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.820> tracheas

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
two tubes that look like little tracheas

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689 
two tubes that look like little tracheas
but<00:00:55.320> they're<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.980> we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> talk

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
but they're not and we're going to talk

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.580 
but they're not and we're going to talk
about<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.090> next<00:00:57.449> those<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.809> bronchus<00:00:58.640> um

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
about them next those are bronchus um

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.210 
about them next those are bronchus um
but<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> bronchi<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.870> contained<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but the bronchi are contained in the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.960 
but the bronchi are contained in the
lungs<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.180> could<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> lung<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
lungs so you could take a lung out and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600 
lungs so you could take a lung out and
cut<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.070> inside<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.130> lung

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
cut it all up and inside that lung

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
cut it all up and inside that lung
you're<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.420> sorts<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you're going to have all sorts of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
you're going to have all sorts of
structures<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:14.070> where<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.490> going

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
structures and that's where we're going

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.260 
structures and that's where we're going
next

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270

pronounced<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.370> spelled

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
pronounced like that it's just spelled

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.420 
pronounced like that it's just spelled
like<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> diaphragm<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.530> actually<00:02:44.220> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
like that so the diaphragm is actually a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.020 
like that so the diaphragm is actually a
skeletal<00:02:45.150> muscle<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.470> will<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.970> be

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
skeletal muscle that we will know and be

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.810 
skeletal muscle that we will know and be
able<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.450> identify<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.380> when<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> skeletal

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
able to identify and when the skeletal

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.360 
able to identify and when the skeletal
muscle<00:02:51.150> contracts<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.290> actually<00:02:52.800> increases

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
muscle contracts it actually increases

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.020 
muscle contracts it actually increases
the<00:02:53.730> volume<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.870> thoracic<00:02:55.230> cavity<00:02:56.030> what

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the volume of the thoracic cavity what

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.449 
the volume of the thoracic cavity what
else<00:02:57.330> was<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.230> thoracic<00:02:58.440> cavity

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459

inside<00:04:43.319> here<00:04:44.069> is<00:04:44.219> the<00:04:45.090> pleural<00:04:45.509> cavity<00:04:46.009> it<00:04:47.009> is

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
inside here is the pleural cavity it is

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.809 
inside here is the pleural cavity it is
so<00:04:48.120> awesome<00:04:48.560> this<00:04:49.560> space<00:04:49.949> right<00:04:50.279> here<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.759> a

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
so awesome this space right here is a

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.929 
so awesome this space right here is a
potential<00:04:51.779> space<00:04:52.259> that<00:04:53.129> is<00:04:53.279> filled<00:04:53.520> with<00:04:53.639> what

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
potential space that is filled with what

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:59.899 
potential space that is filled with what
kind<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.150> fluid<00:04:56.120> serous<00:04:57.120> fluid<00:04:57.289> and<00:04:58.729> I'm<00:04:59.729> just

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
kind of fluid serous fluid and I'm just

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.959 
kind of fluid serous fluid and I'm just
going<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.120> tell<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:00.509> right<00:05:01.020> now<00:05:01.289> that<00:05:01.969> the

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
going to tell you right now that the

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.459 
going to tell you right now that the
pressure<00:05:03.330> inside<00:05:03.840> here<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.979> low<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:07.319> don't

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
pressure inside here is low and I don't

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.589 
pressure inside here is low and I don't
want<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:07.680> get<00:05:07.800> too<00:05:07.979> crazy<00:05:08.159> into<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.759> but<00:05:09.120> the

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
want to get too crazy into it but the

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.300 
want to get too crazy into it but the
fact<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.080> inside<00:05:11.069> this<00:05:11.719> space<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.770> intra

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
fact that inside this space the intra

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.219 
fact that inside this space the intra
pleural<00:05:14.789> space<00:05:15.029> between<00:05:15.779> the<00:05:15.930> parietal

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
pleural space between the parietal

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.679 
pleural space between the parietal
pleura<00:05:16.529> and<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.099> visceral<00:05:17.490> pleura<00:05:17.689> inside

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
pleura and the visceral pleura inside

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.110 
pleura and the visceral pleura inside
that<00:05:18.900> space<00:05:19.139> it<00:05:19.560> maintains<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.490> low<00:05:20.729> pressure

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
that space it maintains a low pressure

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.679 
that space it maintains a low pressure
zone<00:05:21.509> and<00:05:22.439> so<00:05:23.310> you're<00:05:23.490> lungs<00:05:23.759> stay<00:05:24.060> inflated

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
zone and so you're lungs stay inflated

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.959 
zone and so you're lungs stay inflated
because<00:05:25.169> your<00:05:25.439> lungs<00:05:25.650> have<00:05:25.800> more<00:05:26.339> pressure<00:05:26.669> in

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
because your lungs have more pressure in

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.610 
because your lungs have more pressure in
them<00:05:27.499> that<00:05:28.499> is<00:05:28.919> why<00:05:29.449> your<00:05:30.449> lungs<00:05:30.749> do<00:05:31.439> not

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
them that is why your lungs do not

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.279 
them that is why your lungs do not
collapse<00:05:32.039> and<00:05:32.490> in<00:05:32.939> fact<00:05:33.150> if<00:05:33.389> your<00:05:33.719> lung<00:05:33.990> does

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
collapse and in fact if your lung does

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.740 
collapse and in fact if your lung does
collapse<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:34.979> means<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.639> you<00:05:35.909> lost<00:05:36.210> this

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
collapse it means that you lost this

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.010 
collapse it means that you lost this
low-pressure<00:05:37.319> zone<00:05:37.529> in<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.789> space<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.509> then

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
low-pressure zone in that space and then

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.499 
low-pressure zone in that space and then
they<00:05:40.139> stick<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.529> tube<00:05:41.009> in<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.430> space<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.389> they

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
they stick a tube in that space and they

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.269 
they stick a tube in that space and they
suck<00:05:42.930> out<00:05:43.110> all<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.409> fluid<00:05:43.740> in<00:05:43.860> all<00:05:44.009> the<00:05:44.129> air

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
suck out all the fluid in all the air

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.790 
suck out all the fluid in all the air
and<00:05:44.310> try<00:05:44.819> to<00:05:44.879> re-establish<00:05:45.770> basically<00:05:46.770> a

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
and try to re-establish basically a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.639 
and try to re-establish basically a
vacuum<00:05:47.339> a<00:05:47.520> low-pressure<00:05:48.120> zone<00:05:48.500> that's<00:05:49.500> what

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:49.649 
vacuum a low-pressure zone that's what

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.499 
vacuum a low-pressure zone that's what
keeps<00:05:49.800> your<00:05:49.979> lungs<00:05:50.279> inflated<00:05:50.879> that's<00:05:51.089> crazy

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
keeps your lungs inflated that's crazy

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.290 
keeps your lungs inflated that's crazy
talk<00:05:51.990> that's<00:05:52.949> physio<00:05:53.430> we'll<00:05:53.669> try<00:05:53.849> not<00:05:53.879> to<00:05:54.060> get

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
talk that's physio we'll try not to get

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.010 
talk that's physio we'll try not to get
too<00:05:54.360> crazy<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.259> excited<00:05:55.710> about<00:05:55.919> that<00:05:57.020> your

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
too crazy and excited about that your

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.269 
too crazy and excited about that your
lungs<00:05:58.379> are<00:05:58.800> not<00:05:59.219> symmetrical<00:06:00.180> why<00:06:00.960> not<00:06:01.279> why

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
lungs are not symmetrical why not why

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.420 
lungs are not symmetrical why not why
not<00:06:02.310> that's<00:06:02.759> so<00:06:03.180> so<00:06:04.050> lame<00:06:04.789> why<00:06:05.789> not

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
not that's so so lame why not

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.360 
not that's so so lame why not
because<00:06:08.430> your<00:06:08.669> heart<00:06:09.439> you<00:06:10.439> have<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.889> have<00:06:11.069> room

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
because your heart you have to have room

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.159 
because your heart you have to have room
for<00:06:11.399> your<00:06:11.759> heart<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.149> your<00:06:12.360> heart<00:06:12.689> kind<00:06:13.020> of

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
for your heart and your heart kind of

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.649 
for your heart and your heart kind of
leans<00:06:13.589> a<00:06:14.069> little<00:06:14.099> bit<00:06:14.610> toward<00:06:15.029> the<00:06:15.120> left<00:06:15.419> it's

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
leans a little bit toward the left it's

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.240 
leans a little bit toward the left it's
actually<00:06:16.020> in<00:06:16.229> the<00:06:16.379> middle<00:06:16.589> of<00:06:16.620> your<00:06:16.800> body<00:06:16.979> but

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
actually in the middle of your body but

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.429 
actually in the middle of your body but
the<00:06:17.490> bigger<00:06:17.669> part<00:06:18.029> goes<00:06:18.659> to<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.050> left<00:06:19.259> side

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
the bigger part goes to the left side

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.110 
the bigger part goes to the left side
that<00:06:19.680> is<00:06:19.860> my<00:06:20.099> left<00:06:20.310> side<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.849> so<00:06:21.599> your<00:06:22.050> left

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
that is my left side and so your left

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.309 
that is my left side and so your left
lung<00:06:24.120> has<00:06:24.149> two<00:06:24.899> lobes<00:06:26.300> again<00:06:27.300> containing<00:06:28.110> all

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
lung has two lobes again containing all

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.079 
lung has two lobes again containing all
the<00:06:28.889> rest<00:06:29.069> of<00:06:29.279> the<00:06:29.460> structures<00:06:29.849> we're<00:06:29.969> going

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
the rest of the structures we're going

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.089 
the rest of the structures we're going
to<00:06:30.180> talk<00:06:30.330> about<00:06:30.569> your<00:06:31.319> right<00:06:31.560> lung<00:06:31.800> has<00:06:31.830> three

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
to talk about your right lung has three

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.540 
to talk about your right lung has three
lobes<00:06:33.560> this<00:06:34.560> would<00:06:34.770> be<00:06:34.889> a<00:06:34.919> phenomenal

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
lobes this would be a phenomenal

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.990 
lobes this would be a phenomenal
question<00:06:35.909> if<00:06:36.539> I<00:06:36.959> like<00:06:37.229> could<00:06:37.529> find<00:06:38.099> lungs<00:06:38.550> and

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
question if I like could find lungs and

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.150 
question if I like could find lungs and
they<00:06:39.779> had<00:06:40.080> one<00:06:40.409> had<00:06:40.589> two<00:06:40.740> lobes

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
they had one had two lobes

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.770 
they had one had two lobes
one<00:06:41.280> had<00:06:41.400> three<00:06:41.580> lobes<00:06:41.760> you<00:06:42.060> could<00:06:42.240> tell<00:06:42.540> me

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
one had three lobes you could tell me

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.690 
one had three lobes you could tell me
did<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.560> come<00:06:43.710> from<00:06:43.740> the<00:06:43.980> right<00:06:44.130> side<00:06:44.370> or<00:06:44.550> the

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
did it come from the right side or the

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.460 
did it come from the right side or the
left<00:06:44.880> side<00:06:45.030> of<00:06:45.390> the<00:06:45.570> body<00:06:46.760> mums<00:06:47.760> I<00:06:48.320> feel<00:06:49.320> very

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
left side of the body mums I feel very

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.280 
left side of the body mums I feel very
satisfied<00:06:50.070> with<00:06:50.100> this<00:06:50.400> do<00:06:50.640> you<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:52.050> whole

satisfied with this do you the whole

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.170 
satisfied with this do you the whole
series<00:06:52.800> membrane<00:06:53.250> thing<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.610> making<00:06:53.940> sense

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
series membrane thing is making sense

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.400 
series membrane thing is making sense
isn't<00:06:54.450> it<00:06:54.740> guys<00:06:55.740> are<00:06:55.920> so<00:06:56.100> smart
