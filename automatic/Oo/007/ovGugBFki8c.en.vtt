00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.379
 awesome what about television now 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.529
 it has endless possibilities 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.789
 you're already impressed because 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.520
 it has nothing to do with television 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.130
 as we always knew her 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.480
 we keep calling television but now 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.050
 I know that we will be able to do in the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.070
 future of all the less we're going to 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.070
 do is going to be watching television 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.760
 yes I think so because it opens you up in that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.620
 a whole world of possibilities 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 home entertainment the same as 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.710
 you were doing away from home now you're going to have 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.540
 the possibility but comfortably in your 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.180
 house not play watch cinema television 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 computer or internet then I think 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 that yes the future is there respect 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.290
 comparing with the models of the year 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.970
 past yes everything compared with something not 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.430
 it's pretty good they have outlined the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.110
 much more edges rise part 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.540
 completely metallic back has been 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.400
 forgotten the plastic in the material 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.380
 then, well, a much more line 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 elegant as in the foot I think that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.190
 we are a little the characteristics 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.670
 general and we have to compare with the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.670
 previous year 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.300
 man especially with what we have 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.310
 could see in the appointment the change over 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.890
 everything seen in simplicity the menus 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.480
 is much cleaner last year yes that 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.880
 we do not see ourselves a little more cumbersome 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.980
 seats can be observed when you have 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.360
 with the different labels with the 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.970
 different plates to be able to pass 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.600
 menu to the menu much cleaner and more 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.600
 intuitive 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.040
 how is a change people have to 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.520
 start to see that they have to forget a 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.900
 part of the computer to have everything 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.640
 that once had the organ to have it 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.660
 now on TV and to be able to have 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.070
 TV on demand 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.990
 I also believe now we have a good 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.300
 moment that is with the European Championship and with the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.390
 olympic games if you hear and if this does not 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.229
 produces the input something to produce nothing 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.800
 well the truth by design has 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.010
 delighted is a very thin frame 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 I do not know another television that has it fine 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.900
 apart also the thickness is very very 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.370
 small and then the software that it brings is 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.250
 very complete not for me I do not think it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 need another other device apart for 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.540
 to interactuate 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.180
 and if for me there are many 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.920
 places right now that have a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.670
 computer connected right to the screen 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.580
 and else 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.980
 I think with this TV you can 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.440
 make your life on the network 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.599
 while you can be enjoying 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.010
 the contents of television or of 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.459
 any other source you have 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.459
 connected 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.020
 I loved it personally 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.910
 I had tried it and it is amazing 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.160
 another word and especially also the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.160
 2d conversion to spectacular 3d
