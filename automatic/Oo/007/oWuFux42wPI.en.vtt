as a bonus feature for you guys we have
a<00:00:11.139> 2012<00:00:12.139> Audi<00:00:12.469> q5<00:00:13.040> this<00:00:13.730> is<00:00:13.880> their<00:00:14.030> small<00:00:14.330> SUV

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
a 2012 Audi q5 this is their small SUV

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.390 
a 2012 Audi q5 this is their small SUV
package<00:00:15.230> it<00:00:15.440> was<00:00:15.620> actually<00:00:15.950> kind<00:00:16.099> of<00:00:16.130> a<00:00:16.220> lot<00:00:16.340> of

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
package it was actually kind of a lot of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.790 
package it was actually kind of a lot of
fun<00:00:16.610> to<00:00:16.760> drive<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.240> based<00:00:17.869> off<00:00:18.080> of<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.470> Audi

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
fun to drive it's based off of the Audi

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.339 
fun to drive it's based off of the Audi
a4<00:00:19.490> architecture<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:20.779> it's<00:00:20.930> kind<00:00:21.140> of<00:00:21.170> like<00:00:21.290> a

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
a4 architecture so it's kind of like a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.940 
a4 architecture so it's kind of like a
lifted<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:21.980> for<00:00:22.360> this<00:00:23.360> particular<00:00:23.689> version<00:00:24.020> has

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
lifted a for this particular version has

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.729 
lifted a for this particular version has
the<00:00:25.430> 2-liter<00:00:25.820> turbo<00:00:26.239> engine<00:00:26.689> it's<00:00:26.840> 211

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
the 2-liter turbo engine it's 211

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.120 
the 2-liter turbo engine it's 211
horsepower<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.730> feels<00:00:29.149> quite<00:00:29.660> peppy<00:00:30.290> it's

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
horsepower and it feels quite peppy it's

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.639 
horsepower and it feels quite peppy it's
uh<00:00:31.310> it<00:00:31.759> feels<00:00:32.419> faster<00:00:32.960> than<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:33.440> you<00:00:33.560> would

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
uh it feels faster than then you would

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:34.900 
uh it feels faster than then you would
think<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.890> would<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.160> only<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.489> an<00:00:34.579> 11

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
think it would with only to an 11

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.490 
think it would with only to an 11
horsepower<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:35.300> think<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.600> lot<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.079> goes<00:00:36.290> to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
horsepower I think a lot of that goes to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.310 
horsepower I think a lot of that goes to
the<00:00:36.530> 8-speed<00:00:37.430> transmission<00:00:38.230> even<00:00:39.230> though

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
the 8-speed transmission even though

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.530 
the 8-speed transmission even though
this<00:00:39.470> car<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:39.890> all-wheel<00:00:40.040> drive<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.420> has

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
this car is all-wheel drive and it has

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.390 
this car is all-wheel drive and it has
the<00:00:41.690> 4-cylinder<00:00:42.230> turbo<00:00:42.560> the<00:00:43.010> 8-speed

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
the 4-cylinder turbo the 8-speed

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.950 
the 4-cylinder turbo the 8-speed
transmission<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.300> fuel<00:00:44.480> efficiency<00:00:44.570> of

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
transmission and the fuel efficiency of

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.230 
transmission and the fuel efficiency of
the<00:00:45.080> turbo<00:00:45.380> give<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:45.740> thing<00:00:45.980> 20<00:00:46.970> miles<00:00:47.120> per

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
the turbo give this thing 20 miles per

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.750 
the turbo give this thing 20 miles per
gallon<00:00:47.600> city<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.020> 27<00:00:48.890> miles<00:00:49.070> per<00:00:49.280> gallon<00:00:49.610> on

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
gallon city and 27 miles per gallon on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.950 
gallon city and 27 miles per gallon on
the<00:00:50.390> freeway

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
the freeway

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.020 
the freeway
the<00:00:51.170> interior<00:00:51.560> is<00:00:51.590> brains<00:00:51.860> expect<00:00:52.250> a<00:00:52.490> lot<00:00:52.910> what

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
the interior is brains expect a lot what

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.970 
the interior is brains expect a lot what
do<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.150> expect<00:00:53.420> from<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.750> Audi<00:00:53.900> maybe<00:00:54.710> not

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
do you expect from the Audi maybe not

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.980 
do you expect from the Audi maybe not
quite<00:00:55.250> as<00:00:55.520> much<00:00:55.730> technology<00:00:56.120> as<00:00:56.630> some<00:00:56.810> of<00:00:56.930> the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
quite as much technology as some of the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.180 
quite as much technology as some of the
cars<00:00:57.200> that<00:00:57.290> are<00:00:57.410> just<00:00:57.710> hitting<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.040> auto

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
cars that are just hitting the auto

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.760 
cars that are just hitting the auto
shows<00:00:58.460> now<00:00:58.700> some<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.210> 2011<00:00:59.810> Show<00:00:59.960> 2012

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
like maybe the Lexus that we saw

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.760 
like maybe the Lexus that we saw
recently<00:01:03.620> but<00:01:04.390> this<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.020> was<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.229> fun<00:01:06.530> car<00:01:06.740> to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
recently but this this was a fun car to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.100 
recently but this this was a fun car to
drive<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.130> fun<00:01:07.490> little<00:01:07.790> truck<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.119> drive<00:01:08.270> it's

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
drive a fun little truck to drive it's

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.349 
drive a fun little truck to drive it's
priced<00:01:09.470> out<00:01:09.650> like<00:01:09.850> 41,000<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:10.969> change<00:01:11.179> I

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
priced out like 41,000 and change I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.719 
priced out like 41,000 and change I

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.020 

power<00:01:33.049> gate<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:34.689> we're<00:01:35.689> lazy<00:01:36.939> storage<00:01:37.939> in

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
power gate because we're lazy storage in

there's you know if you're looking at an

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.969 
there's you know if you're looking at an
Audi<00:01:41.509> a4<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.170> want<00:01:42.320> something<00:01:42.500> small<00:01:42.830> but

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
Audi a4 and you want something small but

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.440 
Audi a4 and you want something small but
you<00:01:43.040> want<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.220> little<00:01:43.250> more<00:01:43.430> storage<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:44.390> is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you want a little more storage this is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.149 
you want a little more storage this is
kind<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> neat<00:01:44.960> because<00:01:45.080> all<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.740> seats<00:01:45.950> fall

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
kind of neat because all the seats fall

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.010 
kind of neat because all the seats fall
down<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.939> front<00:01:47.210> seat<00:01:47.479> folds<00:01:47.869> down

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
pretty much flat as well so you can

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.980 
pretty much flat as well so you can
actually<00:01:49.820> put<00:01:50.149> something<00:01:50.420> really<00:01:50.570> long<00:01:50.840> and

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
actually put something really long and
