00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi everyone today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.070
 I would like to start a taki plane that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 fly very well you'll see it's 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.680
 300 so for a start we take a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.560
 normal size sheet to 4 we go then 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.390
 like that on a precious help to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 algae 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 this is not me you bend your 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.320
 sense of length graffeuil here is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.099
 do not hesitate it's resting this would 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.019
 too fast 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.990
 if you are not ashamed we are 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.900
 Let's complain, we come here we see 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.970
 like this then we open and then we 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.490
 like those here the edges will be found 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:51.030
 but the middle that's why even the 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:52.620
 edges if you do the same from each other 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.110
 next to chew the same thing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.640
 the other who brought the butter or double 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:05.609
 here we go back the fault 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:11.520
 big time of a poem and we bend like 

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:16.670
 this pushes that here in the middle this is it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.619
 like that workers like this here 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.899
 then we will take about a finger 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.569
 and we're going to bend like this here here he has 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.409
 one was doing right side a finger a 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.409
 premium or source 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.859
 this is a place 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:45.539
 then we bring back the small bonus he was 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:54.139
 led there after we fold in two rounds 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:54.139
 understood all the stakes here 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:08.880
 11 and that's it and that's the edge we're going to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.830
 place but decide so here's me 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.830
 that night between us it's there me 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.830
 find this edge where their little ones 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.420
 it's almost done then we'll do it again 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.290
 the cloud again this edge there one 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 will put it back 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:43.830
 here we are and we do the same thing 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:46.920
 the other side tonight where isaac and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.860
 here we are then reviewed my 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.860
 paper here at roy
