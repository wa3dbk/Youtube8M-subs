looked it up and I found out that the
whole<00:01:55.229> lock<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.950> conversation<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
whole lock on that conversation so I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.789 
whole lock on that conversation so I
decided<00:01:57.450> today<00:01:57.630> let<00:01:58.049> me<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.259> dumb<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:58.740> my

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
decided today let me just dumb down my

decided today let me just dumb down my
internet<00:01:59.520> to<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:00.659> class<00:02:00.899> per<00:02:01.079> second<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
internet to to my class per second and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
turnaround and I know that it's not a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.150 
turnaround and I know that it's not a
fix<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.090> basically<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.590> joining<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
fix it's basically you know joining the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.040 
fix it's basically you know joining the
other<00:02:11.310> side<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.090> can't<00:02:12.720> beat<00:02:12.900> them<00:02:12.989> join
