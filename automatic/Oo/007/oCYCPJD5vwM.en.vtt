00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hey. 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.086
 This time I want to present a device combining modernity with old solutions existing for years. 

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:27.686
 Here is the GALAXY Note 10.1 tablet that combines multitasking of a computer with the option of 

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:30.633
 writing like a pen. 

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:32.980
 Focus for a moment because it is on what. 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.626
 GALAXY Note 10.1 GT-N8010 model, which we will talk about, 

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:43.460
 equipped with a Quadcore processor, connected to a quad-core, efficient system. 

00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:51.786
 The memory capacity is 2 GB, and 16 GB of Flash memory allows you to store a large amount of data. 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.820
 Added to this is the support of wireless WLAN and Bluetooth connections as well as GPS and finally a compass. 

00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:01.833
 The device obviously looks very pleasing to the eye. 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.720
 It weighs less than six hundred grams and its size is small at 10.1 inches. 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.573
 The touch screen supports 16 million colors and has a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels. 

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:20.966
 Traditionally, the matrix is ​​protected by a durable pane under which the PLS screen is located. 

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.120
 What is Pe-eL-eS? 

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:29.926
 The mysterious abbreviations that the producers are faking are not a mystery to me. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.493
 Pe-eL-eS is short for Plane-to-Line Switching, 

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:38.813
 ie Samsung technology developed specifically for monitors and tablets. 

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:45.740
 To simplify it, we owe it to a wide viewing angle, high contrast or saturated colors. 

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:51.126
 Let's check what else does Galaxy Note 10.1 hide? 

00:01:51.913 --> 00:01:56.173
 On its lower edge there is a microphone and a multifunctional socket, 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.980
 serving, among others for charging and communication with a computer. 

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:03.560
 On the upper edge there are two buttons. 

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:09.633
 One is used to adjust the volume, and the other to turn the device on or off or block. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.820
 On the same edge you can also find a memory card port, 3.5 mm headphone connector 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.100
 and an infrared LED that allows you to change the tablet into a remote control. 

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:29.213
 This is not a mistake. Galaxy Note 10.1 has been equipped with an infrared transmitter. 

00:02:29.693 --> 00:02:36.380
 Using the included software, you can turn it into a remote control that supports the TV, 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.420
 Blue-Ray player or home theater - basically any brand. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.813
 However, let's go back to the description of the device. 

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:47.926
 On both sides of the screen there are loudspeakers whose location is well thought out, 

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.886
 because they are in such a place that we do not cover them with the device. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.166
 On the front of the GALAXY Note 10.1, over the touch screen, placed on the right 

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:03.413
 - front camera lens, and left sensor lighting affecting its performance. 

00:03:03.926 --> 00:03:09.400
 In turn on the back at the top we find a lens next to which the flashlight was placed. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.233
 On the left side of the rear wall of the device, under the casing, there is an internal antenna. 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.573
 Finally, in the lower right corner there is a cove where the S Pen electronic pen is hidden. 

00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:25.973
 This is the fruit of cooperation between Samsung and Wacom 

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:31.793
 allows the user to use advanced functions of writing, drawing and graphics processing. 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:40.386
 Together with the GALAXY Note 10.1 tablet, we get good quality in-ear headphones with a set of additional elastics, 

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:46.126
 two-part power supply with a USB cable and replaceable stylus for the pen. 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.173
 We've told you how different device is the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. 

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:58.160
 It combines an interesting design with a good hardware, but has many other functionalities. 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.433
 For example, with a stylus or operating system of Android 4.0. 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.126
 At the very bottom of the screen, just above the Samsung sign, 

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:10.486
 there is a small arrow on the black system bar. 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.700
 After touching the user's eyes an additional bar with handheld mini-applications appears. 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.573
 Of course, you can fully configure it by simply touching the edit button that appears in the bottom right corner. 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.120
 It is worth adding that you can run several applications that appear on the screen in a reduced version. 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.073
 By touching them, we switch between them, simultaneously seeing what is happening next to them. 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.566
 While pressing the arrow placed in the upper right corner of the mini-application, we start the full-screen mode. 

00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:46.706
 This is not the end of curiosities. 

00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:52.826
 On Galaxy Note 10.1 you can work like a computer on the so-called split screen. 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.193
 Let's open a web browser. 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.780
 If you want to quickly move some text to the notepad, 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.973
 just click the Multiple screens button in the upper right corner - and now ... 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.946
 The operating system will put two applications side by side, between which we can easily switch between. 

00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:16.473
 Perhaps you will be surprised by the smoothness of the tablet in the large-screen mode 

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:18.473
 - I was very surprised myself. 

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:23.160
 Much more, however, surprised me the action ... the stylus. 

00:05:23.846 --> 00:05:26.940
 Exactly, the mentioned S Pen obviously changes a lot. 

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:32.100
 It can be used to draw and write on the screen like on a piece of paper. 

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:33.286
 But not only. 

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:37.526
 Already removing the stylus from the housing, we stimulate the tablet to "think". 

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:43.173
 - applications well cooperating with it appear on the right side - for example Note S. 

00:05:44.313 --> 00:05:50.566
 And thanks to this program and the stylus, the tablet can be an invaluable scientific aid. 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.653
 All you have to do is select the formula matching function in the application. 

00:05:54.653 --> 00:05:58.480
 Using a stylus, manually enter the selected mathematical operation, 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.453
 even 2 + 6 * 3 + root from 16 + 3 to the power of 4. 

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:09.266
 On the darker part of the screen the text action will be changed by the program. 

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:13.693
 Then click the search option - it's right next to the right. 

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:19.886
 Thanks to the WolframAlph service and the online connection, we will get a result on a split screen. 

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:24.446
 It is also worth mentioning that a few matching icons 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.913
 it also allows you to convert freehand circles, squares and other geometric shapes into vector versions. 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.033
 It is a pity that I was not allowed to use this device during my studies or in high school. 

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:41.833
 Fortunately, now it can also be useful to me, not only to use multimedia or browse the web. 

00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:47.926
 Writing, editing texts or photos is much easier with the stylus. 

00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:52.440
 The device has many advantages of hardware and software. 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.233
 And the icing on the cake is the fact that the purchaser tablet Galaxy Note 10.1 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:05.660
 receives an account on the 50 GB Dropbox service for data storage. 

00:07:06.173 --> 00:07:10.993
 In this cloud you can store all the sketches and photos you create. 

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:15.573
 And I'm saying goodbye to you, and I invite you to visit our website.
