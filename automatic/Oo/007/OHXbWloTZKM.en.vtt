00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.579
 here on the right in pills we always stick to a current theme at 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.539
 jurisprudence for you 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.789
 see only 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.220
 the stj 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 the ditch 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.369
 nilmar doctrine 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.689
 from who 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 a defendant acquitted of the crime 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.520
 this does not prevent the civil action of ten actors 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.569
 did not stop the call 

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.870
 following actions is liquidity crisis 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.490
 even absolved from crime 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.889
 it is possible that the victim 

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:46.770
 enter civil action 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.660
 possible 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.990
 who gives up 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.730
 Minister, I did not decide andrighi 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 there stj it was decided on respect one million one hundred and seventeen 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.800
 in 1807 131 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.550
 see the next topic 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.890
 a crime 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.670
 generators pretensions 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.880
 a punitive claim 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 and one pt indemnification allowance 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.630
 both can concurrently 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.160
 because in Brazil the principle of the independence of the authorities 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.930
 and it is possible that in the criminal process 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.530
 the real wishes to be acquitted 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.060
 and even acquitted 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.860
 this does not prevent the action of dissident 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.400
 there in the scope was seen 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.780
 saved 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.610
 three hypotheses 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.630
 in these three hypotheses it is not possible to enter with action followed 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 What are they? 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399
 when in the criminal sentence 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.890
 the judge recognizes 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.400
 the inexistence of crime 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.390
 there was the fact there was no crime 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.439
 when the criminal judge is known 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.050
 that the defendant did not participate in the fact 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.190
 did not participate at all 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.360
 or conditions that do not recognize the different obesity record 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.429
 and even then this one realized points 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.520
 even so 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.839
 still have some exceptions 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.799
 soon 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.709
 none of those three draws 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.039
 criminal acquittal 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.279
 does not prevent it 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.520
 the civil action 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.760
 I eat well 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.459
 ratified 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.800
 the minister on the site also 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.490
 I respect one million 7 17 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.109
 in 3d 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.919
 see in the comments 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.489
 there on the mtg blog 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.159
 the br point
