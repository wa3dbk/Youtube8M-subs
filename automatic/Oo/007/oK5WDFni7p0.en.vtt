stage<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.800> more<00:02:05.070> than<00:02:05.100> twice<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.360> they

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
stage I think more than twice so they

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.649 
stage I think more than twice so they
were<00:02:07.170> all

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
if it works for sticks and stones so

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.020 
if it works for sticks and stones so
i've<00:03:02.170> heard<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.530> xbox<00:03:03.010> industry<00:03:03.370> since<00:03:03.640> before

i've heard on xbox industry since before

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.550 
i've heard on xbox industry since before
sticks<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.569> stones<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.049> tells<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.349> how<00:03:05.440> many

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
sticks and stones it tells you how many

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.979 
sticks and stones it tells you how many
times<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.829> tomahawks<00:03:06.400> or<00:03:06.700> something<00:03:07.120> i'm<00:03:07.690> not

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
times you tomahawks or something i'm not

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.470 
times you tomahawks or something i'm not
sure<00:03:08.049> if<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.410> change<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.700> i<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:10.180> know<00:03:10.450> a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
sure if we change that but i do know a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.180 
sure if we change that but i do know a
change<00:03:10.720> gun<00:03:10.959> game<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.260> I'm<00:03:11.379> assuming<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:12.069> it
