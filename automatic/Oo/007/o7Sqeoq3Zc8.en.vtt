volatility can increase sharply and we
could<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.460> correction<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.250> 2013

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
we believe in general equities will be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.300 
we believe in general equities will be
short-lived<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:35.840> we're<00:01:36.920> continuing<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> see

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this rotation out of US dollars and we

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
this rotation out of US dollars and we

200-day moving average very bearish

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.100 
200-day moving average very bearish
indication<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.730> had<00:01:59.910> a<00:01:59.940> bearish<00:02:00.390> MACD

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.980 
indication and we had a bearish MACD
crossover<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.550> may<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.730> testing<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.420> 79

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
crossover so we may be testing that 79

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.520 
crossover so we may be testing that 79
low<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.620> maybe<00:02:05.160> break<00:02:05.520> through<00:02:05.850> that
