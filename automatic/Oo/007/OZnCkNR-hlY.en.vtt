00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
Rider character would require a very

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
Rider character would require a very
massive<00:00:37.020> budget<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.559> pull<00:00:37.710> off<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> TV

massive budget to pull off on the TV

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940 
massive budget to pull off on the TV
kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.969> scale<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:39.989> much<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
kind of scale because of how much you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.410 
kind of scale because of how much you
know<00:00:41.040> he's<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> whole<00:00:41.520> flaming<00:00:42.059> effects

know he's got the whole flaming effects
going<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.590> could<00:00:43.739> do

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going on which I think they could do

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
going on which I think they could do
honestly<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:44.610> could<00:00:44.640> put<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> makeup<00:00:45.270> on

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
honestly they could put the makeup on

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
honestly they could put the makeup on
the<00:00:45.629> actor<00:00:45.870> practically<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.890> add<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the actor practically and then add the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
the actor practically and then add the
flames<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> post<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.510> digitally<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.350> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
flames and post like digitally so that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
flames and post like digitally so that's
kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> their<00:00:50.039> they're<00:00:50.460> hesitant<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
kind of their they're hesitant on that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.430 
kind of their they're hesitant on that
Netflix<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:51.960> they're<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
Netflix right now they're kind of a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
Netflix right now they're kind of a
conflict<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> interest<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.120> character

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
conflict of interest with that character

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
conflict of interest with that character
regarding<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> only<00:00:55.440> Ghost<00:00:55.920> Rider<00:00:56.160> but

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
regarding the only Ghost Rider but

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
regarding the only Ghost Rider but
honestly<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
honestly I think that they can do it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
honestly I think that they can do it
just<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.730> flash<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.180> proving

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
just because of how the flash is proving

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
just because of how the flash is proving
that<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.680> cool<00:01:01.949> effects<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that you can do really cool effects on a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.429 
that you can do really cool effects on a
smaller<00:01:02.910> scale<00:01:03.180> budget<00:01:03.660> especially<00:01:03.840> given

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
smaller scale budget especially given

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
smaller scale budget especially given
