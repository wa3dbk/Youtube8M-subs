00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.840
 Hello dear subscribers 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.289
 Today I will show what I will crush in 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.549
 music 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.549
 we will catch now 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.309
 friends plaster form consists of two 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:42.500
 parts 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:45.489
 We try now to fill the camera 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.489
 pins 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.549
 I cover the second part of the nozzle all day 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 lie down 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.539
 I pull the clamp quite a bit 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.350
 because lead expands and can 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:26.959
 form burst in general literally a little bit 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.959
 same as silicone bait 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:49.240
 here we have broken silver and very 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.240
 comfortably like this breadcrumbs 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.930
 close up that did not get to lead it 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.930
 it is desirable to warm the lead well 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:19.340
 wait for a matte shade no changed 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.340
 the color has become a matte color 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.780
 just a few minutes 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.110
 I saw a nice tick how he enjoys 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.040
 for making various 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.080
 immersed bread crumb he tried 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.709
 really very good option 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.520
 idea if all of a sudden you have glaciers 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.840
 and lead numb form better 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.130
 do here such 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:35.880
 breadcrum partitions see 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:40.230
 what happened as we see already 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.920
 adapted there are some nuances mean 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.100
 when the form is well warmed weights 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.560
 almost perfectly smooth 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.959
 there are no cavities and one more 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.680
 the nuance of the lead itself should be good 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.980
 heated then spilled into these narrow 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.980
 channel glasses 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:15.799
 The most important thing is that the gypsum form does not 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:18.199
 got water mold a little 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.209
 chipped off but nonetheless it is not 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.550
 interferes 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:27.590
 quality lead pellet friends 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:31.729
 safety technology i'm on 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:37.669
 open air lead pair and hope 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:41.060
 I do not want to be bullied 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.580
 cast outdoors or when 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.410
 the hood after this I will process 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.130
 files and show you what will be 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.080
 pellets 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.530
 and cut the sprue with a nipper 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.530
 quickly 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:08.469
 Means model model toy is made 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:13.060
 from polymer clay with it is very convenient 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:15.659
 work when baking on has solid 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.080
 base and can handle 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:22.930
 files with emery and paper to achieve 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.050
 gloss and then molded 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.050
 and get a quality form 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.250
 took to try one of the forms 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.250
 the gulf. 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:48.669
 such bullets 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:52.139
 Now I will process the forms practically 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:56.099
 nothing happened the only thing 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:59.800
 I recommend to place all the same away 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:03.460
 Lead means these grains to 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.460
 sprue when monolith pours heavily 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.000
 tsa metal and break out then these here 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.539
 the edges 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.949
 that is, it is better to arrange to arrange 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.819
 away weights to fill 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.819
 singly
