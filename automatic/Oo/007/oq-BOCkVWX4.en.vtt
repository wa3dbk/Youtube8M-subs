00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
also that I really can't use

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.230 
also that I really can't use
polyurethane<00:01:06.859> on<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.299> use<00:01:09.789> filtered<00:01:10.789> walnut

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
polyurethane on so I use filtered walnut

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.560 
polyurethane on so I use filtered walnut
oil

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
oil

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.399 
oil
now<00:01:12.020> filtered<00:01:12.499> walnut<00:01:13.039> oil<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:15.049> took<00:01:15.229> me<00:01:15.350> a

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
now filtered walnut oil it took me a

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.260 
now filtered walnut oil it took me a
long<00:01:15.590> time<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.100> come<00:01:16.249> around<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:16.759> because<00:01:17.240> I

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
long time to come around to because I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.190 
long time to come around to because I
it's<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:17.929> not<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:18.759> prevalent<00:01:19.759> out<00:01:19.850> there

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's just not that prevalent out there

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.569 
it's just not that prevalent out there
in<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.350> field<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:22.659> so<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:24.319> just<00:01:24.890> kind<00:01:25.460> of

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
in the field and so I I just kind of

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.700 
in the field and so I I just kind of
come<00:01:26.149> across<00:01:26.569> a<00:01:26.829> process<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:27.950> elimination

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
come across a process of elimination

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.069 
come across a process of elimination
I've<00:01:30.710> been<00:01:30.889> using<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.369> now<00:01:31.549> for<00:01:32.079> probably

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
I've been using it now for probably

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.550 
I've been using it now for probably
about<00:01:33.679> two<00:01:34.069> and<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.219> half<00:01:34.249> years<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
about two and a half years and the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.279 
about two and a half years and the
reason<00:01:36.859> why<00:01:36.979> I've<00:01:37.189> stuck<00:01:37.579> with<00:01:37.789> it<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.289> because

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
reason why I've stuck with it is because

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.819 
reason why I've stuck with it is because
it<00:01:39.469> brings<00:01:39.950> out<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.490> color<00:01:40.999> of<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.420> wood

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
it brings out the color of the wood

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.699 
it brings out the color of the wood
better<00:01:42.829> than<00:01:43.549> other<00:01:43.819> things<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.499> also

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
better than other things and it also

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.620 
better than other things and it also
dries<00:01:46.310> very<00:01:46.609> hard

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
dries very hard

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.959 
dries very hard
I<00:01:48.009> used<00:01:49.009> distilled<00:01:49.819> walnut<00:01:50.299> oil<00:01:50.450> before<00:01:50.869> I

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
I used distilled walnut oil before I

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.529 
I used distilled walnut oil before I
come<00:01:52.969> across<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.049> filtered<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.030> that

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
come across just the filtered and that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.469 
come across just the filtered and that
worked<00:01:56.780> well<00:01:57.289> but<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.279> doesn't<00:01:58.670> work<00:01:58.819> quite<00:01:59.179> as

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
worked well but it doesn't work quite as

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.639 
worked well but it doesn't work quite as
good<00:01:59.810> as<00:02:00.429> filtered<00:02:01.429> walnut<00:02:01.759> oil<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:03.289> doesn't

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
good as filtered walnut oil it doesn't

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.889 
good as filtered walnut oil it doesn't
bring<00:02:03.770> out<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.130> color<00:02:04.399> quite<00:02:04.999> so<00:02:05.270> much<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.749> it

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
bring out the color quite so much and it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.380 
bring out the color quite so much and it
does<00:02:06.079> not<00:02:06.259> harden<00:02:07.959> quite<00:02:08.959> as<00:02:09.110> much<00:02:09.319> as<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
does not harden quite as much as the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.090 
does not harden quite as much as the
regular<00:02:11.390> filtered<00:02:12.110> walnut<00:02:12.530> oil

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.210 

so<00:02:16.100> anyway<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:18.410> here<00:02:18.740> some<00:02:19.010> vases

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220

so anyway the I have here some vases
that<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.830> use<00:02:22.520> filtered<00:02:23.300> walnut<00:02:23.690> oil<00:02:23.810> on

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that that I use filtered walnut oil on

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.430 
that that I use filtered walnut oil on
like<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.220> Indian<00:02:25.730> rosewood<00:02:26.660> from

Florida it has some really heavy-duty
resin<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.170> put<00:02:33.710> polyurethane

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
resin in it and if you put polyurethane

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.010 
resin in it and if you put polyurethane
on<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.030> it'll<00:02:35.390> turn<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> goo<00:02:36.490> but<00:02:38.020> putting

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
on it it'll turn to a goo but putting

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
the filtered walnut oil on it it makes a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
the filtered walnut oil on it it makes a
nice<00:02:44.300> finish

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.450 
you can even polish it and put a dull
satin<00:02:50.480> finish<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.140> might<00:02:51.320> say<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.310> it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
satin finish on it you might say and it

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.840 
satin finish on it you might say and it
holds<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:54.050> it's<00:02:54.290> good<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
holds it so it's it's good for that the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.920 
holds it so it's it's good for that the
other<00:02:56.000> thing<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.510> course<00:02:56.960> is<00:02:57.250> bowls<00:02:58.930> this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
other thing is of course is bowls this

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.260 
other thing is of course is bowls this
is<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.340> big<00:03:01.340> leaf<00:03:01.520> maple<00:03:01.760> ball<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:05.030> just

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.360 

I've<00:03:08.270> got<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:09.020> two<00:03:09.140> coats<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.130> right

I've got just two coats on this right

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.110 
I've got just two coats on this right
now<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:12.110> that's<00:03:12.230> probably<00:03:12.560> all<00:03:12.800> I'll<00:03:13.640> put<00:03:13.970> on

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
now and that's probably all I'll put on

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.120 
now and that's probably all I'll put on
it<00:03:14.350> ready<00:03:15.350> for<00:03:15.620> use

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
here's one a very small bowl I just took

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.050 
here's one a very small bowl I just took
off<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.480> lathe<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.640> because<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.730> wanted<00:03:23.000> to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
off the lathe and because I wanted to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.490 
off the lathe and because I wanted to
show<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.730> effect<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
show you the the effect that the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.320 
show you the the effect that the
filtered<00:03:28.220> walnut<00:03:28.610> oil<00:03:28.730> has<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.540> on<00:03:29.990> a<00:03:30.709> piece<00:03:31.330> in

bringing out the color and just making

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.949

it a a pretty piece of wood whether I

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.760 
it a a pretty piece of wood whether I
put<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:46.430> first<00:03:46.670> coat<00:03:47.200> or<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:49.750> take

put this on the first coat or I take

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.880 
put this on the first coat or I take
bowls<00:03:51.770> out<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.280> kitchen<00:03:53.410> or<00:03:54.410> whatever

else I might take out of the kitchen to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.970 
else I might take out of the kitchen to
put<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:57.320> little<00:03:58.040> more<00:03:58.310> oil<00:03:58.610> on<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.780> do<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.830> with<00:04:00.950> my

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
put a little more oil on I do it with my

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.470 
put a little more oil on I do it with my
hands<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:02.480> that's<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:03.730> because<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:05.180> want<00:04:05.420> to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
hands and that's just because I want to

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
be able to feel any dry areas that might

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.979 
be able to feel any dry areas that might
be<00:04:09.470> there<00:04:09.739> that<00:04:10.060> would<00:04:11.060> be<00:04:11.209> for<00:04:11.450> bigger<00:04:11.660> bowls

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989

be there that would be for bigger bowls
and<00:04:12.350> bigger<00:04:12.680> pieces<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.370> course

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and bigger pieces of course

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.770 
and bigger pieces of course
this<00:04:15.690> little<00:04:15.930> tiny<00:04:16.170> guy<00:04:16.500> here<00:04:17.270> he<00:04:18.270> will<00:04:18.540> be<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
this little tiny guy here he will be a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.000 
this little tiny guy here he will be a
nice<00:04:19.320> M&amp;M<00:04:19.950> bowl<00:04:20.220> or<00:04:20.550> a<00:04:21.050> nut<00:04:22.050> bowl<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.500> some<00:04:22.740> kind

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
nice M&amp;M bowl or a nut bowl of some kind

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.230 
nice M&amp;M bowl or a nut bowl of some kind
but<00:04:23.700> anyway<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:25.160> put<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.490> saturate<00:04:27.120> it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
but anyway I put it on I saturate it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.520 
but anyway I put it on I saturate it
pretty<00:04:27.570> good<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:29.640> if<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.530> multiple

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
pretty good and if I have multiple

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.490 
pretty good and if I have multiple
pieces<00:04:32.460> going<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.810> course<00:04:34.080> put<00:04:34.260> them<00:04:34.380> inside

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
pieces going I of course put them inside

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.920 
pieces going I of course put them inside
each<00:04:34.890> other<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.310> I'll<00:04:35.850> let<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.060> sit<00:04:36.420> for<00:04:36.450> a

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
each other and I'll let it sit for a

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.120 
each other and I'll let it sit for a
while<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:39.270> only<00:04:39.510> thing<00:04:39.870> about<00:04:40.020> letting<00:04:40.860> this

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
while the only thing about letting this

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.870 
while the only thing about letting this
oil<00:04:41.490> sit<00:04:41.970> too<00:04:42.210> long<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.950> let<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.190> dry<00:04:44.580> on

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
oil sit too long is if you let it dry on

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.710 
oil sit too long is if you let it dry on
on<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.900> surface<00:04:46.550> it's<00:04:47.550> going<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.880> be<00:04:48.000> hard<00:04:48.570> to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
on the surface it's going to be hard to

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.010 
on the surface it's going to be hard to
get<00:04:48.900> off<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.220> can<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:50.610> put<00:04:51.540> some<00:04:51.750> more

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
get off but you can just put some more

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.910 
get off but you can just put some more
on

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
on

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.940 
on
and<00:04:53.490> it'll<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.350> can<00:04:55.500> rub<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.740> off

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
and it'll you can you can rub it off

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.280 
and it'll you can you can rub it off
then<00:04:56.960> it's<00:04:59.060> good<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.240> let<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.540> set<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:00.990> course

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
then it's good to let it set of course

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.920 
then it's good to let it set of course
to<00:05:03.560> go<00:05:04.560> over<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.860> dry<00:05:05.070> spots<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.420> make

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
to go over the dry spots and and make

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.900 
to go over the dry spots and and make
sure<00:05:07.140> everything<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:07.710> has<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.670> good

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
sure everything is has a good

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.120 
sure everything is has a good
penetration<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:11.300> but<00:05:12.300> it's<00:05:12.800> also<00:05:13.800> very

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
penetration to it but it's also very

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.620 
penetration to it but it's also very
important<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.500> take<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.680> oil<00:05:17.040> off<00:05:17.540> before<00:05:18.540> it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
important to take this oil off before it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.440 
important to take this oil off before it
does<00:05:18.870> dry<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:21.830> sooner<00:05:22.830> than<00:05:23.040> later<00:05:23.730> is<00:05:24.030> better

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
does dry and sooner than later is better

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.500 
does dry and sooner than later is better
because<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:26.070> does<00:05:26.340> make<00:05:26.550> for<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.970> rough<00:05:27.210> surface

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
because it does make for a rough surface

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.930 
because it does make for a rough surface
if<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.020> dries<00:05:28.260> on<00:05:28.500> there<00:05:28.680> because<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.160> it<00:05:29.670> turns

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
if it dries on there because it it turns

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.280 
if it dries on there because it it turns
hard<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.170> want<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.500> take<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.800> off<00:05:33.020> as<00:05:34.020> much

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
hard so you want to take it off as much
