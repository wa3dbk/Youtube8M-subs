a<00:03:15.459> little<00:03:15.670> bit<00:03:15.910> when<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.239> dries<00:03:16.480> out<00:03:16.660> see<00:03:17.170> that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
a little bit when it dries out see that

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.110 
a little bit when it dries out see that
would<00:03:17.590> be<00:03:17.739> good<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.520> see<00:03:18.670> this<00:03:18.790> will<00:03:19.000> be

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
would be good this you see this will be

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.910 
would be good this you see this will be
this<00:03:19.840> over<00:03:20.140> here's<00:03:20.350> what<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.590> looks<00:03:20.769> like

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
this over here's what it looks like

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.789 
this over here's what it looks like
after<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.370> starts<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.730> dry<00:03:21.940> out<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:23.650> almost

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
after it starts to dry out so it almost

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.520 
after it starts to dry out so it almost
looks<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.280> alona<00:03:24.840> all<00:03:25.840> right<00:03:26.019> well<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> trip

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
looks like alona all right well the trip

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.820 
looks like alona all right well the trip
to<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.860> sawmill<00:03:27.670> was<00:03:27.850> fruitful<00:03:28.600> no<00:03:29.320> walnut

I have a project for so identifying one
species<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.380> can<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.799> kind<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.070> tricky<00:04:18.280> and

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
species that can be kind of tricky and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.319 
species that can be kind of tricky and
there<00:04:18.760> are<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:18.970> lot<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.600> them<00:04:19.840> out

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329
