far it's pretty cool I mean it makes

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.880 
far it's pretty cool I mean it makes
everything<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.529> lot<00:00:16.650> simpler<00:00:18.710> but<00:00:21.769> you<00:00:22.769> know

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
everything a lot simpler but you know

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.189 
everything a lot simpler but you know
that<00:00:23.100> they've<00:00:23.369> they've<00:00:24.300> upgraded<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.930> ton<00:00:25.170> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that they've they've upgraded a ton of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.720 
that they've they've upgraded a ton of
stuff<00:00:25.560> whether<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.189> windows<00:00:26.550> mobile

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
stuff whether they get windows mobile

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.730 
stuff whether they get windows mobile
6.1<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.119> even<00:00:30.449> put<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> Opera<00:00:31.560> web

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
6.1 and they even put in the Opera web

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.780 
6.1 and they even put in the Opera web
browser<00:00:33.380> which<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.250> powerful<00:00:35.430> web

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
browser which is really powerful web

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
browser which is really powerful web
browser<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.710> does<00:00:37.710> flash<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
browser that does flash and all that so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
browser that does flash and all that so
you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.930> YouTube<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.590> something

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
you can go to like YouTube or something

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.020 
you can go to like YouTube or something
and<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.280> watch<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> video<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and actually watch the video as in the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.319 
and actually watch the video as in the
flash<00:00:45.270> player<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.550> thing<00:00:47.760> might<00:00:47.969> end<00:00:48.210> up

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
flash player so this thing might end up

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
flash player so this thing might end up
taking<00:00:48.840> down<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> iPod<00:00:49.739> pretty<00:00:50.489> fast<00:00:52.219> even

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
even got a slide-out keyboard in this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
even got a slide-out keyboard in this
thing<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.189> doesn't<00:01:29.460> tilt<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
thing it doesn't tilt it up like the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.990 
thing it doesn't tilt it up like the
AT&amp;T<00:01:30.479> tail<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.259> used<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:32.000> but

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
AT&amp;T tail it like I used to have but

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.469 
AT&amp;T tail it like I used to have but
that<00:01:33.750> made<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> weak<00:01:34.560> anyway<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that made it kind of weak anyway so this

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530 
that made it kind of weak anyway so this
one's<00:01:36.689> probably<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.350> stronger<00:01:38.540> one

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
one's probably a little bit stronger one

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.080 
one's probably a little bit stronger one
of<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.720> favorite<00:01:40.229> visual<00:01:41.130> features<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> is
