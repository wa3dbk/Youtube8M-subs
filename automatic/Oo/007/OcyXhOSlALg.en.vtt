00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.419 
really believe that your night economy
and<00:02:05.600> United<00:02:06.600> Asian<00:02:06.840> any<00:02:06.960> cap<00:02:07.170> minus<00:02:07.409> one<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and United Asian any cap minus one the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.699 
and United Asian any cap minus one the
it's<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.479> safe<00:02:09.660> back<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.080> my<00:02:10.200> opinion<00:02:10.470> it's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it's a safe back in my opinion it's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's a safe back in my opinion it's
based<00:02:10.950> around<00:02:11.039> 2.2<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.720> they<00:02:12.930> win<00:02:13.140> by<00:02:13.290> one

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
based around 2.2 and if they win by one

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.119 
based around 2.2 and if they win by one
it's<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.700> bit<00:02:14.909> survived<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:15.769> if<00:02:16.769> they<00:02:16.950> win

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
it's it's a bit survived but if they win

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.770 
it's it's a bit survived but if they win
vital<00:02:17.430> world<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.909> win<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.599> that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
vital world it's a win and I think that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.690 
vital world it's a win and I think that
is<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.319> best<00:02:19.560> trying<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> play<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
is the best trying to play it here and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.720 
is the best trying to play it here and
it's<00:02:20.849> our<00:02:21.150> top<00:02:21.540> team<00:02:21.780> talking<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:22.860> all<00:02:23.519> right

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.599 
burst is definitely the best choice but
I<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:46.230> fungal<00:02:46.560> gonna<00:02:46.769> give<00:02:47.010> more<00:02:47.190> minions<00:02:47.549> to
