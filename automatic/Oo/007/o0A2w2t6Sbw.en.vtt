millimeters<00:05:15.710> thick<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:18.910> would<00:05:19.910> go<00:05:20.030> 3

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
millimeters thick I would go 3

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.040 
millimeters thick I would go 3
millimeters<00:05:22.570> overall<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:26.510> handle<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:26.930> just

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
millimeters overall the handle is just

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.770 
millimeters overall the handle is just
enough<00:05:27.590> for<00:05:27.620> my<00:05:27.889> hand<00:05:28.180> it's<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.330> bit<00:05:29.479> on<00:05:29.630> the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
enough for my hand it's a bit on the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.610 
enough for my hand it's a bit on the
small<00:05:30.260> side<00:05:30.410> however<00:05:32.110> let's<00:05:33.110> measure<00:05:33.349> it<00:05:33.560> out

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
small side however let's measure it out

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:41.560 
small side however let's measure it out
really<00:05:33.860> quick<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.800> we<00:05:39.949> got<00:05:40.130> 12<00:05:41.030> here<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.510> I'm

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
really quick so we got 12 here and I'm

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.240 
really quick so we got 12 here and I'm
guessing<00:05:41.900> there's<00:05:42.050> another<00:05:42.320> hinge<00:05:42.620> here<00:05:42.830> so

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
guessing there's another hinge here so

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.279 
guessing there's another hinge here so
that<00:05:44.150> makes<00:05:44.360> about<00:05:45.199> 13<00:05:45.650> inches<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:47.169> don't<00:05:48.169> know

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
that makes about 13 inches I don't know

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.870 
that makes about 13 inches I don't know
I<00:05:48.830> don't<00:05:49.639> know<00:05:49.789> if<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.000> listing<00:05:51.460> said<00:05:52.460> 15

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
I don't know if the listing said 15

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.430 
I don't know if the listing said 15
inches<00:05:53.150> or<00:05:53.360> if<00:05:53.449> I'm<00:05:53.690> like<00:05:53.930> tripping<00:05:54.320> on
