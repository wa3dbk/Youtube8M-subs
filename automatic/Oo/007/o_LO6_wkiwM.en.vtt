00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
show you this now basically what he's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.370 
show you this now basically what he's
going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.270> instead<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.660> taking<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.110> main

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
going to do instead of taking the main

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.990 
going to do instead of taking the main
road<00:02:19.650> he's<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.310> cut<00:02:20.670> through<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
road he's just going to cut through the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.550 
road he's just going to cut through the
hills<00:02:21.270> now<00:02:21.630> there's<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.020> hill<00:02:22.260> range

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
hills now there's like a hill range

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.140 
hills now there's like a hill range
wouldn't<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.280> call<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.640> mountain<00:02:24.000> range

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
wouldn't really call it a mountain range

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.400 
wouldn't really call it a mountain range
because<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:24.780> large<00:02:24.990> enough<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.290> be

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
because it's not large enough to be

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.140 
because it's not large enough to be
mountains<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.370> instead<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.120> straight

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
mountains but instead of going straight

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.600 
mountains but instead of going straight
down<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.750> road<00:02:28.020> he<00:02:28.260> goes<00:02:28.440> ahead<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.069> he<00:02:29.280> veers

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
down this road he goes ahead in he veers

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.699 
down this road he goes ahead in he veers
off<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> left<00:02:30.360> over<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.230> he<00:02:31.470> crosses

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
off to the left over here and he crosses

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.320 
off to the left over here and he crosses
over<00:02:32.010> these<00:02:32.220> train<00:02:32.489> tracks<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.850> he<00:02:32.970> basically

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
over these train tracks and he basically

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.050 
over these train tracks and he basically
heads<00:02:33.690> towards<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> yellow<00:02:34.800> dot<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.730> he's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
heads towards the yellow dot so he's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
heads towards the yellow dot so he's
basically<00:02:36.450> cutting<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.650> half<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.900> lot

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
basically cutting it in half it's a lot

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.020 
basically cutting it in half it's a lot
easier<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.830> way<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.100> guys<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.940> I

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
easier this way to guys because like I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.750 
easier this way to guys because like I
said<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.840> guys<00:02:43.050> over<00:02:43.380> there<00:02:43.709> are<00:02:43.980> really

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
said the guys over there are really

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.060 
said the guys over there are really
really<00:02:45.330> hard<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.720> kill<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.830> thing<00:02:47.040> about

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
really hard to kill and the thing about

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.670 
really hard to kill and the thing about
them<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.690> they<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.750> shoot<00:02:49.140> through<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.470> RV

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
very easily the RV is really not armored
