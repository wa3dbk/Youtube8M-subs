00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.210
 health friends and our program 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.590
 continues and I invite you again 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.500
 look inside the human body 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.770
 we want to tell you about the unique 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 survey method is called 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 computed tomography and I transmit 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.099
 word to our correspondent your emotion 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.970
 Well, they are ready to look inside 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.810
 today will tell you about 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.290
 computed tomography but first game 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.210
 there is a diamond in hell of these sausages 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.690
 worth $ 5 million 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.850
 don't ask how he got there like us 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.840
 you can find him cut every sausage 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.379
 analyze each means and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.070
 maybe there will be a diamond but what if 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.989
 this is not a diamond and the disease is not a sausage 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.520
 man still cut no said 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.519
 wilhelm x-ray in 1895 and made 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.060
 first x-ray 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.390
 for 1 x-ray wilhelm 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.670
 x-ray got the first in the world 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.450
 Nobel Prize in Physics and already through 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.450
 year 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.719
 chest x-ray becoming commonplace 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.299
 research in all hospitals of the world we 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.750
 also decided to make an x-ray of 3 loaves 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.020
 sausages and saw that in the sausage carnations 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.509
 they are diamond but maybe diamond is hiding 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.149
 over the chest unfortunately on a flat 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.380
 x-ray this is not visible so 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.829
 X-ray flat 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.799
 two-dimensional she can be seen three-dimensional 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:51.849
 picture see the focus in her right hand she 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.849
 turn off the light in our left hand banana 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.350
 look only at my shadow 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.780
 so you do not see that I have pineapple 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.740
 On those not visible only banana so 90 have 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.649
 i have pineapple 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.310
 now I can't see a banana to see and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.760
 banana pineapple i have to spin around 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.030
 yourself and isn't it easier to do so 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.290
 the x-ray machine rotated 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.470
 around the patient this is the whole point 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.239
 computed tomography and so 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:37.670
 CT scan will be done right 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:38.569
 let me class there my diamond inside 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.880
 tomograph 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.700
 x-ray tube is located during 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.750
 survey device revolves around 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.450
 human with tremendous speed and makes 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.349
 thousand flat x-rays in 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.920
 second computer analyzes them and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.560
 creates a three-dimensional image 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.390
 human body 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.160
 which bodies see best 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.880
 CT scanner like this pictures 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.270
 in kenshi and possible survey 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.730
 all organ systems but with gold 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.600
 the standard is organ research 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.920
 chest 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.090
 because here we get thin 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.020
 slices we see the bronchi we see the vessels in 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.700
 light but now all the same let's 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.910
 do if it is not as it should be without 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.640
 sausages without diamonds and estimate 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.120
 the state of the organs of large cells since 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.120
 it is necessary 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:51.140
 the study lasted only five minutes 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.140
 that's happiness 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.020
 cycle she returns the sausage 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.389
 diamond found then trust but 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.969
 check 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:11.450
 Svetlana's money is little familiar 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:18.530
 what happened to my diamond 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.530
 check it like this is a nail 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.870
 there is no diamond just a nail 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.780
 well and Stalin sausage alone 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.830
 let's talk about our study 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.810
 How much do you know from the inside ? 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.819
 here is your rib cage so across and 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.949
 at the side 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:50.240
 everything went well you have lungs young 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.669
 a healthy non-smoker is the time 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.099
 so thank you very much galina edward out 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.430
 and we told you by computer 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.979
 tomography method which allows 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.590
 absolutely everything found inside a person so 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.050
 that don't hide there no diamonds don't 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.349
 anything else it was a program 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.099
 health first channel first grad 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.099
 hospitals
