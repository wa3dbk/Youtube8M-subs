00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.300
 Hi, I'm Angela from the inn and if I'm going 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.210
 to explain how one of the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.840
 essential points in crochet the point 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 or dwarf or also called false point 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.070
 you will see how it is woven how it is closed and 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.859
 how is a sample woven with this 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.320
 point that you see in the image is the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.809
 symbol with which it is usually represented 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.360
 so that regardless of the 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.660
 name with which you find it as well as 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.400
 I'll show you now is how to weave 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.059
 let's start by making a knot 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.010
 sliding 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.850
 for this we take the thread we cross it and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.900
 now for this ring we take out another veis 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.630
 so we already have our sliding knot 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.310
 we introduce the needle 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.829
 and we adjust it 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.909
 A) Yes 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.520
 let's start now knitting 10 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.650
 chains if you do not know how they are made 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 we leave you a video that will help 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.870
 always remember the chains are the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.620
 crochet base to weave any 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.810
 draft 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.600
 when you have your 10 chains 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 we are going to weave an extra 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.970
 is going to simulate the criminal point we go there 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.670
 with the first round 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 the first net chord not in the second 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.170
 we introduce the needle 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.700
 we remove the thread and now we return it to 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.700
 take 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.560
 let's go to the next 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.900
 introduce the needle we take a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.400
 strand 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.400
 and we take it out again 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:06.159
 again we introduce the needle 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:09.729
 we take a thread and we take it out again 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.500
 this point is very dense usually 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.319
 It is not used to weave large 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.629
 surfaces but it is used to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.720
 close turns with the knit without circulating 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.260
 or as part of some reason for 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.260
 crochet 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.160
 we weave 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.160
 Spin 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.939
 at this point 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.370
 and we'd have finished you see is very 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.959
 thick and barely managed to advance as 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.290
 ok let's knit now the next 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.099
 turn we weave a water a chain to the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.620
 start of the spin we turn and now 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.480
 we are going to take reference one of 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.940
 the sides of this chain we have 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.940
 here we introduce the needle 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.709
 and we take a strand 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.709
 and we take it out again 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.130
 we repeat again we introduce the needle 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.840
 we take out the thread and we take it out again 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.600
 As I said, this point is very 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.280
 bushy now in the next round is 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.040
 possible that after a lot of work 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.319
 enter the needle 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.860
 but do not worry, you 'll see how 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.860
 you will get 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.480
 we follow 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.640
 for example this point you can also 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.640
 use if a good one has left you a 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.880
 little bit big you can add one or two 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.270
 dwarf point turns this now that it 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.880
 I adjust it better and you can put it 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.110
 but do not abuse the dwarf point is a 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.940
 very dense and hardly elastic and 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.940
 we have reached the end of the turn 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.850
 and we weave the latter 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.370
 How can you check if you have knitted 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.050
 high point low on two doors 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.000
 we have barely been able to advance 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.990
 vertically 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.880
 let's close we knit the last point 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.290
 dwarf of the turn that if this here 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:27.600
 we take the thread and take it out 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.600
 now we throw like this and cut the thread 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.190
 you see and the last thing left is to throw 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.849
 now would be closed so our 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.580
 sample 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.789
 that's how a sample of 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.110
 dwarf point of twenty points by six 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.569
 turns 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.319
 if you compare this sample with a sample 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.959
 for example high point you will see that in 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.439
 six laps like here we have six 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.099
 turns 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:59.289
 we barely move vertically that's why the 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.899
 Dwarf stitch is not a recommended item 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.689
 to weave large surfaces because 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:07.869
 besides consuming a lot of thread the tissue 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:11.080
 that we have is very thick very thick and 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:13.559
 barely has flexibility and remember if 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.759
 your edges are not rectilinear 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.649
 Do you have any increase or any 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.979
 decrease is because you have had 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.749
 some small mistake to correct it already 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.289
 you know you have to undo until that 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:29.110
 point and recover it unfortunately not 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.529
 there are tricks to recover those 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.749
 mistakes 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.609
 we hope this video has served you 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.009
 of help if you want to continue learning 

00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:38.629

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.979
