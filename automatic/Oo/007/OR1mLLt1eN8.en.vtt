with<00:01:55.630> circus<00:01:55.990> Olay<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:57.490> going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.730> be

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
with circus Olay it's going to be

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.970 
with circus Olay it's going to be
spectacular<00:01:58.200> first<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.320> all<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.560> don't<00:01:59.650> think

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
spectacular first of all I don't think

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.560 
spectacular first of all I don't think
circus<00:02:00.430> Olay<00:02:00.640> has<00:02:00.790> ever<00:02:01.000> done<00:02:01.150> anything<00:02:01.390> that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
circus Olay has ever done anything that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.630 
circus Olay has ever done anything that
isn't<00:02:02.290> less<00:02:02.470> than<00:02:02.650> spectacular<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.370> I<00:02:03.460> think

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
isn't less than spectacular and I think

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.190 
isn't less than spectacular and I think
Xbox<00:02:04.060> hasn't<00:02:04.390> done<00:02:04.480> anything<00:02:04.720> there's<00:02:04.990> less

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
Xbox hasn't done anything there's less

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.630

and<00:02:42.010> actually<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.370> movies<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:43.329> big<00:02:43.870> part<00:02:44.079> of

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and actually in movies is a big part of

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.280 
and actually in movies is a big part of
this<00:02:44.290> kind<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.629> technology<00:02:46.629> I<00:02:46.900> think<00:02:46.989> it's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
this kind of technology I think it's

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.929 
this kind of technology I think it's
amazing<00:02:47.439> what<00:02:48.069> do<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:48.189> think<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.370> Xbox

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939

teaming up with circus Olay well that

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.869 
teaming up with circus Olay well that
seems<00:02:51.159> like<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> perfect<00:02:51.579> combination

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
seems like the perfect combination

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.610 
seems like the perfect combination
because<00:02:52.269> when<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.659> watch<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.019> facility<00:02:53.500> go

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
because when you watch the facility go

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.920 
because when you watch the facility go
are<00:02:53.829> they<00:02:54.010> real<00:02:54.250> are<00:02:54.700> they<00:02:54.849> really<00:02:55.060> good<00:02:55.389> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
are they real are they really good and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:28.630 
are they real are they really good and
they<00:02:56.079> do<00:02:56.139> without<00:02:56.469> control<00:02:56.889> is<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.250> say
