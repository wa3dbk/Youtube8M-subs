00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.670
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.790
 hello and welcome you know 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.279
 what a gps tracker is someone's war 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.880
 tracked there I have a device 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.460
 found 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 that just thrills me from the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.970
 technology because you are on this small 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.980
 room with a complete mobile phone 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 handsfree a gps receiver 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 an electronics evaluation electronics below 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 small controller 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.739
 here is inserted to sim so this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 mobile radio cards this small and then 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 it can log on to the mobile network 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.870
 and I communicate with this part per 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.789
 sms i tell him so what do i want so 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 and what is there now 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 It can, for example, report where he is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 it can report if it is out 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.770
 it comes out in a certain area 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 can sometimes look where it is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.449
 It may be from time to time I had 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.199
 even a name to hear the summer it so 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 can still say something 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.619
 it can settle from time to time messages 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 where it is so to certain 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.729
 schedules and so on 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.500
 and what else does this device have? 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.970
 actually only two buttons here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.549
 below is a usb connection to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.030
 charging the built-in battery and here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.119
 below 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.700
 that an emergency button and this one 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.810
 emergency button is used when I am there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 an emergency call will be sent out 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 with a sms and then somehow 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 someone called and also gets one 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 message 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.409
 and he can call back the device 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.450
 turns out to be too lewd 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.130
 So if you go for a walk in the forest and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.860
 I can not stand it anymore 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 move and better rescuers and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.049
 but I do not find them reliable 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.079
 I thought I am a foreigner 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.909
 they will not do that anyway 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.969
 a lot of high tech because you have to look like that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.210
 Now this is the one up here 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.530
 the gps antenna is not more 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.090
 More to day and complete gps number that 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.210
 normal under the metal shield is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.210
 that on this little board on the 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.550
 board so there is the card connection 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.590
 for this one is for example the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.710
 microphone this little fuzzy part 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.810
 apparatus in front of my thumb and on the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.900
 back there we see on the slope of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.230
 loudspeaker tion so and there is a 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.540
 complete mobile phone installed so 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.670
 Hightech of the finest one thing 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.920
 I'm excited and they should get that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.090
 Let's see life saver in the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.090
 trouser pocket is a great part
