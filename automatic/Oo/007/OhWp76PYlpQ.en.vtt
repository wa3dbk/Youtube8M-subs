see<00:02:08.319> I<00:02:12.550> was<00:02:13.550> very<00:02:13.580> fortunate<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.569> grew<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:14.959> on

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
see I was very fortunate I grew up on

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.920 
see I was very fortunate I grew up on
dolly<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> wasn't<00:02:17.180> until<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.600> went<00:02:17.750> and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
dolly but it wasn't until I went and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.170 
dolly but it wasn't until I went and
rode<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.319> other<00:02:18.470> parts<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.040> world<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:20.150> I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
rode in other parts of the world but I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.240 
rode in other parts of the world but I
really<00:02:20.660> recognize<00:02:21.050> just<00:02:21.470> how<00:02:21.590> special<00:02:21.800> don't

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
really recognize just how special don't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.630 
really recognize just how special don't
worry

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
worry

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.760 
worry
the<00:02:23.180> people<00:02:23.540> are<00:02:23.630> ride<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:24.050> Dartmoor<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.650> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
the people are ride on Dartmoor in the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.850 
the people are ride on Dartmoor in the
main<00:02:24.950> know<00:02:25.190> their<00:02:25.550> patch<00:02:26.030> really<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.020> but<00:02:27.709> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
main know their patch really well but it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.220 
main know their patch really well but it
takes<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.190> long<00:02:28.489> time<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:29.480> research<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.870> whole

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
takes a long time to research the whole

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.660 
takes a long time to research the whole
of<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.530> moon<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.010> join<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.489> up

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
of the moon and to join it all up

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.340 
of the moon and to join it all up
together<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.330> think<00:02:32.750> that's<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
together I think that's one of the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.080 
together I think that's one of the
secrets<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:33.860> Liberty<00:02:34.220> traces<00:02:34.730> we've<00:02:34.910> got<00:02:35.060> a
