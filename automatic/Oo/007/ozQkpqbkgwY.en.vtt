00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.440
 I'll fight for the podium after successfully implanting a supposed implant 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.090
 alien of the land of vip the team performs tests to determine if 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.219
 he still issues unusual warnings as before 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.400
 talk a little about the radiofrequency test 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 the bankruptcy adjuster was simply canceled or for bad 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.829
 the implant is no longer emitting signals I can not tell if it has been 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.740
 off or controlled beach does not work any more 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.880
 frequencies of this type of object imply that there is much more in it than 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.950
 It is possible to see 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.220
 or r7 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.410
 brought a show of which we speak you show people light optical microscope 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 the next step is to analyze the object itself 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.090
 would be something identifiable or simply an object in the world 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.910
 the team lead to shows the anguish of mac are from the civil lab who is the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.410
 second in california 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 with 36 years and experience 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.509
 this is one of the leading independent labs in the united states 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.950
 to make a scientific approach we have to see really useful and this 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.530
 subjecting it to metallurgical and ideological tests 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.490
 and watch closely to see if we have anything the show is too small 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.270
 on Tuesday 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.290
 at least 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.300
 2mm wide what is it that you are looking for at the moment in 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.290
 geometry the shape of coura spectrus texture of the profiles session a good point 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.570
 to start 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.860
 earth appears to have an irregular shape appears to have a black and brown color 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.170
 it seems to be a small meteorite there are fracture lines or no no no 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.820
 does not appear to have been made by the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.050
 about the optical microscope that enlarges 40 times we have a better idea of 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 as he was 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 south 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.839
 the object in two distinct areas 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.279
 a light inner layer and a dark outer layer 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.889
 I saw the outer surface and it seemed to me darkened or burnt by 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.539
 cancer can be done today 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.889
 it may be that sedation I do not know but a closer examination reveals a third 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:28.389
 via 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.039
 a common protrusion of the object 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.290
 it looks like something I get letters 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.979
 cadu as if it were a type of region 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.109
 we call fin 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.469
 It looks like a fin coming out of the thief. I'm curious to know what he did. 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.709
 this is the scanning electron microscope we have a source of 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.489
 media electrons vertically meters for the show we can beat the fox of the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.639
 axles available 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.949
 of ratification of the cajias which will give information on the elements of Ana 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.429
 show 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.429
 it's a very present team 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.900
 we can take an x-ray of the material of this clear fin 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:13.869
 we see here that it is not a would be bc designs of the show in truth 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.779
 It's something that's stuck with it. 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 the spectrum is of organic material then 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:24.769
 some reason we do not 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.920
 the piece of the human body that attached itself to the upper surface of the show 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:34.269
 this is very interesting because the human body has two types of reaction 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.599
 to a foreign object in the most extreme case it would be involved in course and 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.809
 transported out in the second case would be returned and there would be a 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.729
 small inflammatory reaction but here it seems that any material in the body 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:53.089
 really got caught up in the show, which does not seem to me to be one of the 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:55.119
 the poor doctor has described 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:59.459
 usually he would be rejected by the body but it did not happen he he is 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.199
 always very interesting for you seems to be stuck in this show of 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.309
 unusual shape in the 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.559
 the team continues to analyze the object for abnormalities 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.379
 you can get a good idea of ​​what the heavy elements are 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:19.299
 I see iron what it has suggested and it is carbon that suffers 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.710
 as you can see the highest peak and carbon 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.539
 the carbon and oxygen we think were the contaminated ones 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.830
 all of them could be found in body flowers for example but if 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.389
 we will still have this iron offer 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.680
 he looks like iron 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.240
 now we are seeing a third area of ​​the show is not isolated where we found 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.770
 have black coloration 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.909
 due to this the cacoal peaks 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.629
 skirt the result is similar and match to the much easier forum 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.620
 in this area 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.150
 I did not find anything for the time being 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.600
 and like the other states but internally we have a part 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.319
 small and money a 2mm in diameter that is made of iron 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.630
 a physically possible truth that a strange object named it inside the 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.150
 body and Switzerland at points distant from where it entered sometimes years later 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.899
 I work as a scientist is to look at these states should sign something in 

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:19.290
 common 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.980
 and in this case there is still something that surprises me my job is to spoil the 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.980
 their party I'm so sorry to do that again 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.139
 dante believes that the implant is an iron pellet and that its appearance 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.139
 is a natural occurrence 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.999
 we can debate this case all night or even to know if we wanted more 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.099
 fact is that there was a traumatic event in his life in the laboratory we 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.189
 we did ten years and we discovered that 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.739
 at least one test was very strange are seeing there was a human tissue 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.729
 by another still growing from within an invoice of the 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.249
 the object that I was very excited about having the opportunity to promote 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:02.289
 surgically what we thought was a kind of foreign object with an implant 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.650
 alien 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.060
 so the position now after the scientific tests with it seems to be 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.189
 only a fragment of twisted iron 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.720
 not being from Christmas we do not have this technology in the 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.779
 Earth 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.389
 I say it is beyond our technology and that possibly it alien 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.340
 we surrender our technology to apply oncology clearly to be 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.279
 done in this case 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:36.709
 a skeptic will always say that we do not approve the existence of objects as 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:41.459
 if we had decided to move on the table to be true on the other hand 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.120
 the fire will say that it did not revolt at all show me something that says that 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.449
 It is something else and there was no knowing of a thing. 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.740
 we found nothing here neide a presence 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.560
 alien affecting us on planet earth interfering in our life heard 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.319
 generated by parents 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:08.310
 which began on a deserted road in 1908 and 1910 61 with a couple supposedly 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:12.179
 pursued day 12 of the current continues until today 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.100
 hundreds of new managers of alien abduction are reported every year 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.220
 but the full description of what happens during adoption can 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.289
 never be known 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.289
 we are even being observed by beings from another world 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:33.020
 it is possible that other beings leave evidence of their visit from our 

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.580
 planet 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.650
 or disturbing stories not the end of the darkness of space but the 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.759
 dark corners and our own imagination
