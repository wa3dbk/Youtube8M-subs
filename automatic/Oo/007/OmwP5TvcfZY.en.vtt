art direction on this it was it was
quite<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.329> bit<00:00:35.480> different<00:00:35.840> because<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.040> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
quite a bit different because the the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.910 
quite a bit different because the the
project<00:00:37.610> was<00:00:37.700> intended<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.239> be<00:00:38.920> specifically

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
project was intended to be specifically

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.610 
project was intended to be specifically
not<00:00:40.579> my<00:00:40.820> style<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.390> specifically<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.500> know

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
not my style and specifically you know

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.569 
not my style and specifically you know
six<00:00:42.980> different<00:00:43.280> anime<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.969> know<00:00:44.090> styles<00:00:45.579> my

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
six different anime you know styles my

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.610 
six different anime you know styles my
involvement<00:00:46.850> was<00:00:47.210> too<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:48.199> was<00:00:48.320> almost<00:00:48.440> more

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
involvement was too it was almost more

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.619 
involvement was too it was almost more
like<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.800> traffic<00:00:49.219> cop<00:00:49.430> than<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:50.030> producer<00:00:50.510> you

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
like a traffic cop than a producer you

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.529 
like a traffic cop than a producer you
know<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:51.020> wasn't<00:00:51.590> like<00:00:52.550> this<00:00:52.579> this<00:00:53.090> project

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
know it wasn't like this this project

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.180 
know it wasn't like this this project
required<00:00:53.870> my<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:54.469> much<00:00:54.649> of<00:00:54.770> my<00:00:54.890> creative

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
required my as much of my creative

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.240 
required my as much of my creative
involvement<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:56.570> was<00:00:56.899> still<00:00:57.109> asked<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.129> give

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
involvement I was still asked to give

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.069 
involvement I was still asked to give
notes<00:00:58.579> but<00:00:59.180> it<00:00:59.269> was<00:00:59.359> very<00:00:59.570> I<00:00:59.690> found<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.989> very

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
notes but it was very I found it very

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.360 
notes but it was very I found it very
difficult<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.500> give<00:01:00.649> notes<00:01:00.890> on<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.100> project

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
difficult to give notes on this project

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.570 
difficult to give notes on this project
because<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:02.750> know<00:01:02.920> if<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.070> give<00:01:04.250> no<00:01:04.370> sin

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
because you know if I give no sin

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.100 
because you know if I give no sin
suddenly<00:01:04.880> it<00:01:04.940> becomes<00:01:05.150> my<00:01:05.420> point<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:05.810> view<00:01:05.840> you

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
suddenly it becomes my point of view you

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.170 
suddenly it becomes my point of view you
know<00:01:06.230> and<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.860> point<00:01:07.100> was<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.280> make<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.910> six

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
know and the point was to make the six

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.430 
know and the point was to make the six
other<00:01:08.420> different<00:01:08.810> points<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.080> view<00:01:09.230> that<00:01:09.260> were

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
other different points of view that were

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.630 
other different points of view that were
you<00:01:09.620> know<00:01:09.650> as<00:01:09.830> different<00:01:10.190> from<00:01:10.220> mine<00:01:10.490> as

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
you know as different from mine as

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.140 
you know as different from mine as
possible<00:01:11.120> so<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:13.250> was<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.880> was<00:01:14.000> really

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
possible so it was it was really

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.630 
possible so it was it was really

it<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.580> was<00:01:38.150> required<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.260> assemble<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.280> and

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
it I was required to assemble it all and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.610 
it I was required to assemble it all and
and<00:01:40.700> do<00:01:41.180> some<00:01:41.390> fine-tuning<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:42.260> some<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
and do some fine-tuning on some of the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.280 
and do some fine-tuning on some of the
editing<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.310> supervise<00:01:43.730> the<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.810> sound<00:01:45.020> mix

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
editing and supervise the the sound mix

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.380 
editing and supervise the the sound mix
and<00:01:45.530> then<00:01:45.680> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
and then the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.360 
and then the
the<00:01:46.570> vocal<00:01:47.320> tracks<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.920> then<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.190> know<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
the vocal tracks and then you know the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.820 
the vocal tracks and then you know the
scoring<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.120> so<00:01:49.930> it's<00:01:50.050> very<00:01:50.229> heavily<00:01:50.560> involved

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
scoring so so it's very heavily involved

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.380 
scoring so so it's very heavily involved
at<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.130> end<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.370> it<00:01:51.490> but<00:01:51.729> in<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.970> middle<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.240> it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
at the end of it but in the middle of it

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.130 
at the end of it but in the middle of it
not<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:52.720> much<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:58.330> actual<00:01:58.630> connections<00:01:59.020> to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
not so much the actual connections to

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.410 
not so much the actual connections to
the<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.830> Batman<00:02:00.130> film<00:02:00.820> franchise<00:02:01.270> the
