around the outside does a couple of
things<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:47.090> covers<00:01:47.450> up<00:01:47.540> any<00:01:47.750> small<00:01:48.080> gaps<00:01:48.380> that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
things it covers up any small gaps that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.609 
things it covers up any small gaps that
I<00:01:48.680> might<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.160> around<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.610> cut<00:01:49.850> in<00:01:50.060> my<00:01:50.210> door

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
I might have around the cut in my door

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.650 
I might have around the cut in my door
but<00:01:51.619> also<00:01:51.979> determines<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.910> depth<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
but also determines the depth of the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.480 
but also determines the depth of the
bookshelf<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.860> door<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:58.250> time

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
bookshelf in the door and now it's time

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.270 
bookshelf in the door and now it's time
to<00:01:58.520> slap<00:01:58.910> some<00:01:59.150> paint

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.590 

look<00:02:03.700> through<00:02:03.850> them<00:02:03.969> pretty<00:02:04.149> good<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:04.570> you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
look through them pretty good but you

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.850 
look through them pretty good but you
probably<00:02:04.899> notice<00:02:05.200> there<00:02:05.380> is<00:02:05.500> something

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
probably notice there is something

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.370 
probably notice there is something
missing<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.369> back<00:02:06.909> in<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> bookcase<00:02:07.450> certainly

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
missing a back in the bookcase certainly

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.410 
missing a back in the bookcase certainly
needs<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.770> I've<00:02:09.520> actually<00:02:09.700> got<00:02:10.000> two<00:02:10.209> small

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
needs it I've actually got two small

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.059 
needs it I've actually got two small
pieces<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.200> back<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.530> reason<00:02:11.830> for<00:02:11.950> that

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
pieces for the back the reason for that

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.380 
pieces for the back the reason for that
is<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:12.580> cheaper<00:02:12.910> than<00:02:13.030> buying<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
is because it's cheaper than buying a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.390 
is because it's cheaper than buying a
pool<00:02:13.569> chute<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:14.470> less<00:02:14.709> waste<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.220> it's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
pool chute you have less waste and it's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
pool chute you have less waste and it's
easier<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> transport<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.660> make<00:02:16.900> sure<00:02:17.110> you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
easier to transport just make sure you

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
easier to transport just make sure you
join<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.680> over<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.310> shelf<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:19.269> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
join is over the back of a shelf but the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.000 
join is over the back of a shelf but the
reason<00:02:19.630> I'm<00:02:19.720> putting<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.080> back<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.500> last<00:02:20.739> is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
reason I'm putting the back on last is

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.890 
reason I'm putting the back on last is
because<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.459> whole<00:02:21.640> shelf<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> lot<00:02:22.450> easier

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
because the whole shelf is a lot easier

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.440 
because the whole shelf is a lot easier
to<00:02:23.050> paint<00:02:23.349> with<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> back<00:02:23.920> off<00:02:24.330> there's<00:02:25.330> no

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
to paint with the back off there's no

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.449 
to paint with the back off there's no
