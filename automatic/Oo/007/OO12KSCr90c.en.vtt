00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
down the valley and that's probably my

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.490 
down the valley and that's probably my
favorite<00:00:29.099> song<00:00:29.279> random<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.989> decided<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
favorite song random so I decided to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
favorite song random so I decided to
make<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.649> video<00:00:31.829> I<00:00:32.040> figured<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.090> day

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

and<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.200> too<00:00:34.530> difficult<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.250> only<00:00:35.489> part

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and it's not too difficult the only part

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
and it's not too difficult the only part
is<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> picking<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.320> play<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> riff<00:00:37.829> on

I pitch to chorus part in the middle
somewhere<00:01:02.100> visit<00:01:02.819> G<00:01:02.999> added<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> end

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
somewhere visit G added on in the end

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.270 
somewhere visit G added on in the end
it's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.220> 4<00:01:05.430> chord<00:01:05.670> progression<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:07.130> just<00:01:08.130> for

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's a 4 chord progression but just for

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
it's a 4 chord progression but just for
the<00:01:08.340> intro<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.240> pretty<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.720> based<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.170> C

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the intro it's pretty much based on C

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
the intro it's pretty much based on C
but<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.190> has<00:01:11.310> F<00:01:11.550> notes<00:01:11.820> incorporated

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
but it has F notes incorporated

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
but it has F notes incorporated
throughout<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> picking<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.620> some<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> minor

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
throughout the picking and some a minor

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
throughout the picking and some a minor
notes<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.380> makes<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.680> pretty

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
notes so that's what makes it pretty

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.550 
notes so that's what makes it pretty
cool<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> picking<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> want<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
cool for the picking if you want to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.380 
cool for the picking if you want to
practice<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.900> put<00:01:22.040> your<00:01:23.040> pinkie<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> 3rd

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
practice it put your pinkie on the 3rd

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.370 
practice it put your pinkie on the 3rd
fret<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.710> make<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> C<00:01:26.190> chord<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.840> that's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
fret and then make a C chord and that's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.490 
fret and then make a C chord and that's
the<00:01:28.470> beginning<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.860> song<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> take<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.260> thumb

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
put it on the 2nd string take your

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480 
put it on the 2nd string take your
pointer<00:01:35.340> finger<00:01:35.610> third<00:01:36.470> or<00:01:37.470> fourth<00:01:38.160> sorry

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
pointer finger third or fourth sorry

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.300 
pointer finger third or fourth sorry
fifth<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.690> six<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.920> pinky<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
fifth and then six and your pinky is the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.440 
fifth and then six and your pinky is the
last<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.850> only<00:01:41.970> playing<00:01:42.150> four

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
last one so you're only playing four

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.420 
last one so you're only playing four
strings

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
strings

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.000 
strings
so<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.760> first<00:01:44.940> pluck<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.800> string

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
so that's the first pluck of the string

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.420 
so that's the first pluck of the string
in<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.220> song<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.760> intro<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:50.310> you're

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
in the song in the intro and then you're

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.110 
in the song in the intro and then you're
going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> play<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> second<00:01:51.330> string<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:53.120> then

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
going to play the second string and then

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.540 
going to play the second string and then
you're<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.420> play<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.690> fifth<00:01:54.900> string<00:01:55.550> so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
you're going to play the fifth string so

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.400 
you're going to play the fifth string so
it's<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.330> it's<00:01:57.630> kind<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.900> quickly<00:01:58.110> play

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
it's kind of a it's kind of quickly play

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.429 
it's kind of a it's kind of quickly play
although

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.510 

so<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.710> practice<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.249> a<00:02:05.429> while

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so if you just practice this for a while

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.649 
so if you just practice this for a while
you're<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:05.999> the<00:02:06.119> pattern<00:02:06.479> down<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
you're going to get the pattern down and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.999 
you're going to get the pattern down and
we'll<00:02:06.929> be<00:02:06.990> easier<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.409> play<00:02:09.530> okay<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.590> once<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
we'll be easier to play okay so once you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.000 
we'll be easier to play okay so once you
get<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> picking<00:02:11.489> down<00:02:11.640> again<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:13.010> all

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
get the picking down again it's just all

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.470 
get the picking down again it's just all
four<00:02:14.459> strings<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.629> second<00:02:16.110> string<00:02:16.349> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
four strings and then second string and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.670 
four strings and then second string and
then<00:02:18.480> fifth<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.019> fourth<00:02:19.230> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.870 

so<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:26.860> if<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.220> get<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.460> down<00:02:27.640> pretty

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
so that's if you get that down pretty

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.550 
so that's if you get that down pretty
good<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.540> song<00:02:28.720> will<00:02:28.840> be<00:02:28.870> way<00:02:29.050> easier<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.320> play

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
good the song will be way easier to play

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.170

but these are cut this count is cut in

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.229 
but these are cut this count is cut in
half<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.580> it's<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.849> be<00:03:22.000> open<00:03:22.569> third<00:03:24.239> open

then you're going to go open third open
again<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:16.190> it's<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.810> it's<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:24.729> so<00:04:25.729> for<00:04:25.880> that

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
again so it's so it's a so for that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.580 
again so it's so it's a so for that
picking<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.570> little<00:04:26.840> difficult<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.320> get<00:04:27.470> the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
picking is a little difficult to get the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.950 
picking is a little difficult to get the
timing<00:04:27.830> because<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.660> different

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
timing because the it's a different

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.840 
timing because the it's a different
count<00:04:30.139> right<00:04:30.320> at<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.650> end<00:04:30.800> right<00:04:30.919> there<00:04:31.010> at

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
count right at the end right there at

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.750 
count right at the end right there at
the<00:04:32.330> beginning<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.080> if<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.710> just<00:04:33.919> listen<00:04:34.610> and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
the beginning so if you just listen and

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.890 
the beginning so if you just listen and
try<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.940> figure<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.240> out<00:04:35.389> it's<00:04:35.570> pretty<00:04:35.750> easy

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
try to figure it out it's pretty easy

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.969 
try to figure it out it's pretty easy
it's<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:40.310> brand<00:04:41.180> name<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.360> just<00:04:41.740> pick<00:04:42.740> each

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
it's just a brand name is just pick each

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.840 
it's just a brand name is just pick each
note<00:04:43.340> individually<00:04:44.060> instead<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.690> doing<00:04:45.169> that

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
note individually instead of doing that

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.510 
note individually instead of doing that
for<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.970> last<00:04:47.120> three<00:04:47.300> notes<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.919> then<00:04:48.919> for

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
for the last three notes and then for

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.219 
for the last three notes and then for
the<00:04:49.610> second<00:04:49.970> part<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.570> rift<00:04:50.810> you're<00:04:51.110> going

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
the second part of the rift you're going

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.700 
the second part of the rift you're going
to<00:04:51.290> go<00:04:51.380> this<00:04:51.710> is<00:04:51.860> where<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.130> transposed<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:52.970> F

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
to go this is where it transposed to F

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.190 
to go this is where it transposed to F
while<00:04:54.710> you're<00:04:54.860> staying<00:04:55.100> in<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.639> C<00:04:56.090> formation<00:04:56.630> so

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
while you're staying in a C formation so

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.279 
while you're staying in a C formation so
it's<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:01.720> then<00:05:02.720> you're<00:05:02.810> going<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:02.990> take<00:05:03.139> your

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
it's and then you're going to take your

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.930

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
fret of the fourth string that makes the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.980 
fret of the fourth string that makes the
F<00:05:09.620> sound

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.290

going to pick the fifth string

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.990

just going to play it open as a C so

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.790 
just going to play it open as a C so
you're<00:05:33.590> pretty<00:05:33.740> much<00:05:33.860> going<00:05:34.130> F<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.820> C<00:05:35.800> but

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
you're pretty much going F to C but

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800 
you're pretty much going F to C but
you're<00:05:36.949> picking<00:05:37.250> it<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.850> not<00:05:38.270> changing<00:05:38.690> your

finger in on the on the chords so

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:53.200 
finger in on the on the chords so

do these hammer ons that they like to do

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.990 
do these hammer ons that they like to do
in<00:06:16.539> the<00:06:16.599> song<00:06:16.810> it's<00:06:17.110> just<00:06:17.169> the<00:06:17.379> middle<00:06:17.620> finger

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
in the song it's just the middle finger

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.490 
in the song it's just the middle finger
you<00:06:19.000> take<00:06:19.210> it<00:06:19.330> off<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:19.539> C<00:06:19.720> chord<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.169> then<00:06:20.349> you

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
you take it off the C chord and then you

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.779 
you take it off the C chord and then you
just<00:06:20.680> place<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:20.889> right<00:06:21.009> back<00:06:21.159> on<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:21.460> second

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
just place it right back on the second

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.510 
just place it right back on the second
fret<00:06:21.970> of<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.120> third<00:06:22.360> string<00:06:22.389> so<00:06:23.020> it's

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.159 

and<00:06:26.970> they<00:06:27.360> do<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:27.569> a<00:06:27.630> lot<00:06:27.840> throughout<00:06:28.050> the

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
and they do that a lot throughout the

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.439 
and they do that a lot throughout the
song<00:06:28.319> so<00:06:29.069> for<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.340> intro<00:06:29.699> it's<00:06:30.030> going<00:06:30.300> to

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
song so for the intro it's going to

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:46.490 
song so for the intro it's going to
sound<00:06:31.050> like<00:06:31.229> this<00:06:31.410> I'll<00:06:31.860> play<00:06:32.280> it<00:06:32.340> slow<00:06:32.520> first

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.410 

okay<00:06:47.500> for<00:06:47.770> the<00:06:47.890> part<00:06:48.130> where<00:06:48.220> he<00:06:49.090> goes<00:06:49.240> really

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
okay for the part where he goes really

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.510 
okay for the part where he goes really
high<00:06:49.570> cutting<00:06:50.500> on<00:06:50.650> the<00:06:50.710> course<00:06:50.950> when<00:06:51.490> that

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
high cutting on the course when that

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.810 
high cutting on the course when that
song<00:06:52.120> slows<00:06:52.360> down<00:06:52.570> and<00:06:52.960> he<00:06:53.560> just<00:06:53.700> strums<00:06:54.700> the

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
song slows down and he just strums the

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:04.290 
song slows down and he just strums the
one<00:06:55.000> chord<00:06:55.330> and<00:06:55.630> goes<00:07:02.760> this<00:07:03.760> is<00:07:03.820> going<00:07:04.120> to<00:07:04.180> be

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
one chord and goes this is going to be

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:14.790 
one chord and goes this is going to be
an<00:07:04.390> F<00:07:04.660> to<00:07:05.440> a<00:07:05.470> minor<00:07:06.150> to<00:07:07.150> C<00:07:07.510> to<00:07:08.200> G<00:07:09.000> F<00:07:10.000> a<00:07:11.070> minor<00:07:12.540> C<00:07:13.800> to

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
an F to a minor to C to G F a minor C to

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.880 
an F to a minor to C to G F a minor C to
G<00:07:15.100> so<00:07:15.780> that's<00:07:16.780> pretty<00:07:16.990> simple<00:07:17.200> and<00:07:17.500> that<00:07:17.590> goes

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
G so that's pretty simple and that goes

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.500 
G so that's pretty simple and that goes
on<00:07:18.100> for<00:07:18.310> a<00:07:18.370> while<00:07:18.490> starts<00:07:18.880> to<00:07:18.940> speed<00:07:19.180> up<00:07:19.330> to<00:07:21.510> buy

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.510 
on for a while starts to speed up to buy

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.110 
on for a while starts to speed up to buy
some<00:07:22.750> yoo-hoo
