system and I thought after Windows P
they<00:01:44.430> fix<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.990> still<00:01:46.229> puts<00:01:46.470> important

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
they fix this it still puts important

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
they fix this it still puts important
files<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.280> those<00:01:47.399> drives<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
files in those drives and if one of

files in those drives and if one of
those<00:01:48.930> drives<00:01:49.200> died<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.729> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
those drives died you still can and so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.660 
those drives died you still can and so
you<00:01:51.030> can't<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.509> into<00:01:51.750> Windows<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.549> hoping<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you can't get into Windows so hoping I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
you can't get into Windows so hoping I
could<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.880> repair<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.649> move<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:55.890> my

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
could just repair it and move on with my

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
could just repair it and move on with my
life<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.520> re-edit<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> 10<00:01:58.229> hours<00:01:58.469> of
