 Gonzalo race that was lost but it was 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.110
 a carrerón the truth 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.950
 to win we did everything well committed 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950
 errors throughout the race 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 ag new category I do not know why but 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.820
 look in the mirror and do not look at the flag that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 going to do nothing happens the track so 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.480
 to see who is running by 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.430
 53,000 is when you noticed 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.840
 that was complicated by contrast in the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 last curve 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 and where he ran he started now by 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 outside 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 Juan, good, I would go inside 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.660
 because he started to go next to me the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.860
 lagged because the other out there like that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.860
 than nothing 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.900
 to look for the next rematch in the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.900
 matías work 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.740
 is the second of the race and here the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.660
 great winner of the weekend with a 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.640
 Impressive end not suitable for 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.470
 cardiac congratulations one 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.620
 thank you very much 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.560
 and it was not suitable for cardiac and good for 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.050
 there he played a trick on montenegro 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.820
 the stragglers but good are things of the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.770
 race a race ends in the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.450
 flag box that good by luck 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.490
 we could make a good maneuver and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.740
 advance to the straight and overcome it 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.240
 They come well justito and to get there 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.620

 officially until you confirm both 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.520
 sporting as technically 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.150
 of the race that we just saw well 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.970
 they are already retreating safely there 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.710
 family friends people who have come to

 enjoy beyond the condition of 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.090
 weather of this race we really have 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.420
 had an end at a certain time that did not 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.680
 we had an electrifying ending and one 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.450
 does memory remember that final that 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.570
 you shared it with hector camps with the 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.070
 remembered marmoset when bernal and whistling without 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.500
 lag of average finishes a race 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.080
 almost equally clear and the year 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.050
 spent here on the silver the end of the 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.410
 national tourism was like that for 1000 island 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.980
 it was also defined in the same curve 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.500
 but without lag in that opportunity 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.150
 so it's good here we in this 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.020
 moment of tranquility as here is 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.460
 rodrigo rogani the grapefruit of pujato with 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.830

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.800
 to fabbiani just if the manager of the 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.450

 mount the glasses above indicating everything 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.170
 because the race comes the want 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.670
 ROGANI mouras and long in the front row 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.670
 let me make a rectification
