it's after a day of hearing about cars
with<00:00:14.190> more<00:00:14.370> horsepower<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.540> heard<00:00:15.719> about<00:00:15.839> one

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
with more horsepower we heard about one

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.560 
with more horsepower we heard about one
with<00:00:16.410> less<00:00:16.770> horsepower<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.820> significantly

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570

more fuel economy back suber is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.609 
more fuel economy back suber is
promising<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.689> car<00:00:21.900> makes<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.260> thirty

percent<00:00:23.070> improvement<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.820> fuel<00:00:23.850> economy<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
percent improvement in fuel economy and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
percent improvement in fuel economy and
that's<00:00:25.260> very<00:00:25.650> good<00:00:25.920> news<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.699> while<00:00:27.150> we'd

improvements<00:00:54.989> too<00:00:55.500> you'll<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
improvements too you'll see that the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
improvements too you'll see that the
wheelbase<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.210> increased<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:58.050> inch<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.770> what

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
wheelbase is increased an inch and what

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
wheelbase is increased an inch and what
this<00:00:59.190> does<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> allows<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.570> bit

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this does is it allows for a little bit

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
this does is it allows for a little bit

Subarus particularly Impreza's but here

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.630 
Subarus particularly Impreza's but here
we<00:01:07.500> find<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.890> little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.400> more

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
we find it's a little bit more

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.359 
we find it's a little bit more

model year is that the Impreza has a

makes the outward view a little bit

key benefit of the change of proportions

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.030 
key benefit of the change of proportions
is<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.259> easier<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> car

important and key to the story here is
the<00:01:35.930> transmission<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:37.340> looks<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.820> an
