00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
look a little bit more seamless right at

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.380 
look a little bit more seamless right at
the<00:02:30.470> edges<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:31.549> technique<00:02:31.970> will<00:02:32.090> not<00:02:32.239> only

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
the edges this technique will not only

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.030 
the edges this technique will not only
make<00:02:32.570> your<00:02:32.720> cheekbones<00:02:33.110> appear<00:02:33.440> higher<00:02:33.680> but

it will also help to conceal dark

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.060 
it will also help to conceal dark
circles<00:02:35.510> because<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.350> bringing<00:02:36.530> more<00:02:36.799> light

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
circles because it's bringing more light

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.820 
circles because it's bringing more light
to<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.400> area<00:02:37.840> make<00:02:38.840> sure<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.200> set<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:39.709> in

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
straightaway you were probably going a
