00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
don't think that that means that they're

the<00:00:53.070> rulers<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> diamond<00:00:53.910> authority<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> think

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the rulers a diamond authority I think

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
the rulers a diamond authority I think
that<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.780> means<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.590> part<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that just means that they are part of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.560 
that just means that they are part of
the<00:00:56.219> dumbest<00:00:56.579> yeah<00:00:56.730> yeah<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the dumbest yeah yeah they're not the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
the dumbest yeah yeah they're not the
ruler<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> they're<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.320> part<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ruler is they're just part of it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
ruler is they're just part of it
let's<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> homeworld<00:01:00.239> thing

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

anyway so you know the diamond is the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.759 
anyway so you know the diamond is the
closest<00:01:03.660> thing<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.930> yield<00:01:04.260> em<00:01:04.439> could<00:01:04.650> be

would be Jasper but it definitely could

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.219 
would be Jasper but it definitely could
not<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.750> Jasper

this<00:01:33.869> third<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.040> already<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
this third one because we already know a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
this third one because we already know a
sentence<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.720> her<00:01:36.960> however<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> doesn't

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sentence about her however that doesn't

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
sentence about her however that doesn't
mean<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.250> student<00:01:38.460> bomb<00:01:38.880> number<00:01:39.150> two

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
mean that the student bomb number two

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120 
mean that the student bomb number two
does<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.869> give<00:01:40.049> us<00:01:40.140> any<00:01:40.290> hints<00:01:40.650> towards<00:01:40.829> them

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
does not give us any hints towards them

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.859 
does not give us any hints towards them
to<00:01:41.280> authority<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.540> in

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to authority because as you can see in

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.510 
to authority because as you can see in
store<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> sword<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.130> enter<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
store to the sword when they enter the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.160 
store to the sword when they enter the
battlefield<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:45.960> looks<00:01:46.110> like

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
battlefield you can see well looks like

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260 
battlefield you can see well looks like
I'm<00:01:46.380> Dimond<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:46.979> four<00:01:47.310> small<00:01:47.670> diamonds<00:01:48.180> in

I'm Dimond with four small diamonds in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
I'm Dimond with four small diamonds in
it<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> same<00:01:49.049> colors<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> diamond<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it it's the same colors of diamond as in

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
it it's the same colors of diamond as in
jail<00:01:50.790> break<00:01:51.060> through<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.780> fourth<00:01:52.320> diamond

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
jail break through this fourth diamond

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.830 
jail break through this fourth diamond
which<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.670> pink<00:01:53.909> diamond<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
which is the pink diamond a lot of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
which is the pink diamond a lot of
people<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.619> rose<00:01:55.890> quartz

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
people think that this is rose quartz

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.770 
people think that this is rose quartz
Assyria<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.909> started<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> gain<00:01:57.329> ground<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
Assyria that started to gain ground and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
Assyria that started to gain ground and
makes<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.079> ton<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> sense<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:59.219> my

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
makes a ton of sense right actually my

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.870 
makes a ton of sense right actually my
theory<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.960> lar<00:02:01.380> yes<00:02:01.979> holes<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.759> his

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
theory is that it's lar yes holes in his

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 
theory is that it's lar yes holes in his
ears<00:02:03.270> words<00:02:03.509> dad<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.229> discussed<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.740> already

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
ears words dad we discussed this already

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.270 
ears words dad we discussed this already
huh<00:02:05.340> no<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.270> Lars<00:02:06.600> fine<00:02:07.290> anyways<00:02:08.099> people

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
huh no it's not Lars fine anyways people

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
huh no it's not Lars fine anyways people
think<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.940> pink<00:02:09.179> diamond<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.899> rose

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think that that pink diamond is rose

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
think that that pink diamond is rose
quartz<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.129> battlefield<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
quartz because the battlefield had the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.750 
quartz because the battlefield had the
sign<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
sign on

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.970 
sign on
was<00:02:13.209> from<00:02:13.629> my<00:02:13.810> floor<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.470> rebellion

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
was from my floor that the rebellion

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.979 
was from my floor that the rebellion
began<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.939> means<00:02:16.090> rose<00:02:16.299> quartz<00:02:16.569> could

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
began so that means rose quartz could

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.690 
began so that means rose quartz could
very<00:02:17.290> well<00:02:17.379> be<00:02:17.709> part<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.129> authority<00:02:18.549> by

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
very well be part of the authority by

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.330 
very well be part of the authority by
then<00:02:18.879> but<00:02:19.209> after<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.379> this<00:02:20.620> events<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
then but after that in this events of

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.830 
then but after that in this events of
jailbreak<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.269> can<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.480> there's<00:02:22.720> always

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
jailbreak you can see there's always

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.539 
jailbreak you can see there's always
three<00:02:23.200> diamonds<00:02:23.560> there<00:02:23.769> which<00:02:24.069> means<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
three diamonds there which means that

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.100 
three diamonds there which means that
would<00:02:24.819> probably<00:02:25.000> be<00:02:25.180> because<00:02:25.360> record

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
would probably be because record

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.110 
would probably be because record
rebelled<00:02:26.860> against<00:02:27.220> them<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.610> also<00:02:27.790> rose

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
rebelled against them and also rose

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.509 
rebelled against them and also rose
quartz<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:28.629> again<00:02:29.379> pretty<00:02:29.709> big<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.370> powerful

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
quartz is again pretty big and powerful

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.149 
quartz is again pretty big and powerful
gem<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.239> she<00:02:31.480> also<00:02:31.629> has<00:02:31.840> two<00:02:32.019> weapons<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.040> it

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
gem and she also has two weapons so it

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.140 
gem and she also has two weapons so it
makes<00:02:33.340> sense<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.579> she<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.819> one<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> more

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
makes sense that she was one of the more

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.420 
makes sense that she was one of the more
important<00:02:34.569> gems<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.989> authority<00:02:35.500> yeah<00:02:35.980> she's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
important gems in authority yeah she's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.610 
important gems in authority yeah she's
probably<00:02:36.849> powerful<00:02:37.659> enough<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.049> be<00:02:38.260> one<00:02:38.440> of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
probably powerful enough to be one of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.789 
probably powerful enough to be one of
the<00:02:38.769> thorat<00:02:39.609> so<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.930> only<00:02:41.049> reason<00:02:41.409> she's<00:02:41.769> not

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
the thorat so the only reason she's not

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.130 
the thorat so the only reason she's not
in<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.489> one<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.849> jailbreak<00:02:43.359> is<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:43.900> that

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
in the one in jailbreak is because that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.460 
in the one in jailbreak is because that
is<00:02:44.409> made<00:02:44.980> after<00:02:45.269> whatever<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.200> stadium

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
is made after whatever the the stadium

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
is made after whatever the the stadium
and<00:02:47.769> storm<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.159> sword<00:02:48.549> was<00:02:48.790> made<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.450> by

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
and storm to the sword was made so by

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.990 
and storm to the sword was made so by
then<00:02:50.109> she<00:02:50.440> rebelled<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.099> she's<00:02:51.340> not<00:02:51.670> part<00:02:51.940> of

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
then she rebelled and she's not part of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.670 
then she rebelled and she's not part of
that<00:02:52.150> authority<00:02:52.209> anymore<00:02:52.720> as<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.349> can<00:02:53.470> sell

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
that authority anymore as you can sell

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.860 
that authority anymore as you can sell
pearl<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.519> lapis<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.389> all<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.599> other<00:02:55.720> people

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
pearl and lapis and all the other people

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.479 
pearl and lapis and all the other people
are<00:02:56.139> marveling<00:02:56.560> at<00:02:56.680> how<00:02:56.889> new<00:02:57.280> all<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
are marveling at how new all the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.670 
are marveling at how new all the
technology<00:02:58.120> from<00:02:58.269> homeworld<00:02:58.659> is<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.409> that<00:02:59.560> was

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
technology from homeworld is so that was

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440 
technology from homeworld is so that was
a<00:02:59.709> ship<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.099> definitely<00:03:00.430> made<00:03:00.639> after<00:03:01.209> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
a ship was definitely made after the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720 
a ship was definitely made after the
rebelled<00:03:01.780> instead<00:03:02.139> of<00:03:02.230> her<00:03:02.379> exactly<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.310> I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
rebelled instead of her exactly and I

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 
rebelled instead of her exactly and I
haven't<00:03:04.000> heard<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.420> theory<00:03:04.720> about<00:03:05.019> very

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
haven't heard this theory about very

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.379 
haven't heard this theory about very
often<00:03:05.769> but<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.340> actually<00:03:06.730> guys<00:03:06.970> think<00:03:07.269> that

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
often but I actually guys think that

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.180 
often but I actually guys think that
blue<00:03:07.569> Donna<00:03:07.840> might<00:03:08.109> be<00:03:08.230> laughing<00:03:08.650> she<00:03:09.040> has<00:03:09.159> a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
blue Donna might be laughing she has a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.710 
blue Donna might be laughing she has a
diamond<00:03:09.489> on<00:03:09.700> her<00:03:09.819> shirt<00:03:10.060> for<00:03:10.299> Dartmouth<00:03:10.629> but

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
diamond on her shirt for Dartmouth but

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.119 
diamond on her shirt for Dartmouth but
maybe<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.109> reason<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.620> other<00:03:11.650> people

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
maybe the reason that the other people

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.470 
maybe the reason that the other people
don't<00:03:12.250> recognize<00:03:12.730> her<00:03:12.879> is<00:03:13.000> because<00:03:13.150> she<00:03:13.420> was

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
don't recognize her is because she was

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.629 
don't recognize her is because she was
reformed<00:03:14.049> but<00:03:14.260> since<00:03:14.500> she<00:03:14.650> was<00:03:14.680> reformed<00:03:15.340> over

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
reformed but since she was reformed over

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.610 
reformed but since she was reformed over
a<00:03:15.700> crack<00:03:15.970> gem<00:03:16.269> she<00:03:16.810> didn't<00:03:17.049> look<00:03:17.139> exactly<00:03:17.290> like

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
a crack gem she didn't look exactly like

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.050 
a crack gem she didn't look exactly like
she<00:03:17.829> did<00:03:18.010> before<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:18.549> she<00:03:18.579> was<00:03:18.730> probably

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
she did before when she was probably

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.789 
she did before when she was probably
down<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.299> authority<00:03:19.720> directly<00:03:20.199> and<00:03:20.709> that's

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
down to authority directly and that's

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.409 
down to authority directly and that's
actually<00:03:21.220> might<00:03:21.370> be<00:03:21.400> why<00:03:21.669> she<00:03:21.730> decide<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.180> stay

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
actually might be why she decide to stay

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.180 
actually might be why she decide to stay
in<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.599> crashing<00:03:22.989> ship<00:03:23.230> because<00:03:23.799> maybe<00:03:23.980> she

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
in the crashing ship because maybe she

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.069 
in the crashing ship because maybe she
thought<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.549> if<00:03:24.669> physical<00:03:25.329> illusion<00:03:25.720> form

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
thought that if physical illusion form

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.659 
thought that if physical illusion form
was<00:03:26.199> destroyed<00:03:26.560> then<00:03:27.069> she'd<00:03:27.310> be<00:03:27.430> able<00:03:27.489> to

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
was destroyed then she'd be able to

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.390 
was destroyed then she'd be able to
reform<00:03:28.000> as<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.569> actual<00:03:29.049> environment<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:30.220> is

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
reform as the actual environment that is

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.729 
reform as the actual environment that is
a<00:03:30.430> pretty<00:03:31.030> good<00:03:31.329> theory<00:03:31.629> actually<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:32.590> then

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
a pretty good theory actually but then

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
a pretty good theory actually but then
the<00:03:32.829> problem<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.819> she<00:03:34.150> was<00:03:34.269> gone<00:03:34.449> for<00:03:34.510> that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the problem is if she was gone for that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.289 
the problem is if she was gone for that
long<00:03:34.870> then<00:03:35.859> don't<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.310> think<00:03:36.579> that<00:03:36.790> instead

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
long then don't you think that instead

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.909 
long then don't you think that instead
of<00:03:37.389> having<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.870> three<00:03:38.109> gems<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.709> would<00:03:38.829> have

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
of having the three gems it would have

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.500 
of having the three gems it would have
turned<00:03:39.099> just<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.519> two<00:03:39.699> gems<00:03:39.970> would<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.269> be<00:03:40.389> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
turned just a two gems would to be the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.240 
turned just a two gems would to be the
yellow<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.169> white<00:03:41.620> one<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.040> that

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
yellow one and white one and that

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.039 
yellow one and white one and that
actually<00:03:42.579> fit<00:03:42.730> together<00:03:42.849> to<00:03:43.629> turn<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.019> a

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
actually fit together to turn to a

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.900 
actually fit together to turn to a
regular<00:03:44.410> diamonds<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.400> don't<00:03:45.579> know<00:03:45.699> why<00:03:45.849> the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
regular diamonds so I don't know why the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.939 
regular diamonds so I don't know why the
would<00:03:46.120> have<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.449> so<00:03:46.720> he<00:03:46.989> did<00:03:47.169> the<00:03:47.290> blue<00:03:47.530> gem<00:03:47.739> off

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
would have to so he did the blue gem off

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.409 
would have to so he did the blue gem off
if<00:03:48.220> there<00:03:48.519> wasn't<00:03:48.790> actually<00:03:48.879> a<00:03:49.120> blue<00:03:49.269> diamond

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
if there wasn't actually a blue diamond

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.839 
if there wasn't actually a blue diamond
peeking<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:49.989> lapis<00:03:50.470> we<00:03:50.859> don't<00:03:51.040> actually<00:03:51.250> know

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
peeking of lapis we don't actually know

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.050 
peeking of lapis we don't actually know
how<00:03:52.540> does<00:03:53.230> she<00:03:53.260> get<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.310> mirror<00:03:54.699> because

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
how does she get in the mirror because

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.020 
how does she get in the mirror because
it<00:03:55.329> was<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.780> wasn't<00:03:55.989> two<00:03:56.230> gems<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.129> pearl<00:03:57.609> said

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
it was it wasn't two gems the pearl said

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.659 
it was it wasn't two gems the pearl said
that<00:03:58.329> she<00:03:58.569> found<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.409> in<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.739> Galaxy<00:04:00.310> warp

that she found it in the Galaxy warp
they<00:04:00.940> didn't<00:04:01.209> put<00:04:01.359> her<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.870> somebody<00:04:02.290> else

they didn't put her in it somebody else

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.289 
they didn't put her in it somebody else
probably<00:04:03.159> did<00:04:03.340> what<00:04:03.669> happened<00:04:04.030> during<00:04:04.150> the

Earth and some people might think that

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.469 
Earth and some people might think that
the<00:04:17.349> white<00:04:17.560> diamond<00:04:18.010> or<00:04:18.159> the<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:19.000> greenish

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
and that time very well could be green

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.970 
and that time very well could be green
because<00:04:24.909> the<00:04:25.030> lighting

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
because the lighting

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.070 
because the lighting
the<00:04:26.100> thing<00:04:26.730> is<00:04:26.940> peridot<00:04:27.420> is<00:04:27.510> actually<00:04:27.900> only

years<00:04:37.890> ago<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.730> would<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:38.880> impossible<00:04:39.200> yeah

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
years ago that would be impossible yeah

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.750 
years ago that would be impossible yeah
that's<00:04:40.680> for<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.920> white<00:04:41.070> one<00:04:41.250> though<00:04:41.430> we<00:04:41.640> have

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
that's for the white one though we have

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.210 
that's for the white one though we have
no<00:04:42.180> idea<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.780> could<00:04:42.900> possibly<00:04:43.230> be<00:04:43.320> probably

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
no idea that could possibly be probably

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.410 
no idea that could possibly be probably
just<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.700> new<00:04:45.120> gem<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:46.100> actually<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.880> very<00:04:48.180> well

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
just a new gem and actually it very well

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.440 
just a new gem and actually it very well
might<00:04:48.930> be<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.320> all<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.650> them<00:04:49.770> are<00:04:49.890> new<00:04:50.040> gems

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
might be that all of them are new gems

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.780 
might be that all of them are new gems
said<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:51.630> pink<00:04:51.930> one<00:04:52.140> is<00:04:52.380> pretty<00:04:52.830> rose<00:04:53.430> quartz

II<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.240> think<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.660> one<00:04:54.810> might<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:55.020> true

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
II and I think that one might be true

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.270 
II and I think that one might be true
that's<00:04:55.800> all<00:04:55.950> for<00:04:56.130> now

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
that's all for now

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.100 
that's all for now

this is Fred from decay of a team the
