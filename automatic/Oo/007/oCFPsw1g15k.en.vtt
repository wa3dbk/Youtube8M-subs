00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello welcome on how do I do 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.929
 am happy to meet you for a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.560
 new video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.900
 so we asked how to mount a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.710
 hook with a small loop as well 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 as you can see here in front 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:22.369
 you are simply going to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.650
 start by taking a son about 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 30 centimeters barça de wes a should 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 to be well then the son ilia mans it 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 depends on what you fish like me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.660
 I mainly fish big I'm going 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.730
 take a pretty big movie and this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 address but you can take nile 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.890
 obviously have the finest if you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 fishing for smaller fish is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.550
 valid for the are also it's a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.649
 hook big enough same is for the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 fishing à la carte but you can very 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.190
 to find something smaller 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 it works will all the same way 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.809
 so we'll start by hooking 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.379
 at the zone level 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 so we'll just make sure we 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:10.049
 will pass the thread in the little loop 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 in steel just see if we were doing 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.409
 it keeps the bait alone and we'll 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.310
 do 1 2 then for the nodes there is 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:25.680
 many ways the javou comm like 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 but the sound pretty effective so you 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.409
 take your hook this way 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.850
 you go with the left hand block 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.180
 a little bit sailboats so as to keep 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.170
 a little loop here right next to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.090
 the ring make it and we pass everything in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.329
 raising the little loop after 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 we're just going to wind up the film 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.500
 which remains to us this one could come 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 wrapped several times around the neck 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 in son 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.420
 so for that you saw I have I 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.369
 watched I put about 10 cm of thread 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.740
 and roll it at least five to six times 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.489
 the more we roll it over 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.780
 the lesson will be good finally the film 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.420
 will be very strong well here I am 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.260
 see the gem is about 6 t times 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.950
 we will now bring back the son who 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.230
 rest we will take it we will undo the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.840
 little loop and you see we're going 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.380
 expand a little bit a little bit the little 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.849
 loop 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.120
 so that's not always very good 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.630
 my iii the son who stays and we come 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.730
 pass the thread in the loop and there is 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 now here we shoot a little bit and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.290
 just before closing the set we're going 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.060
 pass it a little bit in the water for 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.310
 prevent the film from heating up then 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.840
 me it is enough too much it would ask 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.230
 no problem but if the street of the small 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.489
 son 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.590
 you always have to do that then if you 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.720
 do not have water when me here if you 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.660
 are in the end of the period in full 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.310
 fishing party you can put your 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.709
 celi or one that will work just as well 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.450
 it's just to prevent your son 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.810
 do not heat up and simply 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.780
 we will now keep the thread in fact 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.500
 sure to keep the wire like that and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.940
 on one side we will push hop is nathan 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.459
 of these facts that we are sure that he 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.600
 stays at seven sons 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.030
 we are going to push here 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.790
 two times 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.970
 we are sure the lesson is well me 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.579
 here we have a boy who is 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.810
 perfectly hang then you see 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.069
 there I did something 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.810
 really very solid at it's really 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.000
 for the very big but already with 4.5 me 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.769
 Back round 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.630
 normally it's fine but there 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.340
 you can go there your hook for 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.730
 kick ass it must be really necessary already 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.980
 healed then to prevent it from remaining 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.090
 wire that we pass them can keep a 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.220
 little bit but here it really 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.769
 a lot we just take a lighter 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.239
 or a chisel 1 and then we come 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.530
 I like the rochelle case 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.549
 it ends up doing something pretty 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.810
 clean here we come to remove the 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.810
 surplus and more especially it allows when 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.440
 it's thread 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.850
 of delattre is like me that allows 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.280
 to have something a little bit 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.139
 pretty pale and so if it ever came to 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.400
 picking it up would come hang on 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.419
 shot without having more solids of this 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.490
 way that's for the side they are 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.710
 sent we have something that holds 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.720
 well this is what is solid 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.380
 now it must be that your son 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.270
 you hook it to an elder rio so I 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.510
 always say - and morillon but I know 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.520
 that we say one would like his 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.800
 powers it's for just the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.660
 easy to remove 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.700
 if so and I do not know if you're going from 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.280
 carp fishing for fishing 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.320
 carnivorous so as not to have to 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.360
 disassemble everything will launch complete 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.960
 only the bottom of the line 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.740
 so for that we'll just do this 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.570
 blow a little a little loop 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.600
 shine then we make a small loop 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:21.010
 like that just hop 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.690
 and then we're going to wind up the loop 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:28.720
 and we're going to make a little knot at 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.460
 level of the loop so it's not 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.600
 easy like that to show see I have 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.160
 does a little knot and then now 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.560
 we will come the solid court and there 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.000
 normally with one you can you 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.160
 a little quiet you can be 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.710
 sure it's a precaution 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.360
 I like doing that I like 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.970
 precautions especially in fishing 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.570
 I'm doing a second little knot I'm doing 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:06:00.070
 well in getting out falls on my first no 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:06:02.970
 laugh and then I force 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.530
 now when just now we will do 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.270
 our lighter and simply we will come 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.850
 remove the surplus while leaving a 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.520
 little bit anyway 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.400
 it's insecurity see here you have 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.100
 a male line to ride with a sound you 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.979
 have the little loop that goes for lets 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.940
 to go hang your your downstairs 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.740
 line 1 and maurane emeriaud you can 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.440
 this buy-in on whatever she was throwing 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.930
 who is provided with a loved riom and then you 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.990
 especially have a leader with a 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.590
 boy who is heavily hung and on 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.440
 which you can take part in 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.460
 can fish nice catches 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.080
 especially with thread like mine 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.300
 can you guarantee that it really pulls 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.770
 so for the size of the wire or send 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.240
 there remains one sees we left on 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.280
 30 cm easy it does not stay easily 20 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.660
 you can reduce a little bit if you 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.790
 want a buy-in a little bit shorter 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.870
 to you to judge the greatness and then 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.220
 to make ballerinas and a little bit 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.520
 shorter but the principle will remain the 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.370
 even 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.340
 I hope this new video 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:15.390
 will serve many of you 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.600
 do not hesitate then to watch it 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.070
 many times I know it sounds 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.480
 simple like that when we're used to 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.590
 do it but it's a little bit 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.080
 complicated when we do it for the 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.750
 first time so here I hope it 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.490
 will serve you then that's good 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.760
 my soul went attention how 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.760
 does one
