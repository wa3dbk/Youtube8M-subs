me<00:02:10.020> especially<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.340> poor<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.910> with

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
me especially the poor me like this with

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.370 
me especially the poor me like this with
a<00:02:12.180> lot<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.450> different<00:02:12.750> teams<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> mean

doing<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.560> well<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.130> maybe<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
doing really well and then maybe a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.809 
doing really well and then maybe a
couple<00:02:21.150> guys<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.900> Avery<00:02:22.290> may<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.250> over

my whole life

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.180 
my whole life
I<00:02:56.849> think<00:02:57.060> my<00:02:57.510> first<00:02:57.750> match<00:02:57.959> was<00:02:58.230> right<00:02:58.859> about

I think my first match was right about

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.420 
I think my first match was right about
one<00:03:00.230> minute<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.530> was<00:03:01.650> three<00:03:02.099> years<00:03:02.129> old

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
one minute when I was three years old

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.729 
one minute when I was three years old
and<00:03:02.730> started<00:03:03.150> practicing<00:03:03.470> shortly<00:03:04.470> after

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
and started practicing shortly after

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.949 
and started practicing shortly after
that<00:03:04.859> so<00:03:05.250> I've<00:03:05.909> been<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.209> sport<00:03:06.450> my<00:03:06.599> whole<00:03:06.780> life
