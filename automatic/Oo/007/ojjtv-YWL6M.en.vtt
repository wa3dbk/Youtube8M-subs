00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hello and welcome again before I make a

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.230 
hello and welcome again before I make a
movie<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.549> valve<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.910> low<00:00:06.089> pressure

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
movie about this valve to low pressure

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.919 
movie about this valve to low pressure
valve<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.340> I<00:00:08.340> talked<00:00:08.610> about<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.059> Asia<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.719> my

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
valve and I talked about the Asia so my

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.310 
valve and I talked about the Asia so my
gr<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:11.389> hmm<00:00:12.450> long<00:00:12.660> time<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.049> change

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
gr is here hmm long time I change

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.029 
gr is here hmm long time I change
already<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.070> EGR<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:15.230> have<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:16.500> coats<00:00:16.740> for

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
already the EGR I have two coats for

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.640 
already the EGR I have two coats for
this<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.400> gr<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.150> stuck<00:00:18.420> open<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.470> is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
this is gr one is stuck open and one is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
this is gr one is stuck open and one is
the<00:00:19.830> sensor<00:00:22.279> okay<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.340> now<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> very<00:00:24.660> good<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the sensor okay so now is very good is

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.009 
the sensor okay so now is very good is
clean<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.220> wash<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.720> not<00:00:27.840> make

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
clean because I wash this but not make

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.880 
clean because I wash this but not make
any<00:00:28.199> difference

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
any difference

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.440 
any difference
and<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.949> leaver<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> linkage<00:00:34.010> see

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
and this leaver here is a linkage see

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.860 
and this leaver here is a linkage see
it's<00:00:36.450> supposed<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:38.300> see<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it's supposed to be go like that see you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920 
it's supposed to be go like that see you
have<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.200> touch<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> sometimes<00:00:42.360> why<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.719> my

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
have to touch so sometimes why not my

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
have to touch so sometimes why not my
car<00:00:43.170> turn<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> clean<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
car turn off and clean you do like this

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
car turn off and clean you do like this
all<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:47.719> what<00:00:48.719> II<00:00:48.930> cleaned<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.010> three

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
all the time what II cleaned like three

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700 
all the time what II cleaned like three
cycles<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> time<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> due<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.379> big

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
cycles all the time and due back a big

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
cycles all the time and due back a big
noise<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.520> something<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.809> but

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
noise I think is something like that but

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.670 
noise I think is something like that but
really<00:00:55.199> big<00:00:55.530> noise<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.320> not

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
really big noise so see this is not

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.270 
really big noise so see this is not
closed<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.399> well<00:01:00.530> what's<00:01:01.530> happen<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.070> car

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
closed very well what's happen if my car

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
closed very well what's happen if my car
is<00:01:02.309> sometimes<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.910> press<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> gas<00:01:03.650> nothing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
is sometimes I press the gas nothing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.969 
is sometimes I press the gas nothing
happen<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> later<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.670> take<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> foot<00:01:06.510> off<00:01:06.979> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
happen and later I take the foot off the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
happen and later I take the foot off the
gas<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> car<00:01:08.939> press<00:01:09.510> gas<00:01:09.689> alone<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.770> one

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
gas and the car press gas alone so one

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.480 
gas and the car press gas alone so one
day<00:01:11.400> almost<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.180> big<00:01:12.360> accident<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
day almost I have a big accident so I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
day almost I have a big accident so I
check<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> computer<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.080> give<00:01:16.409> me

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
check the computer and they give me

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.120 
check the computer and they give me
these<00:01:16.680> folds<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:19.530> don't<00:01:19.890> shut<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.520> well

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
these folds so see don't shut very well

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
these folds so see don't shut very well
so<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.610> replace<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:25.170> valve<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so then I replace this valve and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
so then I replace this valve and
actually<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> top<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.049> well

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
actually here and then the top as well

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually here and then the top as well
is<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> motor<00:01:29.090> smoking<00:01:30.090> money<00:01:30.240> inside<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
is the motor smoking money inside and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.160 
is the motor smoking money inside and
here<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> drive<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> motor<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.509> here

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
here is the drive of the motor and here

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.730 
here is the drive of the motor and here
is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> sensor<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.490> sensor<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:36.030> faulty<00:01:36.740> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is the sensor the sensor is faulty so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.179 
is the sensor the sensor is faulty so
you<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.299> educators<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.780> see

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
you have this educators here for see

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.010 
you have this educators here for see
well<00:01:41.189> deposition<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.180> grr

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
well deposition the grr

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.550 
well deposition the grr
so<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> ECU<00:01:44.310> can't<00:01:44.610> come<00:01:44.899> can<00:01:45.899> communicate<00:01:46.409> if

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so the ECU can't come can communicate if

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
so the ECU can't come can communicate if
the<00:01:46.799> EGR<00:01:47.280> probably<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.329> II<00:01:49.820> miss<00:01:50.820> enter<00:01:51.210> code

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the EGR probably so II miss enter code

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.330 
the EGR probably so II miss enter code
and<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> gate<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> time<00:01:55.829> opened

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and the gate is all the time opened

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.530 
and the gate is all the time opened
sometimes<00:01:56.729> stuck<00:01:57.000> open

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
sometimes stuck open

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.810 
sometimes stuck open
so<00:01:59.260> I<00:01:59.290> replaced<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.860> gr<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.370> car<00:02:00.610> works

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
so I replaced a gr and the car works

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.330 
so I replaced a gr and the car works
fine<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.840> most<00:02:02.260> common<00:02:02.530> problems<00:02:03.070> in<00:02:03.250> a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
fine is the most common problems in a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340 
fine is the most common problems in a
Mondeo<00:02:03.700> which<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.120> EGR<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.140> bow

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
Mondeo which is the EGR and that to bow

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.639 
Mondeo which is the EGR and that to bow
pressure<00:02:06.040> valve<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.570> okay<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.350> video

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
pressure valve so okay this is the video

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.500 
pressure valve so okay this is the video
for<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.070> valve<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.640> know<00:02:09.910> how<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.330> works

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
for the valve so you know how it works

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.450 
for the valve so you know how it works
now<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:11.470> any<00:02:11.620> problems<00:02:12.070> any<00:02:12.130> codes

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
now if you have any problems any codes

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.360 
now if you have any problems any codes
for<00:02:12.670> EGR<00:02:13.060> valve<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:14.290> first<00:02:14.530> thing<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.070> stuck

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
for EGR valve the first thing is stuck

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.700 
for EGR valve the first thing is stuck
open<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.880> can<00:02:16.060> try<00:02:16.270> clean<00:02:16.600> but<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.530> see

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
open you can try clean but if you see

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.010
