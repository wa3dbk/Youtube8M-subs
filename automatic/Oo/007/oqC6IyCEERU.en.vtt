00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.369
 no 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.459
 investigation 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.459
 m 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.480
 we must consolidate the decisive appointment for the first episode of the 

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:26.470
 season and it's a fact pass on the body 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.319
 victim of this criterion 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.429
 It's the big night 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.300
 his readers 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880
 we are a bit electric 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.570
 the mans this offer is not there but here it is a lexus ct 200h world the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.350
 babies 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.580
 he talked about a huge hybrid honda jazz bubble the final 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.140
 yes but this year the parallel parallel crime scene 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.690
 sift a series what the author calls a mudslide 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.590
 problem for the show 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.130
 I succeeded the brutal project with dsk there gfms approached the summer 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.980
 as well 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.980
 yes I lose it I can not for now the madeleine 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.960
 the Russian hunted m 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.019
 there 3rd generation prius 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.700
 both share the same engine 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.910
 but this new lexus that no longer exists high level and shares the same 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.869
 motorization 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.810
 that the two platoons in question and so c the new coach the study 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 here are the actors 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.350
 then to françois how does it work 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.290
 addressing 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.360
 a heat engine here it is a place of worship with essence of 99 days of stop 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.060
 the probable electric motor 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.650
 but much more powerful 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.810
 that on parallel hybrids 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.880
 here it's 60 kilowatts 82 'hot 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 so for the overall power after 180 horsepower 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.120
 and then in germany by the bank 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.580
 136 english horses 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.550
 end why not decide power 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.540
 elmar degenhart the first reason 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.340
 the most important is that the maxi power scary at the same 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.660
 regime is not in the same conditions as those of the engines 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.030
 electric the accord p so 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 anyway what's the most important with the electric motor 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.390
 it's the couple who for him and that heroes unique tower 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 howard franois how does the engine work is actually an electric motor 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.939
 its operation 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.270
 of thanks alex kremer of quite sophisticated power and so 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.850
 everything is accessible since 99 2 the first race it was already not bad 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.910
 still well progressed m 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.359
 and that's quite the point 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.449
 these ultra-sophisticated power electronics devices is not 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.309
 something at the delicate voice level 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.779
 effectively 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.139
 we do not have a box that put two mechanical speeds like you're going 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.829
 to do the hand here are the acts mans there it is not possible bastareaud a 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.899
 semblance of automatic transmission 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.199
 it's complicated 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:42.119
 toyota has for example 10 for the prius or lorient what these drinks 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.060
 cdt 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.010
 minutes and emphatic it's an atrapalo foot power splitter 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.669
 fr with 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.399
 prinz track yes to go on the satellite island it will go into detail 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:58.239
 the pharmacy and then with the pkk go a little bit of that allows 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.499
 to run the heat engine directly to the bottom or then the 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.169
 promoter or both in so many years past all the possibilities are 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.589
 possible operation 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:14.599
 this magic box it took first the attacker these three explanations 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.529
 still very personal it starts to another after the theory once a 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.390
 little bit of practice 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.809
 good bah so good wind with 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.589
 before the American justice 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.589
 but now he was stretched out his arms it's really the same 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.339
 good news they do not do clutch 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.749
 like any automotive vehicle 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.799
 Yes exactly 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.039
 we have good silence at the end i the press conference 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.099
 a religious silence for the small streets of valves 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.459
 the heat engine to contribution 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.789
 nevertheless still some small pieces of rolling 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.880
 yes but hey it's still my unique and absolute address 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.579
 m it's not wrong 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.599
 a consolation then in town 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.389
 the next morning at 40% compared to thermal engines and the same 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.449
 power 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.009
 40% less why because the heat engine is not used much 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.879
 ie in the passes a low load of very low power very 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.909
 poor performance 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.799
 it is mexico that takes over most of the time 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.279
 so some could save in itself 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:20.229
 for souleymane Tuesday we must get involved and 19 passes en route we can 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.039
 to count on 25% of savings to the maximum is a little rugged wax 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.800
 small slowdowns 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.560
 and it's not terrible and more when we start to need power 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.409
 the drink box cvt 10 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.990
 it is heard and it is not terrible 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.389
 you will be able to manage 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.710
 this year online 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.639
 white - e 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.770
 on the road 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.280
 on the highway it's not so bad it's not terrible all these engines 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.460
 thermal I put to work 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.220
 françoise always the same question 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.680
 lexus ct 200h do you buy where he was not hiding 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.309
 always after the same ans ans 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.779
 I hesitate 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.090
 its premium compact box 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.710
 it's still 29 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.439
 42 euros 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.639
 it's much more expensive than a prius but what would it take 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.200
 I will take good and niece of future generations that is done 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.589
 the hybrid the world to the point that half make up 10th three frank 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.589
 for example, there are 150 static pages 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.159
 the lower chamber 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.499
 pierre françois who would be to postpone for a day 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:25.700
 a flea market 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.930
 firstly again 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.860
 weather france ap it's done 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.100
 their research 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.789
 at closing 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.309
 because I know more who the benefit than the shots concretely on 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.309
 field 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.409
 they are horses 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.710
 - transport 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.330
 the future 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.770
 Sunday
