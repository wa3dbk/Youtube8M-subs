that<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.519> stereo<00:03:02.269> enhancer<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:04.120> not<00:03:05.120> present

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
that the stereo enhancer is not present

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.870 
that the stereo enhancer is not present
in<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.260> mono<00:03:06.470> version<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> mono<00:03:07.430> version

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
in the mono version and the mono version

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.240 
in the mono version and the mono version
is<00:03:08.000> panned<00:03:08.390> slightly<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.170> left<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.680> this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
is panned slightly to the left and this

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.850 
is panned slightly to the left and this
is<00:03:10.430> because<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:11.690> know<00:03:11.810> say<00:03:12.170> you're<00:03:12.350> recording

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
is because you know say you're recording

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.850 
is because you know say you're recording
two<00:03:13.400> acoustic<00:03:13.910> guitars<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.530> might<00:03:15.680> want<00:03:15.830> to

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
two acoustic guitars you might want to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.440 
two acoustic guitars you might want to
pan<00:03:16.040> one<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.459> left<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.850> Pam<00:03:17.060> one<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.330> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
pan one to the left and Pam one to the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.259 
pan one to the left and Pam one to the
right<00:03:17.630> rather<00:03:17.930> than<00:03:18.170> having<00:03:18.760> stereo<00:03:19.760> doubled

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
right rather than having stereo doubled

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.540 
right rather than having stereo doubled
on<00:03:20.390> both<00:03:20.630> sides<00:03:20.930> because<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.160> can<00:03:22.340> sound

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
on both sides because that can sound

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.259 
on both sides because that can sound
kind<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.000> muddy<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.450> mushy<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.470> gross<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.550> um

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
kind of muddy and mushy and gross so um

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.570 
kind of muddy and mushy and gross so um
so<00:03:27.230> yeah<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:27.680> here<00:03:27.890> we<00:03:27.980> go<00:03:28.100> we<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.280> the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
so yeah so here we go we have the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.920 
so yeah so here we go we have the
parametric<00:03:29.120> EQ<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:30.610> we<00:03:31.610> have<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.420> low<00:03:32.600> ends

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
parametric EQ and we have the low ends

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.319 
parametric EQ and we have the low ends
pretty<00:03:33.110> much<00:03:33.320> rolling<00:03:33.739> off<00:03:33.970> acoustic<00:03:34.970> guitars

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
pretty much rolling off acoustic guitars

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.539 
pretty much rolling off acoustic guitars
when<00:03:35.660> Mike<00:03:35.959> with<00:03:36.200> condenser<00:03:36.769> mics<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.370> did

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
when Mike with condenser mics like I did

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.229 
when Mike with condenser mics like I did
right<00:03:37.730> now<00:03:38.799> they<00:03:39.799> can<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.100> pretty<00:03:40.310> bassy<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.209> I

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
right now they can be pretty bassy so I

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.750 
right now they can be pretty bassy so I
rolled<00:03:41.660> off<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.110> low<00:03:42.560> end<00:03:42.769> here<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.220> little<00:03:43.610> bit

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
rolled off the low end here a little bit

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.650 
rolled off the low end here a little bit
more<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.420> next<00:03:44.750> one<00:03:44.930> up<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:46.299> just<00:03:47.299> a

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
more of the next one up and just a

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.900 
more of the next one up and just a
little<00:03:48.500> bit<00:03:48.650> off<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:48.860> mid<00:03:49.280> high<00:03:49.519> range

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
little bit off the mid high range

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.770 
little bit off the mid high range
frequencies<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:51.230> brought<00:03:51.769> up<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.130> highest

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
frequencies and brought up the highest

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.360 
frequencies and brought up the highest
quite<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> bit<00:03:54.079> so<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.709> we<00:03:54.920> can<00:03:55.070> have<00:03:55.190> some

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
quite a bit so that we can have some

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.430 
quite a bit so that we can have some
crispness<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:55.880> our<00:03:56.180> acoustic<00:03:56.420> next<00:03:57.109> we<00:03:57.230> have

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
crispness in our acoustic next we have

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.830 
crispness in our acoustic next we have
our<00:03:57.709> compressor<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.519> typically<00:03:59.359> like<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.630> do

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
our compressor I typically like to do

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.990 
our compressor I typically like to do
compression<00:04:00.500> after<00:04:00.680> EQ<00:04:01.280> we<00:04:01.519> had<00:04:01.640> just<00:04:01.790> some

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
compression after EQ we had just some

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.150 
compression after EQ we had just some
basic<00:04:02.420> compression<00:04:03.320> settings<00:04:03.709> since<00:04:03.980> I'm

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
basic compression settings since I'm

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.650 
basic compression settings since I'm
finger<00:04:04.489> picking<00:04:04.700> in<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.359> help<00:04:05.510> the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
finger picking in this to help the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.539 
finger picking in this to help the
levels<00:04:06.049> stay<00:04:06.500> pretty<00:04:06.739> consistent<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.370> can

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
levels stay pretty consistent you can

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.789 
levels stay pretty consistent you can
strum<00:04:07.910> with<00:04:08.150> these<00:04:08.660> compression<00:04:09.320> settings<00:04:09.680> if

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
strum with these compression settings if

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.440 
strum with these compression settings if
you<00:04:09.829> want<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.340> if<00:04:10.459> it's<00:04:10.609> too<00:04:10.790> strong<00:04:10.970> or<00:04:11.269> too

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
you want but if it's too strong or too

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.210 
you want but if it's too strong or too
hard<00:04:11.750> just<00:04:12.079> adjust<00:04:12.440> them<00:04:12.620> however<00:04:12.920> you'd<00:04:13.190> like

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
hard just adjust them however you'd like

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.930 
hard just adjust them however you'd like
a<00:04:13.400> stereo<00:04:14.239> enhancer<00:04:15.280> next<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:16.400> have<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.579> delay

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
a stereo enhancer next we have a delay

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.479 
a stereo enhancer next we have a delay
this<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.359> very<00:04:17.690> very<00:04:17.930> light<00:04:18.289> delay<00:04:18.680> it's<00:04:19.250> not

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
this is a very very light delay it's not

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.640 
this is a very very light delay it's not
necessary<00:04:20.329> but<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.630> kind<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:20.989> helps<00:04:21.200> fill<00:04:21.470> in

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
necessary but it kind of helps fill in

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.980 
necessary but it kind of helps fill in
some<00:04:21.890> stereo<00:04:22.310> gaps<00:04:22.700> here<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.240> there<00:04:23.390> so<00:04:23.750> I

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
some stereo gaps here and there so I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.409 
some stereo gaps here and there so I
like<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.770> add<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:24.919> there<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.640> then<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:26.060> very

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
like to add that there and then a very

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.950 
like to add that there and then a very
very<00:04:26.780> light<00:04:27.169> reverb<00:04:27.950> with<00:04:28.190> some<00:04:28.479> low-cut<00:04:29.479> you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
very light reverb with some low-cut you

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.290 
very light reverb with some low-cut you
know<00:04:30.080> cutting<00:04:30.770> out<00:04:30.979> some<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.400> low<00:04:31.580> next

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
know cutting out some of the low next

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.460

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.670 
sounds and T sounds for vocals I like
really<00:05:05.060> crisp<00:05:05.330> vocals<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.050> sometimes<00:05:06.440> those

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
really crisp vocals but sometimes those

TN<00:05:07.190> s<00:05:07.370> syllables<00:05:08.180> can<00:05:08.450> be<00:05:08.630> pretty<00:05:09.170> harsh<00:05:09.470> on

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
TN s syllables can be pretty harsh on

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.340 
TN s syllables can be pretty harsh on
the<00:05:09.920> ears<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:11.030> de-esser<00:05:11.600> helps<00:05:11.960> resolve

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350

I<00:05:38.090> used<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.930> parametric<00:05:39.440> EQ<00:05:39.800> it's<00:05:39.980> actually

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
I used a parametric EQ it's actually

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.410 
I used a parametric EQ it's actually
fairly<00:05:40.850> similar<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.110> acoustic<00:05:42.350> guitar

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
fairly similar to the acoustic guitar

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.050 
fairly similar to the acoustic guitar
the<00:05:44.420> only<00:05:44.450> difference<00:05:45.020> is<00:05:45.230> I<00:05:45.830> lowered<00:05:46.700> the

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
the only difference is I lowered the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.630 
the only difference is I lowered the
mids<00:05:47.390> just<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.990> little<00:05:48.260> bit<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:48.620> then<00:05:49.160> this

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
mids just a little bit and then this

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.520 
mids just a little bit and then this
frequency<00:05:50.270> right<00:05:50.810> here<00:05:50.960> I<00:05:50.990> couldn't<00:05:51.200> tell<00:05:51.380> you

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
frequency right here I couldn't tell you

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.010 
frequency right here I couldn't tell you
the<00:05:51.560> exact<00:05:52.010> placement<00:05:52.310> of<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:53.120> me<00:05:53.330> this

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
the exact placement of it to me this

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.900 
the exact placement of it to me this
frequency<00:05:54.350> sometimes<00:05:55.040> depending<00:05:55.490> on<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.640> mic

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
frequency sometimes depending on the mic

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.610 
frequency sometimes depending on the mic
will<00:05:56.510> make<00:05:56.690> your<00:05:56.870> voice<00:05:57.020> sound<00:05:57.290> really

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
will make your voice sound really

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.950 
will make your voice sound really
nasally<00:05:58.100> and<00:05:58.130> I<00:05:58.250> wanted<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.550> avoid<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.300> so<00:05:59.930> I

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
nasally and I wanted to avoid that so I

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.570 
nasally and I wanted to avoid that so I
brought<00:06:00.320> that<00:06:00.530> down<00:06:00.800> but<00:06:01.010> then<00:06:01.190> brought<00:06:01.430> the

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
brought that down but then brought the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.960 
brought that down but then brought the
highs<00:06:01.790> up<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.600> forest<00:06:02.990> high<00:06:03.230> end<00:06:03.500> up<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:04.250> gave

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
highs up the forest high end up and gave

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.600 
highs up the forest high end up and gave
us<00:06:05.120> some<00:06:05.150> real<00:06:05.540> crispness<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.320> then<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.220> added

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
us some real crispness and then I added

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.120 
us some real crispness and then I added
a<00:06:07.820> compressor<00:06:08.510> that<00:06:08.960> helps<00:06:09.260> make<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.620> vocal

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
a compressor that helps make the vocal

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.000 
a compressor that helps make the vocal
volumes<00:06:10.490> even<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.330> if<00:06:12.050> this<00:06:12.230> is<00:06:12.410> too<00:06:12.620> much<00:06:12.650> or

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
volumes even and if this is too much or

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.190 
volumes even and if this is too much or
too<00:06:13.130> little<00:06:13.160> compression<00:06:13.820> just<00:06:14.360> adjust<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.960> to

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
too little compression just adjust it to

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.100 
too little compression just adjust it to
make<00:06:15.830> it<00:06:15.950> sound<00:06:16.130> however<00:06:16.490> you<00:06:16.790> want<00:06:17.030> and<00:06:17.270> then

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
make it sound however you want and then

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.980 
make it sound however you want and then
spit<00:06:18.890> fish<00:06:19.160> which<00:06:19.790> is<00:06:19.940> our<00:06:20.090> de-esser<00:06:20.690> because

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
spit fish which is our de-esser because

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.610 
spit fish which is our de-esser because
after<00:06:21.320> the<00:06:21.440> compression<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.280> EQ<00:06:22.570> those<00:06:23.570> s<00:06:23.990> and

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
after the compression and EQ those s and

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.670 
after the compression and EQ those s and
T<00:06:24.860> syllables<00:06:25.580> are<00:06:25.760> pretty<00:06:26.030> harsh<00:06:26.300> so<00:06:26.690> lastly

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
T syllables are pretty harsh so lastly

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.940 
T syllables are pretty harsh so lastly
we<00:06:27.800> have<00:06:27.950> a<00:06:27.980> very<00:06:28.280> light<00:06:28.550> reverb<00:06:29.470> low<00:06:30.470> is<00:06:30.650> cut

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950

we have a very light reverb low is cut
pretty<00:06:31.340> high<00:06:31.820> because<00:06:32.240> you<00:06:32.870> don't<00:06:33.650> want<00:06:33.890> too

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
makes it sound really muddy

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
yeah that about sums it up one other

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.980 
yeah that about sums it up one other
thing<00:06:46.640> I'd<00:06:46.730> like<00:06:46.880> to<00:06:47.000> note<00:06:47.150> take<00:06:47.480> these<00:06:47.720> as<00:06:47.960> a
