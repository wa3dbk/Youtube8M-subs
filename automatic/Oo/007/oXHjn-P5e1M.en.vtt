00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
up there I don't think there's anything

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.130 
up there I don't think there's anything
really<00:01:29.860> John<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.430> we<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:31.030> look<00:01:31.810> at<00:01:31.930> it's

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
really John that we have to look at it's

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.530

something<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.830> other<00:01:33.150> bodies<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.420> got

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
something that the other bodies that got
