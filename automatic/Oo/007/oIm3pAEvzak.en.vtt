00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
months so in this case a weed whacker

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.520 
months so in this case a weed whacker
rock<00:00:50.640> came<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.600> hit<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.050> window

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
rock came in here and hit this window

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
rock came in here and hit this window
and<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:53.010> shattered<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.329> little

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and just shattered it all into little

and just shattered it all into little
pieces<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.829> course<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.280> did<00:00:56.430> not

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pieces but of course it did not

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.330 
pieces but of course it did not
disintegrate<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> decided<00:00:58.620> hey<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.309> use

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is shattered inside but I can put this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
is shattered inside but I can put this
tape<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.240> window<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> continue<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.830 
wondering where to buy it we sell it in
smaller<00:01:50.009> lengths<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.030> only<00:01:51.329> comes<00:01:51.689> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
smaller lengths because it only comes in
