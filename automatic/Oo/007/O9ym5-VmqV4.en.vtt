00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.189 

because<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:15.000> story<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> thought<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.870> reading

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
because the story I thought of reading

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.650 
because the story I thought of reading
this<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:16.529> hush<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.670> almost<00:00:18.060> feels<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
this was hush this almost feels like a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.640 
this was hush this almost feels like a
reverse<00:00:19.170> hush<00:00:19.590> hush<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> bunch<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.650> really

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
reverse hush hush is a bunch of really

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.400 
reverse hush hush is a bunch of really
loosely<00:00:23.160> connected<00:00:23.490> crap<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:25.140> doesn't

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
loosely connected crap on that doesn't

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
loosely connected crap on that doesn't
make<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> lot<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.769> sense<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.730> there's<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
make a lot of sense and then there's a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.939 
make a lot of sense and then there's a
somewhat<00:00:27.990> satisfactory<00:00:28.710> ending<00:00:30.560> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
somewhat satisfactory ending this is the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
somewhat satisfactory ending this is the
reverse<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.550> has<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> bunch<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> stuff<00:00:33.420> going

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
reverse this has a bunch of stuff going

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.069 
reverse this has a bunch of stuff going
on<00:00:34.579> that<00:00:35.579> feels<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.270> good<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.809> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
book it's basically the new origin for

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.609 
book it's basically the new origin for
two-phase<00:02:00.899> um<00:02:03.290> which<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> disappointing

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
two-phase um which is disappointing

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.590 
two-phase um which is disappointing
because<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:05.549> how<00:02:05.759> Batman<00:02:06.119> comics<00:02:06.479> are

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
because I know how Batman comics are

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.589 
because I know how Batman comics are
written<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:08.429> stories<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.910> hardly<00:02:09.479> ever

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
written and the stories like hardly ever

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.290 
written and the stories like hardly ever
going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.899> referenced<00:02:10.259> ever<00:02:10.470> again<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
going to be referenced ever again and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.650 
going to be referenced ever again and
that's<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.450> thing<00:02:12.599> that's<00:02:12.780> kind<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.230> on

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that's the thing that's kind of on

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.960 
that's the thing that's kind of on
because<00:02:14.530> basically<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.520> way<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.820> this

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
because basically the way that this

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.530 
because basically the way that this
story<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.390> done<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.810> set<00:02:17.050> up<00:02:18.000> anytime<00:02:19.000> two

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
story is done and set up anytime two

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.090 
story is done and set up anytime two
faces<00:02:19.990> origins<00:02:20.380> talked<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:20.800> should<00:02:21.010> be

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
faces origins talked about should be

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100 
faces origins talked about should be
this<00:02:21.310> because<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.090> technically<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> new

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
this because this is technically the new

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.160 
this because this is technically the new
origin<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.680> two<00:02:23.800> phase<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> thought<00:02:26.050> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
origin of two phase so I thought to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.020 
origin of two phase so I thought to
vases<00:02:26.470> appears<00:02:26.740> again<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.490> should<00:02:27.790> tie

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
vases appears again it it should tie

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.610 
vases appears again it it should tie
into<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.570> story<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.320> everything<00:02:29.590> that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
into this story like everything that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.050 
into this story like everything that
happens<00:02:29.920> before<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.460> store<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> toothpaste

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
happens before the store a toothpaste

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
happens before the store a toothpaste
should<00:02:31.870> no<00:02:32.020> longer<00:02:32.050> count<00:02:32.560> because<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:32.920> is

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
should no longer count because this is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.310 
should no longer count because this is
kind<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.240> rebirth<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.900> two-faced

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320

another<00:04:14.140> story<00:04:14.530> which<00:04:15.430> followed<00:04:15.790> up<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.060> this

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
another story which followed up on this

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.650 
another story which followed up on this
this<00:04:17.770> story<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.280> kind<00:04:18.609> of<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.880> me<00:04:19.030> completely

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
this story is kind of to me completely

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.260 
this story is kind of to me completely
pointless<00:04:20.430> because<00:04:21.430> basically<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.210> whole

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
pointless because basically the whole

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.120 
pointless because basically the whole
idea<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.780> psychologically<00:04:23.470> recreate<00:04:23.950> to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
idea is to psychologically recreate to

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.450 
idea is to psychologically recreate to
phase<00:04:25.860> but<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.130> cycle

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
phase but the cycle

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.710 
phase but the cycle
logically<00:04:27.759> creation<00:04:28.270> doesn't<00:04:28.509> matter

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
logically creation doesn't matter

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.670 
logically creation doesn't matter
because<00:04:29.020> no<00:04:29.289> one's<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.710> use<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:31.330> I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
because no one's going to use it this I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.590 
because no one's going to use it this I
mean<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:33.789> story<00:04:34.030> could<00:04:34.150> have<00:04:34.210> been<00:04:34.360> for

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
mean the story could have been for

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.219 
mean the story could have been for
issues<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.199> just<00:04:35.380> you<00:04:35.590> know<00:04:36.840> in<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.870> return

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
issues and just you know in the return

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.570 
issues and just you know in the return
of<00:04:38.259> to<00:04:38.500> face<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.830> didn't<00:04:39.009> have<00:04:39.099> to<00:04:39.190> tie<00:04:39.340> in<00:04:39.400> all

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
of to face it didn't have to tie in all

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.370 
of to face it didn't have to tie in all
these<00:04:39.699> other<00:04:39.880> villains<00:04:40.240> uh<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:41.349> the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
these other villains uh the the

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.260 
these other villains uh the the
strongest<00:04:42.130> here<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:45.250> thing<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.490> it's<00:04:45.940> well

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
strongest here the thing is it's well

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.140 
strongest here the thing is it's well
written<00:04:46.509> it's<00:04:47.229> good<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:48.130> just<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.000> end

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
written it's good it just in the end

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.409 
written it's good it just in the end
feels<00:04:49.419> kind<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.840> pointless<00:04:50.289> uh<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:52.030> one<00:04:52.240> thing

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
feels kind of pointless uh the one thing

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.089 
feels kind of pointless uh the one thing
that<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:52.630> thought<00:04:52.780> was<00:04:52.930> done<00:04:53.199> really<00:04:53.710> well<00:04:53.860> is

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
that I thought was done really well is

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.879 
that I thought was done really well is
there<00:04:54.250> is<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.610> thing<00:04:54.759> with<00:04:54.910> with<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.210> with

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
there is the thing with with the with

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.950 
there is the thing with with the with
Tim<00:04:56.889> Bruce<00:04:57.550> makes<00:04:57.759> Tim<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.180> son<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:58.720> all<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
Tim Bruce makes Tim and son and all that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.860 
Tim Bruce makes Tim and son and all that
and<00:04:59.319> that's<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.830> really<00:05:00.009> cool<00:05:00.099> I<00:05:00.870> really

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
and that's really really cool I really

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.110 
and that's really really cool I really
really<00:05:02.139> am<00:05:02.440> happy<00:05:02.800> with<00:05:03.039> that<00:05:03.160> stuff<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.639> I'm

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
really am happy with that stuff and I'm

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.060 
really am happy with that stuff and I'm
happy<00:05:04.539> with<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.840> toothpaste<00:05:05.229> stuff<00:05:05.530> it's

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
happy with the toothpaste stuff it's

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.710 
happy with the toothpaste stuff it's
just<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:06.610> feels<00:05:06.849> like<00:05:07.090> it's<00:05:07.300> set<00:05:07.539> up<00:05:07.599> for

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
just it feels like it's set up for

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.350 
just it feels like it's set up for
another<00:05:08.349> story<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.190> story<00:05:09.699> is<00:05:10.060> never

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
another story and that story is never

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.159 
another story and that story is never
going<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.660> get<00:05:10.810> written<00:05:11.080> uh<00:05:12.509> so<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.750> just<00:05:13.780> kind

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
going to get written uh so it just kind

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.700 
going to get written uh so it just kind
of<00:05:14.289> feels<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.800> don't<00:05:14.949> know<00:05:16.199> it's<00:05:17.199> just<00:05:17.380> really

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
of feels I don't know it's just really

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.350 
of feels I don't know it's just really
really<00:05:17.979> kind<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.460> underwhelming<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.150> think

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
really kind of underwhelming I think

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.969 
really kind of underwhelming I think
that's<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:19.720> whole<00:05:19.870> thing<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:23.560> worth<00:05:23.949> the

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
that's the whole thing it's worth the

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.089 
that's the whole thing it's worth the
reading<00:05:24.900> I'm<00:05:25.900> not<00:05:26.110> i<00:05:26.380> wouldn't<00:05:26.560> say<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:26.860> know

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
reading I'm not i wouldn't say you know

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.399 
reading I'm not i wouldn't say you know
immediately<00:05:27.280> go<00:05:27.580> out<00:05:27.699> and<00:05:27.849> buy<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:28.349> maybe<00:05:29.349> if

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
immediately go out and buy it maybe if

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.420 
immediately go out and buy it maybe if
you're<00:05:29.530> looking<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.889> two-faced<00:05:30.340> story<00:05:30.669> uh

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
you're looking for a two-faced story uh

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.810 
you're looking for a two-faced story uh
but<00:05:34.409> it's<00:05:35.409> really<00:05:36.330> underwhelming<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:38.820> it

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
but it's really underwhelming and it

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:48.379 
but it's really underwhelming and it
feels<00:05:40.389> more<00:05:41.130> what's<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.340> word<00:05:42.370> uh<00:05:46.050> feels<00:05:47.050> more

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
feels more what's the word uh feels more

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.860 
feels more what's the word uh feels more
ambitious<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:50.710> feels<00:05:50.949> really<00:05:51.190> ambitious<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
ambitious it feels really ambitious and

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.159 
ambitious it feels really ambitious and
i<00:05:53.080> just<00:05:53.229> don't<00:05:53.530> think<00:05:53.800> it<00:05:54.389> holds<00:05:55.389> up<00:05:55.690> because

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
i just don't think it holds up because

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.709 
i just don't think it holds up because
it's<00:05:56.409> a<00:05:56.500> standalone<00:05:56.830> story<00:05:57.310> maybe<00:05:58.090> if<00:05:58.300> like<00:05:58.630> I

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
it's a standalone story maybe if like I

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.510 
it's a standalone story maybe if like I
said<00:05:58.900> if<00:05:59.020> Robinson<00:05:59.320> was<00:05:59.590> was<00:05:59.919> planning<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.370> do

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
said if Robinson was was planning to do

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.010 
said if Robinson was was planning to do
a<00:06:00.550> sequel<00:06:00.969> and<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.240> should<00:06:01.389> never<00:06:01.509> happened

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
a sequel and that should never happened

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.800 
a sequel and that should never happened
like<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:02.860> that<00:06:03.130> that<00:06:03.419> baby<00:06:04.419> would<00:06:04.659> make

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
like that that that baby would make

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.870 
like that that that baby would make
sense<00:06:05.050> but<00:06:05.710> this<00:06:05.860> really<00:06:06.009> feels<00:06:06.219> like<00:06:06.430> this<00:06:06.820> is

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
sense but this really feels like this is

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.659 
sense but this really feels like this is
build<00:06:07.300> up<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:09.070> we<00:06:09.159> never<00:06:09.280> going<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.520> pay<00:06:09.639> off

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
build up and we never going to pay off

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.999 
build up and we never going to pay off
we<00:06:09.969> never<00:06:10.150> got<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.360> second<00:06:10.870> story<00:06:11.050> to<00:06:11.620> face<00:06:11.770> just

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
we never got a second story to face just

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.209 
we never got a second story to face just
dropped<00:06:12.370> off<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.699> map<00:06:12.820> for<00:06:13.120> years<00:06:14.099> and<00:06:15.099> then

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
dropped off the map for years and then

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:16.290 
dropped off the map for years and then
when<00:06:15.310> he<00:06:15.370> came<00:06:15.520> back<00:06:15.580> there<00:06:15.969> was<00:06:16.060> no<00:06:16.120> reference

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
when he came back there was no reference

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.120 
when he came back there was no reference
to<00:06:16.570> this<00:06:16.719> story<00:06:17.020> really<00:06:17.229> it<00:06:17.440> was<00:06:17.560> just<00:06:17.590> oh<00:06:17.919> it's

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
to this story really it was just oh it's

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.730 
to this story really it was just oh it's
two<00:06:18.340> phase<00:06:18.550> I<00:06:18.849> was<00:06:19.780> like<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.020> story<00:06:20.259> it's<00:06:20.530> like

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
two phase I was like the story it's like

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.170 
two phase I was like the story it's like
