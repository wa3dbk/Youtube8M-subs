00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 you count his friends and cordial 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.050
 welcome to a warface tutorial for 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.660
 Windows 8.1 users always have 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.360
 the problem that their mouse movement 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.510
 not made me stay even 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.060
 I can try if I can promise 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.369
 a hideaway how are you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.510
 it's my house back and forth and the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.050
 Movement just does not stay the same 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 I keep the same movement so he 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 say high c i dont mean mine now 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.200
 the left and right down now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.559
 no problem only left and right so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.760
 the x-axis affected 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.850
 to fix this problem, I'll show you 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 now very briefly 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.850
 let's go 1000 for a moment 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 play on desktop means the game must 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.270
 I record so go there now on a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.730
 program likes it a bit 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.309
 push away part mouse man one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.670
 recorder we open it now completely 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.130
 Shortly with her, a mouse movement pays 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.130
 everything recognized 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.740
 and if you 're a casual exploiter 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.870
 you have to frequency everything that way 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.340
 Do not behave commercially 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.600
 what does she do with her but that 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.800
 movement and therefore always the same 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 now a nice job 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.720
 the movement with everything the same 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 even we can aim like that again 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.400
 without you so mausklicks to you quite 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.400
 change quickly 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.760
 what have you got left now? 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.390
 a comparison again which purpose 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.660
 and how fast is it then go 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.780
 here 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.330
 then it's just very fast now 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.390
 publicly again a mouse in the recorder 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:49.830
 and set the motion all 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 even so super was already in the game 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.630
 so it is still a very fast 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.630
 dissolve in order to recorders 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.340
 without mouse movement recorder old fast 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.110
 movement is just the problem in the beginning 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 because the slow is something but then 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.830
 here at the end 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.989
 ok I hope you have fun with this 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.290
 had tutorial and us someday 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.290
 later
