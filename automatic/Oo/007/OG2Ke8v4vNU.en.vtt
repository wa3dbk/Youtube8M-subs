00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.590
 Hello my name is still dominated and I show you videos around the topic 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.949
 Mac OS 10 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.619
 Today I would also like to tackle the topic 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.069
 Mack down 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:18.629
 NTFS is a file system used primarily under Windows 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.609
 many external hard drives also looks partially formatted before 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.089
 and can buy something like that when he buys them now in the trade and your Mac 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.310
 Percent are needed 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.800
 what I am building but has noticed 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 some new macs when you get home lot 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.140
 Hard disk connects to the formatted with the daycare centers 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.970
 Mountain Tigers working on the desktop is the Mac 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.430
 basically from the version 10 6 I know what newly integrated natively 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.510
 but not unlocked this opportunity I want today 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.339
 do not show 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.760
 because there is one 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 small extension of a software here is free 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.620
 and is called MAK 4 USD 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.690
 I'm going to Safari 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 and search Google for MAK use 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.540
 and of course I think so too 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.250
 under 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.570
 Dr at Google, of course 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.039
 and the up 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.049
 Downloads and load them often warmer 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.049
 under 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.570
 and that's very well a Retriever talk 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.500
 pressebox has been released in version 4 0 8 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.750
 but I need the seats here now 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.900
 so 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.700
 here is my way use 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 Install at Kapsch by double-clicking 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.490
 I follow the whole accept the license 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 Hillmann password once 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
 then I can always close the image 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:14.189
 Installation was successful I throw the image out of her Mac 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.389
 and I have now 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.549
 in the system settings an extension of the Heist Maki guys 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.489
 the system settings are in 64-bit mode 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.819
 started and used up black 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.909
 it has to be used once in 32-bit mode, that's why it comes 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.729
 Message is okay too 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.129
 stands here 32 bits 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.409
 I can here 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.209
 once after 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.139
 look for Abba now can not beta version while dazzle 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.139
 I do not really need it 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.189
 then finally formatted a usb-stick on the middle nccs 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.189
 is 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.409
 and me he gets on the desk 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.159
 murdered I've got some pictures of 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.239
 under 7 the standard wallpaper 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.349
 as in Windows 7, but now played on it 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.750
 because I also put the stick under 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.819
 created our virtual machine Windows 7 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.609
 So formatted 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.480
 and if the information looks at me then the format is that 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.959
 where does it come from, that is the topic he lowers tennis 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.329
 What I can not do is write 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.329
 I can only read from this contained before him 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.669
 and that should suffice so far first I know there is still 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.019
 additional tools 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.420
 but the writing also rewards it possible 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.520
 there is another possibility that in a special video there is yes 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.269
 the hot scene there you can 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.409
 Windows exchange much better even big ones 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.249
 around 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.989
 Format hard drives it's not just samples four gigabytes or so 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.679
 then the possibility to save only four gigabytes of files old 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.189
 less than four gigabytes 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.159
 But the food there is because if exFAT but do it 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.279
 old video 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.910
 as was you can only read here 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.910
 I can even try what happens if I want to write on it 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.529
 Holiday with me not at all 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.840
 so and now I always start mine 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 virtual machine 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.909
 everything I see here I did not see as my other videos 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.510
 just watch a channel 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.919
 there is a video 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.039
 Â»Economy Oaks with Windows 7 Elber logical 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.689
 where do you get that how do you do that i explain it in a channel 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.699
 so 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.440
 then with you now 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.460
 now rose 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.460
 the windows machine I'm throwing out 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.069
 and now you are here the Windows machine available 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.240
 I have the MTF Test Ruiss to thick and of course I can read it here 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.569
 describe on it 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.439
 Regions Explorer view the properties of the 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.569
 the hot scenes 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.569
 he notes 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.330
 I throw but Windows again out of me is the usb-stick now under Mac again 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
 to disposal 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.830
 yes the software is called Mac Dios 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.719
 Just enter Google 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.690
 the link post I also under it where in the nuclear plant it gets 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.560
 in my view right now a mastalerz one aspect software 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.650
 I would in your place "If I need to succeed woman needs 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.879
 dispense a commercial software here 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.289
 There are commercial software that allows writing too 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.830
 but I have not read a lot of positives about it myself 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.610
 do not use that because I say consistently if someone files with me 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.569
 There are other possibilities 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.449
 I definitely do not need a zodiac golden boy for Windows 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.819
 is able to 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.820
 So write and synonymous other file systems 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.240
 too big hard drives 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.710
 other part system to use as NTFS 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.699
 yes that was it until the next time
