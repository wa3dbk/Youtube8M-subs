now<00:00:20.400> my<00:00:20.520> thought<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.359> actually

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
now my thought for this was to actually

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.000 
now my thought for this was to actually
try<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> bit<00:00:22.410> more<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> higher

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
try and get a bit more of a higher

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
try and get a bit more of a higher
scoring<00:00:23.400> gameplay<00:00:23.880> who's<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.449> course<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
scoring gameplay who's of course the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.939 
scoring gameplay who's of course the
previous<00:00:25.080> game<00:00:25.230> players<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.619> I've<00:00:25.710> shown

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
previous game players that I've shown

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
previous game players that I've shown
were<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.250> team<00:00:26.490> deathmatch<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.180> team

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
were all team deathmatch and in team

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.790 
were all team deathmatch and in team
deathmatch<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.769> high

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
deathmatch you can really go for as high

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
deathmatch you can really go for as high
scoring<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.310> plays<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> thought<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.660> I

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
scoring game plays so I thought that I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
scoring game plays so I thought that I
would<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.960> simply<00:00:31.140> try<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.740> some

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
would just simply try out some

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
would just simply try out some
domination<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:33.030> after<00:00:33.360> playing<00:00:33.390> 6v6

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
domination now after playing 6v6

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930 
domination now after playing 6v6
domination<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> little<00:00:35.370> while<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> figured

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
domination for a little while I figured

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.250 
domination for a little while I figured
out<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> definitely<00:00:37.050> not

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
out that that is definitely not

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
out that that is definitely not
something<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.829> me<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.790> too

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
something for me it's a little bit too

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
something for me it's a little bit too
slow<00:00:39.210> pace<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> ask<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> actually

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
slow pace if you ask me so I actually

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
slow pace if you ask me so I actually
tried<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.370> ground<00:00:41.640> war<00:00:41.910> played<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tried out some ground war played a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.389 
tried out some ground war played a
couple<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.050> games<00:00:43.110> came<00:00:43.559> across<00:00:43.800> Yemen<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
couple of games came across Yemen and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.830 
couple of games came across Yemen and
actually<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> gameplay<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> just

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
actually got this gameplay and I just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
actually got this gameplay and I just
felt<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.469> needed<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> show<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> guys<00:00:47.340> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
felt like I needed to show you guys this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
felt like I needed to show you guys this
gameplay<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.570> near<00:00:48.719> future<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.170> will<00:00:49.320> still

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
peacekeeper but I'm actually pretty sure

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
peacekeeper but I'm actually pretty sure
that<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> scores<00:00:53.850> won't<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> standards

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that the scores won't be up to standards

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
that the scores won't be up to standards
to<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> be

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
to this one but I'm actually going to be

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.279 
to this one but I'm actually going to be
trying<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> swarm<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.719> every<00:00:58.020> single

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
trying to get a swarm on every single

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
map because today I actually equipped

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.860 
map because today I actually equipped
this<00:00:59.789> room<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> first<00:01:00.420> time<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> never

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
this room for the first time I never

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
this room for the first time I never
equip<00:01:01.379> those<00:01:01.559> swarms<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.550> simply

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
equip those swarms because I simply

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
equip those swarms because I simply
don't<00:01:03.120> try<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> challenge<00:01:03.809> myself<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.470> hated

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
don't try to challenge myself I hated

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
don't try to challenge myself I hated
when<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.070> died<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:05.760> Plus<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.540> going

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
when I died one off Plus what I'm going

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300 
when I died one off Plus what I'm going
for<00:01:06.840> higher<00:01:07.110> kill<00:01:07.350> streaks<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.710> usually<00:01:08.040> tend

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
for higher kill streaks I usually tend

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.859 
for higher kill streaks I usually tend
to<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.580> into<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> mindset<00:01:09.180> where<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to get into that mindset where I want to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.719 
to get into that mindset where I want to
play<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.350> carefully<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.520> from

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
play very carefully where I go from

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
play very carefully where I go from
cover<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> cover<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.510> personally<00:01:12.900> don't

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
cover to cover and I personally don't

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
cover to cover and I personally don't
really<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> course<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.909> be

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
really like that but of course I will be

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
really like that but of course I will be
trying<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.420> those<00:01:15.630> swarm<00:01:15.869> gameplays<00:01:16.290> for

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
trying to get those swarm gameplays for

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.929 
trying to get those swarm gameplays for
you<00:01:16.619> guys<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> course<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.759> also

you guys because of course I can also
put<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.360> some<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.720> effort<00:01:19.110> than<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.320> usually

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
put in some more effort than I usually

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 
put in some more effort than I usually
do<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.430> anyway<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:20.970> video<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.479> to

do but anyway in this video I want to
quickly<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.020> over<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> class<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> was

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
quickly go over the class that I was

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.740 
quickly go over the class that I was
using<00:01:23.369> areas<00:01:23.820> gameplay<00:01:24.240> enough<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
using areas gameplay enough that the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
using areas gameplay enough that the
score<00:01:25.049> streaks<00:01:25.320> set<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.799> well<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.729> first

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
score streaks set up as well so first

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.550 
score streaks set up as well so first
off<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.299> using<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> peacekeeper<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.470> the

third free dexterity wildcards overkill

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
third free dexterity wildcards overkill
because<00:01:38.159> I'm<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.549> using<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> dsr-50<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
because I'm actually using the dsr-50 as

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
because I'm actually using the dsr-50 as
my<00:01:40.350> second<00:01:40.799> primary<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.520> actually

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
my second primary because I actually

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.030 
my second primary because I actually
made<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.270> class<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> map<00:01:43.079> downhill<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
made this class for the map downhill and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
made this class for the map downhill and
of<00:01:44.159> course<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.700> said<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.240> for

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
of course like I said it was going for

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
of course like I said it was going for
DLC<00:01:45.780> map<00:01:46.229> gameplays<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.250> actually<00:01:47.340> use

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
DLC map gameplays and I actually use

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.130 
DLC map gameplays and I actually use
this<00:01:47.820> class<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.270> downhill<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:48.869> I'm

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
this class on downhill because I'm

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.450 
this class on downhill because I'm
downhill<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
downhill you have kind of like that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.520 
downhill you have kind of like that
triangle<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.210> death<00:01:51.420> where<00:01:51.899> there's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> window

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
triangle of death where there's a window

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.840 
triangle of death where there's a window
and<00:01:52.710> every<00:01:52.920> single<00:01:53.189> side<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> map<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and every single side of the map on the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
and every single side of the map on the
left<00:01:54.119> side<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:54.840> side<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
left side on the right side in the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620 
left side on the right side in the
middle<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> DSR<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> get

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
middle and I actually use the DSR to get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.359 
middle and I actually use the DSR to get
rid<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> people<00:01:58.049> camping<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.799> those<00:01:58.950> windows

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
rid of people camping in those windows

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.010 
rid of people camping in those windows
so<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> definitely<00:02:00.450> something<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
so that is definitely something that you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.179 
so that is definitely something that you
should<00:02:01.110> try<00:02:01.500> out<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.829> near<00:02:01.950> future

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
should try out in the near future

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.219 
should try out in the near future
whenever<00:02:02.579> you're<00:02:02.969> playing<00:02:03.149> downhill<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
whenever you're playing downhill of

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.080 
whenever you're playing downhill of
course<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> other<00:02:04.829> wildcard<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.610> perd<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
course the other wildcard is perd to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
course the other wildcard is perd to
creed<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:07.049> my<00:02:07.170> score<00:02:07.469> streak<00:02:07.680> setup<00:02:07.950> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
creed and then my score streak setup and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
creed and then my score streak setup and
it's<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.489> very<00:02:08.520> simple<00:02:08.789> scores<00:02:09.390> reset

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it's actually very simple scores reset

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.950 
it's actually very simple scores reset
up<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> orbital

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
up you have the orbital

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.900 
up you have the orbital
he<00:02:11.020> said<00:02:11.260> after<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.860> Loadstar<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.790> then

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
he said after that the Loadstar and then

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.670 
he said after that the Loadstar and then
of<00:02:13.030> course<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.390> swarm<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> hardest<00:02:14.560> part

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
of course the swarm now the hardest part

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.470 
of course the swarm now the hardest part
is<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.100> actually<00:02:15.460> get<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.880> orbital<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.360> he

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
is to actually get the orbital if he

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.420 
is to actually get the orbital if he
said<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> usually<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.590> notice<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.310> course

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
said what I usually do notice of course

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
said what I usually do notice of course
like<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> said<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.180> start<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> video<00:02:19.780> when<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> go

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
like I said to start a video when I go

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.350 
like I said to start a video when I go
for<00:02:20.650> high<00:02:20.800> killstreak<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.880> tend<00:02:22.180> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
for high killstreak I kind of tend to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.850 
for high killstreak I kind of tend to
play<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.600> little<00:02:22.900> bit<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.230> careful

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
play a little bit more careful

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.590 
play a little bit more careful
I<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:24.310> from<00:02:24.460> cover<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.850> cover<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.390> once<00:02:25.510> you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
I go from cover to cover and once you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.910 
I go from cover to cover and once you
actually<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.260> view<00:02:26.440> set<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.800> can

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
actually get that view set you can

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.260 
actually get that view set you can
afford<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.310> rush<00:02:27.460> around<00:02:27.580> because<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.000> course

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
afford to rush around because of course

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.060 
afford to rush around because of course
you<00:02:28.450> know<00:02:28.660> where<00:02:28.810> all<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.140> enemies<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
you know where all the enemies are you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.130 
you know where all the enemies are you
can<00:02:30.250> simply<00:02:30.640> priam<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.150> pre<00:02:31.540> fire<00:02:31.780> every

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
can simply priam and pre fire every

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.810 
can simply priam and pre fire every
single<00:02:32.440> time<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.400> course<00:02:33.580> going

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
single time and that is of course going

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.460 
single time and that is of course going

that<00:02:38.470> love<00:02:38.740> star<00:02:39.010> right<00:02:39.220> away<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:40.000> game

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
that love star right away and this game

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.000 
that love star right away and this game
play<00:02:40.420> actually<00:02:40.660> failed<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.410> my<00:02:41.590> second

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
play actually failed to get my second

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.140 
play actually failed to get my second
low<00:02:42.130> star<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.460> that's<00:02:42.580> because<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> actually

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
low star and that's because I actually

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.210 
low star and that's because I actually
got<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.630> when<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.810> was<00:02:43.990> in<00:02:44.140> my<00:02:44.290> first<00:02:44.650> load<00:02:44.950> star

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
got it when I was in my first load star

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.010 
got it when I was in my first load star
and<00:02:45.610> if<00:02:45.700> you're<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.000> your<00:02:46.120> first<00:02:46.360> low<00:02:46.660> star<00:02:46.900> you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
and if you're in your first low star you

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.720 
and if you're in your first low star you
won't<00:02:47.290> be<00:02:47.440> able<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.800> get<00:02:48.070> your<00:02:48.190> second<00:02:48.610> low

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
won't be able to get your second low

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.520 
won't be able to get your second low
star<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.450> whenever<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.810> get<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.110> chance<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
star so whenever you get the chance to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.200 
star so whenever you get the chance to
call<00:02:50.710> that<00:02:50.860> bad<00:02:51.070> boy<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.790> sure<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.000> do

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
call that bad boy and then be sure to do

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.090 
call that bad boy and then be sure to do
so<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.630> would<00:02:52.870> recommend<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.680> do<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.890> right

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
so I would recommend you to do it right

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.710 
so I would recommend you to do it right
away<00:02:54.370> after<00:02:54.580> your<00:02:54.820> orbital<00:02:55.150> fee<00:02:55.330> set<00:02:55.540> it's

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
away after your orbital fee set it's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.270 
away after your orbital fee set it's
going<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.320> make<00:02:56.470> sure<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.920> don't

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
going just to make sure that you don't

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.790 
going just to make sure that you don't
lose<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.820> second<00:02:58.240> low<00:02:58.390> star<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.350> did<00:02:59.560> in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
lose that second low star like I did in

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.710 
lose that second low star like I did in
this<00:03:00.010> gameplay<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:00.910> anyway<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.300> was<00:03:01.360> just

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
this gameplay but anyway this was just

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.970 
this gameplay but anyway this was just
the<00:03:01.840> second<00:03:02.230> half<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.560> thought<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.920> would

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the second half I thought that I would

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.590 
the second half I thought that I would
simply<00:03:03.250> show<00:03:03.580> this<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.790> little<00:03:03.970> bit<00:03:04.180> because<00:03:04.330> of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
simply show this a little bit because of

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.000 
simply show this a little bit because of
course<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.050> first<00:03:05.260> round<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.650> was<00:03:05.770> playing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
course in the first round I was playing

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.830 
course in the first round I was playing
just<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:06.670> bit<00:03:06.760> too<00:03:07.000> defensively<00:03:07.570> I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
just a little bit too defensively I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.440 
just a little bit too defensively I
think<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.380> got<00:03:08.560> 27<00:03:09.190> or<00:03:09.310> 28<00:03:09.640> kills<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.210> first

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
think I got 27 or 28 kills in the first

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.880 
think I got 27 or 28 kills in the first
five<00:03:10.660> minutes<00:03:10.900> which<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.500> course<00:03:11.530> been

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
five minutes which would of course been

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.100 
five minutes which would of course been
incredibly<00:03:12.550> boring<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.270> look<00:03:13.420> at<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.080> I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
incredibly boring to look at so I

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.300 
incredibly boring to look at so I
thought<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.470> would<00:03:14.590> simply<00:03:14.800> show<00:03:15.130> these

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
thought that I would simply show these

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.920 
thought that I would simply show these
second<00:03:15.700> half<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.030> keep<00:03:16.210> everything<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.660> a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
second half to keep everything just a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.690 
second half to keep everything just a
little<00:03:16.960> bit<00:03:17.320> more<00:03:17.530> entertaining<00:03:17.980> but<00:03:18.490> anyway

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
little bit more entertaining but anyway

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.430 
little bit more entertaining but anyway
