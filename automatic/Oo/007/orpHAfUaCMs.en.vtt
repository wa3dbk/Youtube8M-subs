00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
shampoo has no sulfates in it so it's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800

rebellious<00:04:02.470> hair<00:04:02.709> which<00:04:02.949> I<00:04:03.069> would<00:04:03.220> definitely

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
rebellious hair which I would definitely

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.039 
rebellious hair which I would definitely
say<00:04:03.879> Fitz<00:04:04.840> might<00:04:05.139> do<00:04:06.209> because<00:04:07.209> even<00:04:07.690> though<00:04:07.840> it

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
say Fitz might do because even though it

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.140 
say Fitz might do because even though it
does<00:04:08.290> behave<00:04:08.560> itself<00:04:08.859> a<00:04:09.010> lot<00:04:09.159> of<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.340> time<00:04:09.519> it

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
does behave itself a lot of the time it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.479 
does behave itself a lot of the time it
could<00:04:10.389> become<00:04:10.690> quite<00:04:10.840> dry<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.470> quite<00:04:12.190> messy

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
could become quite dry and quite messy

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.819 
could become quite dry and quite messy
so<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.510> would<00:04:13.720> definitely<00:04:13.810> say<00:04:14.199> my<00:04:14.229> hair<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.739> on

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
the dry side and this is just really

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.099
