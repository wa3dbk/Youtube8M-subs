00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hi, I'm here today for 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.940
 unpack a new boxing with you 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.330
 box for me that I received because I got it 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.080
 won by playing a game on 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.800
 page exactly of this site of which vi 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.699
 I'll put the directions on the info box 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.500
 both of the site and of the facebook page 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.760
 so far as I know this a product 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 that I don't know that I never have 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.000
 received but to what I understand this 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.840
 box which as you see is very pretty and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
 nice 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 with this box slightly with the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.910
 lightly padded lid that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.270
 unfortunately I imagine for carelessness of the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.960
 couriers arrived with 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 unfortunately, with broken corners 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.340
 I will try to repair it and reuse it 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.990
 because as you see this box is 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:05.150
 cute I open now with you not 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.790
 I know what to expect because 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.920
 just as you see one never received not 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.810
 I know this product so now I do 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.550

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.740
 black question to the content in the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.800

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.840
