00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.380
 of yeast 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.380
 a little bit 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 and now we incorporate a 0% yogurt in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.570
 skim fat 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.610
 this is a white mark that now good 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.799
 of chocolate as I'm going to teach you 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.810
 do others and it's pretty much the same thing what 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.340
 The only thing that changes is the taste. 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.189
 bring chocolate is a little bit more 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 bitter and you're going to need a spoonful 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.729
 for dessert more than yeast all these 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.539
 ingredients the new goods for 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.539
 make a homogeneous paste 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.420
 when it is already moved 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.840
 I added two eggs that I already have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.840
 milkshakes 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.550
 and I do it well 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.110

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.750
 fire I have the two molds prepared 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.210

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.040
 I have tried many silicone 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.840
 better you have some and you get 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.570

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.810
 I have caught the point and they are fair 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 three minutes but in the position you can go 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.790
 trying it is preferable that you put it 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.310
 less time and when you see how it is 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.570
 which is consolidated then is 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.700
 perfect that you see is a little 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.860
 softer so it connects and gave minutito 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.310
 more than that and you are taking the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.790
 point I put it in the micro and I wait three 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.790
 minutes 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.850
