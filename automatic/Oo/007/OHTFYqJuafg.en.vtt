00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
bumps you tend to get so you can this is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
bumps you tend to get so you can this is
um<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.420> detangling<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> could

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
um this detangling in here you could

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.569 
um this detangling in here you could
have<00:01:47.009> done<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.159> before<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.090> after<00:01:48.810> i<00:01:49.310> choose<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
have done it before or after i choose to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.440 
have done it before or after i choose to
do<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> after<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:53.700> doesn't<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.180> matter

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
