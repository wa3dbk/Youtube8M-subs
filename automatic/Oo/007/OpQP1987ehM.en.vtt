um I again take your punched image of a
yellow<00:00:49.210> tone<00:00:49.450> again<00:00:49.750> this<00:00:49.870> one<00:00:50.079> happens<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.560> be

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
yellow tone again this one happens to be

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.300 
yellow tone again this one happens to be
barely<00:00:50.980> banana<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.950> to<00:00:54.070> go<00:00:54.190> ahead

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
barely banana and I'm going to go ahead

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.690 
barely banana and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:54.640> score<00:00:55.420> from<00:00:56.200> top<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.680> bottom<00:00:56.950> in<00:00:57.460> each

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
and score from top to bottom in each

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.720 
and score from top to bottom in each
petal<00:00:58.060> so<00:00:58.300> I'm<00:00:58.360> going<00:00:58.630> from<00:00:58.810> the<00:00:59.730> approximate

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
petal so I'm going from the approximate

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.330 
petal so I'm going from the approximate
center<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.300> one<00:01:01.600> of<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.840> petals<00:01:02.110> down<00:01:03.010> in

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
center of one of the petals down in

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.610 
center of one of the petals down in
between<00:01:03.760> petals<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.960> I'm<00:01:05.019> going<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.229> do<00:01:05.439> that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
between petals and I'm going to do that

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.980 
between petals and I'm going to do that
five<00:01:05.890> times<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.970> gonna<00:01:07.060> go<00:01:07.270> ahead<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.510> turn

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
five times I'm gonna go ahead and turn

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
five times I'm gonna go ahead and turn
it<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.620> get<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.790> next<00:01:10.000> petal<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:11.080> score<00:01:12.070> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it to get to the next petal and score it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.300 
it to get to the next petal and score it
the<00:01:13.360> next<00:01:13.750> petal<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.470> score<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:14.920> again<00:01:15.130> from

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
the next petal and score it again from

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.950 
the next petal and score it again from
the<00:01:15.370> top<00:01:15.520> middle<00:01:16.150> down<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.780> crease<00:01:18.960> turn

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
the top middle down to the crease turn

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.750 
the top middle down to the crease turn
it<00:01:20.170> again<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.290> these<00:01:23.860> don't<00:01:24.159> have<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:24.580> be

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
it again and these don't have to be

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.390 
it again and these don't have to be
exact<00:01:25.570> science<00:01:26.080> this<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.620> just<00:01:27.010> going<00:01:27.280> to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
exact science this is just going to

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.990 
exact science this is just going to
allow<00:01:28.360> for<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.320> little<00:01:29.500> bending<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.670> flower

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
allow for a little bending of the flower

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.149 
allow for a little bending of the flower
and<00:01:31.780> we're<00:01:32.020> breaking<00:01:32.380> down<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.560> fibers<00:01:33.130> of

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
and we're breaking down the fibers of

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.600 
and we're breaking down the fibers of
the<00:01:33.400> card<00:01:33.790> stack<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.619> hopefully<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:36.190> can<00:01:36.400> see

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the card stack so hopefully you can see

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.820 
the card stack so hopefully you can see
those<00:01:36.820> lines<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.510> go<00:01:37.690> through<00:01:37.990> each<00:01:38.290> one<00:01:38.320> of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
those lines that go through each one of

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.270 
those lines that go through each one of
them<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.750> me<00:01:40.930> what<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:41.530> did<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.220> took

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
them and for me what I did is I took

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.990 
them and for me what I did is I took
this<00:01:42.670> brown<00:01:42.970> pencil<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.430> just<00:01:45.700> kind<00:01:45.909> of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
this brown pencil and and just kind of

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.620 
this brown pencil and and just kind of
followed<00:01:46.360> those<00:01:46.570> groove<00:01:46.960> lines<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.850> doesn't

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
followed those groove lines it doesn't

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.830 
followed those groove lines it doesn't
show<00:01:49.810> up<00:01:50.020> really<00:01:50.439> predominantly<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:51.549> on<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
show up really predominantly on on the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840 
show up really predominantly on on the
flower<00:01:53.080> when<00:01:53.409> we're<00:01:53.590> done<00:01:53.799> but<00:01:54.460> there's<00:01:54.670> just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
flower when we're done but there's just

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.120 
flower when we're done but there's just
something<00:01:55.150> about<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.260> kind<00:01:56.680> of<00:01:56.830> helps

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
something about this that kind of helps

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.429 
something about this that kind of helps
give<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.580> little<00:01:58.119> extra<00:01:58.420> definition<00:01:58.840> from

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
give it a little extra definition from

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:09.029 
give it a little extra definition from
the<00:01:59.530> inside<00:02:01.140> okay<00:02:03.600> missing<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.960> am<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:08.039> can

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
the inside okay missing one I am go can

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.250 
the inside okay missing one I am go can
I<00:02:09.069> get<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.429> one<00:02:09.639> in<00:02:09.669> there<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.659> think<00:02:10.749> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
I get that one in there and I think the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.440 
I get that one in there and I think the
pencil<00:02:11.650> also<00:02:11.829> helps<00:02:12.249> break<00:02:12.489> down<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.849> fibers

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
pencil also helps break down the fibers

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.290 
pencil also helps break down the fibers
my<00:02:15.450> rich<00:02:15.660> Razzleberry<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.980> daughter<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.710 

used<00:02:21.300> as<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> straightedge<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:25.250> very<00:02:26.250> lightly

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
used as a straightedge and very lightly

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.660 
used as a straightedge and very lightly
start<00:02:27.720> from<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.989> center<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.530> work<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:29.640> way

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
start from the center and work my way

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.000 
start from the center and work my way
out<00:02:29.849> towards<00:02:30.690> each<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.170> end<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.500> each<00:02:31.680> petal

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
out towards each the end of each petal

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.610 
out towards each the end of each petal
and<00:02:32.819> just<00:02:33.300> keep<00:02:33.480> going<00:02:33.810> until<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.290> get<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and just keep going until you get the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.330 
and just keep going until you get the
graduation<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> color<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.270> like<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
graduation of color that you like I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.000 
graduation of color that you like I
think<00:02:38.340> we'll<00:02:38.489> go<00:02:38.610> ahead<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.850> stop<00:02:39.270> there<00:02:40.010> I've

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
think we'll go ahead and stop there I've

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.229 
think we'll go ahead and stop there I've
seen<00:02:41.310> another<00:02:43.340> technique<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.400> they<00:02:44.730> used<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
seen another technique that they used a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.080 
seen another technique that they used a
q-tip<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.739> went<00:02:46.980> through<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.850> well

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
q-tip and they went through that as well

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.960 
q-tip and they went through that as well
and<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:49.680> me<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.069> just<00:02:50.100> didn't<00:02:50.670> necessarily

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
and for me I just didn't necessarily

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.170 
and for me I just didn't necessarily
care<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.160> or<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.220> didn't<00:02:53.489> work<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:53.640> me<00:02:53.880> so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
care for it or it didn't work for me so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.420 
care for it or it didn't work for me so
I<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:55.170> pencil<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.769> kind<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.250> that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
I the pencil and I kind of like that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.900 
I the pencil and I kind of like that
definition<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.390> gave<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.459> I'll<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.700> one

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
definition that it gave so I'll have one

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.030 
definition that it gave so I'll have one
little<00:03:00.060> spot<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.900> guy<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> wanted

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
little spot on this guy here so I wanted

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.030 
little spot on this guy here so I wanted
to<00:03:02.100> show<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.670> q-tip<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.560> maybe<00:03:04.739> if<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to show you the q-tip and maybe if the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.949 
to show you the q-tip and maybe if the
q-tip<00:03:05.459> was<00:03:05.670> fresh<00:03:05.970> every<00:03:06.330> time<00:03:06.360> it'd<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.930> a

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
q-tip was fresh every time it'd be a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.830 
q-tip was fresh every time it'd be a
little<00:03:07.140> different<00:03:08.150> I'm<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.390> ink<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
little different I'm going to ink the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.970 
little different I'm going to ink the
edges<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:15.140> then<00:03:16.140> I'm<00:03:16.380> going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.590> come<00:03:16.799> back

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
edges and then I'm going to come back

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.660 
edges and then I'm going to come back
and<00:03:17.220> I'm<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.670> fold<00:03:18.829> along<00:03:19.829> those<00:03:20.280> score

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
and I'm going to fold along those score

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.349 
and I'm going to fold along those score
lines<00:03:20.700> again<00:03:21.329> on<00:03:21.480> each<00:03:21.720> petal<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.609> again<00:03:24.239> I'm

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
lines again on each petal so again I'm

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.930 
lines again on each petal so again I'm
folding<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.959> here<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:26.340> are<00:03:26.519> just<00:03:26.730> what

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
folding it here and these are just what

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.979 
folding it here and these are just what
the<00:03:27.090> crease<00:03:27.359> lines<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.109> made<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:30.840> it

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
the crease lines that we made and do it

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.330 
the crease lines that we made and do it
on<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:31.410> five<00:03:31.880> petals<00:03:33.769> see<00:03:34.769> how<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.070> kind<00:03:35.310> of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
on all five petals see how that kind of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.979 
on all five petals see how that kind of
makes<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.700> pliable<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.540> then<00:03:37.500> I'm<00:03:37.980> kind<00:03:38.370> of

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
makes it pliable and then I'm kind of

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.300 
makes it pliable and then I'm kind of
cupping<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.440> bit<00:03:40.590> between<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.950> two

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
cupping it a little bit between the two

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.460 
cupping it a little bit between the two
hand<00:03:41.579> my<00:03:41.760> two<00:03:41.820> hands<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.510> squishing<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.230> in

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
hand my two hands and squishing it in

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.770 
hand my two hands and squishing it in
and<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:44.459> kind<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.850> gives<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.450> little<00:03:45.690> bit

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
and that kind of gives it a little bit

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.740 
and that kind of gives it a little bit
of<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.109> dimension

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
of a dimension

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.670 
of a dimension
okay<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:48.810> then<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.859> go

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
okay so then this is going to go

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.470 
okay so then this is going to go
alongside<00:03:52.680> up<00:03:53.190> here<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:53.910> now<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.060> would<00:03:54.180> have

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
alongside up here so now I would have

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.140 
alongside up here so now I would have
three<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:55.049> pansies<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.010> made<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:59.150> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
three little pansies that I made and to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.960 
three little pansies that I made and to
make<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.540> leaves<00:04:01.459> some<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.760> who<00:04:02.940> are

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
make the leaves some of you who are

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.910 
make the leaves some of you who are
following<00:04:03.359> me<00:04:03.420> will<00:04:03.690> probably<00:04:03.989> be<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.530> sick<00:04:04.769> of

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
following me will probably be so sick of

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.630 
following me will probably be so sick of
seeing<00:04:04.980> me<00:04:05.310> make<00:04:05.489> these<00:04:05.700> please

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
seeing me make these please

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.720 
seeing me make these please
but<00:04:07.210> this<00:04:07.330> is<00:04:07.450> an<00:04:07.600> inch<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.080> old<00:04:08.320> Orlick<00:04:08.860> that

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
but this is an inch of old Orlick that

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.140 
but this is an inch of old Orlick that
I'm<00:04:09.820> just<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:11.770> know<00:04:11.830> folding<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.460> half<00:04:12.490> and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
I'm just you know folding in half and

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.900 
I'm just you know folding in half and
I'm<00:04:13.990> not<00:04:14.230> worried<00:04:14.560> about<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.950> being<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.220> perfect

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
I'm not worried about it being a perfect

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.870 
I'm not worried about it being a perfect
fold<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.390> could<00:04:16.660> take<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.170> on<00:04:17.320> my<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:18.430> know<00:04:18.579> and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
fold I could take it on my you know and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.150 
fold I could take it on my you know and
score<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.480> real<00:04:19.780> nice<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.230> pretty<00:04:20.440> but<00:04:20.560> I'm

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
score it real nice and pretty but I'm

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.680 
score it real nice and pretty but I'm
going<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.430> turn<00:04:21.760> right<00:04:22.000> around<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.390> run<00:04:22.570> it

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
going to turn right around and run it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.560 
going to turn right around and run it
through<00:04:22.720> my<00:04:22.930> crimper<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:24.360> quite<00:04:25.360> honestly

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
through my crimper so quite honestly

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.770 
through my crimper so quite honestly
it's<00:04:26.170> I<00:04:26.530> like<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.910> as<00:04:28.060> much<00:04:28.210> texture

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
it's I like it to have as much texture

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
it's I like it to have as much texture
as<00:04:29.020> wet<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.620> at<00:04:29.800> this<00:04:29.950> point<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:32.470> like<00:04:32.620> a

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
as wet and at this point just like a

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.500 
as wet and at this point just like a
nice<00:04:33.190> long<00:04:33.430> strip<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.030> because<00:04:34.240> I'm<00:04:34.360> going

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
nice long strip of it because I'm going

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.850 
nice long strip of it because I'm going
to<00:04:34.570> be<00:04:34.660> making<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.230> lot<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.620> leaves<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:38.440> again

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to be making a lot of leaves but again

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.340 
to be making a lot of leaves but again
folded<00:04:39.310> in<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> half<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.120> then<00:04:40.330> I'll<00:04:40.930> cut<00:04:41.320> out

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
folded in a half and then I'll cut out

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.420 
folded in a half and then I'll cut out
half<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:42.010> leaf<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.360> on<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.630> crease<00:04:43.900> edge<00:04:44.430> so

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
half a leaf do it on the crease edge so
