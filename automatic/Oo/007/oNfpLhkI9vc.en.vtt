00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
crack below the clay layer I didn't seem

crack below the clay layer I didn't seem
to<00:03:21.340> find<00:03:21.640> anything<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.900> significance<00:03:23.310> in

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
to find anything of significance in

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.020 
to find anything of significance in
there<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.970> fortunately<00:03:26.129> so<00:03:27.129> I'm<00:03:27.700> going<00:03:27.760> to

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
there and fortunately so I'm going to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.420 
there and fortunately so I'm going to
hit<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.599> flood<00:03:29.440> layer<00:03:29.769> there<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:33.190> can

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
see the difference when it changes from

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:50.460 
see the difference when it changes from
black<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:47.190> ok<00:03:48.190> who's<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.209> area<00:03:49.989> I've<00:03:50.230> been

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
black to ok who's the area I've been

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.789 
black to ok who's the area I've been
working<00:03:51.010> when<00:03:51.310> i<00:03:51.340> was<00:03:51.700> with<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.959> he<00:03:53.109> was

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
working when i was with just and he was

working when i was with just and he was
behind<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.489> nozzle<00:03:55.060> he<00:03:55.180> found<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.629> big

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
behind the nozzle he found that big

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.199 
behind the nozzle he found that big
piece<00:03:56.349> right<00:03:56.769> in<00:03:57.010> here<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:59.819> there's<00:04:00.819> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
piece right in here and there's the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.520 
piece right in here and there's the
other<00:04:01.329> outside<00:04:02.079> corner<00:04:02.709> there<00:04:03.040> here's<00:04:03.609> ours

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
other outside corner there here's ours

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.870 
other outside corner there here's ours
so<00:04:05.530> we're<00:04:06.630> working<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.470> good<00:04:09.099> area<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.700> would

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
so we're working in a good area I would

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.900 
so we're working in a good area I would
figure<00:04:10.859> but<00:04:12.690> see<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.930> black<00:04:14.290> there<00:04:14.910> it's

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
figure but see that black there it's

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.050 
figure but see that black there it's
black<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.660> gray<00:04:17.019> play<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:21.250> pretty<00:04:21.549> easy<00:04:21.820> to

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
black and gray play it's pretty easy to

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.980 
black and gray play it's pretty easy to
go<00:04:22.330> through<00:04:22.660> it's<00:04:22.870> about<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.289> 23<00:04:24.190> inch<00:04:24.220> layer

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
go through it's about a 23 inch layer

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.730 
go through it's about a 23 inch layer
and<00:04:26.700> there's<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.419> drill<00:04:28.750> holes<00:04:29.139> from

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
and there's one of the drill holes from
