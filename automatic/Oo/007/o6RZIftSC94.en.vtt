the<00:02:56.980> Corgi<00:02:57.750> dominated<00:02:58.750> Turkey<00:02:59.620> was<00:02:59.800> just<00:02:59.950> kind

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.890 
think the combination of the horsey
sauce<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.090> Thousand<00:03:07.090> Island<00:03:07.420> gave<00:03:07.569> kind

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
of a spicy sweet thing going on there I

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.150 
of a spicy sweet thing going on there I
kind<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.780> don't<00:03:11.260> get<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.500> toasty

part of the bread the bread was just

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.550 
part of the bread the bread was just
kind<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.810> soggy<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.470> whatever<00:03:16.410> kind<00:03:17.410> of

conflicted<00:03:18.099> about<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.519> sandwich<00:03:19.019> tasted

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
conflicted about this sandwich tasted

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.600 
conflicted about this sandwich tasted
pretty<00:03:20.170> good<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.209> lots<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.260> meat<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.920> very

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
pretty good kind of lots of meat so very

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.820 
pretty good kind of lots of meat so very
hearty<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.420> still<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.900> expensive<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
hearty but still a little expensive the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.580 
hearty but still a little expensive the
breads<00:03:27.130> not<00:03:27.310> great<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.660> think<00:03:28.930> if<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.410> weigh

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
breads not great so I think if you weigh

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.949 
breads not great so I think if you weigh
all<00:03:29.830> those<00:03:30.069> factors<00:03:30.549> together<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.660> can't

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
all those factors together you can't

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.920 
all those factors together you can't
really<00:03:32.260> get<00:03:32.500> too<00:03:32.799> much<00:03:33.100> above<00:03:33.519> 1/2<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.690> thumb

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
really get too much above 1/2 of a thumb

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.490 
really get too much above 1/2 of a thumb
up<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.470> sort<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.769> effort<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:38.200> know<00:03:38.290> I'm

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
up for that sort of effort you know I'm

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.539 
up for that sort of effort you know I'm
going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.709> eat<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.010> I'm<00:03:39.130> actually<00:03:39.280> probably
