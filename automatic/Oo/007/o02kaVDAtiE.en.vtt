00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.810
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.870
 the website 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 puntocom remind you that we are 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 learning to handle the lack of sweet 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.279
 endo to bring that that performance 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.430
 those lessons that we have learned to 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.640
 handling what is a pointer a 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.849
 traditional Galician letter that finances 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 joining well let's go with the first part 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.840
 of our song that we have prepared 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.960
 it is not that it has been prepared is that it is the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.570
 which is always used to start 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.270
 learn especially in the area of 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.510
 RÃ­as Baixas 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.080
 and the first part of the song that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.350
 let's learn what a paso doble is 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.150
 the next we will be covering 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.410
 correctly all the fingers and the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.410
 first part is like this 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.890
 with the repeat I'll repeat it about three 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.780
 times for you to follow me and that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.780
 let's take the first part 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.899
 Y 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.810
 as I observe it made a chopped 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.690
 we can make at the moment 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.090
 we come more comfortable but there 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.270
 melodies in which the chopped carries 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.200
 embedded in what is the melody we're going 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.920
 to repeat again the first part 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.920
 what would this be 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840
 ah 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.670
 well once we have this part 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.709
 prepared we will go to the next one 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.789
 next video where we will continue 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.789
 developing this song
