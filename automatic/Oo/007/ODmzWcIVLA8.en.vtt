00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 I'm Well really a chance encounter something called sax for me, but the middle that happens 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:41.860

 It was a moment when I was in the volume of a voice bridge 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 Anyway , the key is fun but the theory is fun 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.250
 I felt like going to school with that worthlessness 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.960
 Positive Good luck wants to be with me 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.620

 I'm in the forehead and now I 'm doing this kind of work 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.650
 Just when I entered university I got the instrument that I had at that time, a 99 also 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.520

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:31.700
 Anyway, one by one person anymore much use the instrument without cheating decided that it is this is more even 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.280
 I think there will be a lot better if there is a thing called a more and more new ones 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.960
 I think that divided the type to try to find two 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.690
