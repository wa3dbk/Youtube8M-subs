00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.710
 And then check out another video blog in the air. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.140
 this week talking about the subject more 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.180
 commented that it was the 200 with the rival in the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.340
 final table tournament at 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.960
 to be in seventh the sixth I said that 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.059
 let riverside john 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 everybody's stayed the year everybody doubts 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.170
 however here precisely to explain 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.239
 this controversy explains my line of 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.040
 reasoning on top of that 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.710
 Everybody knows that I'm a guy who 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.870
 controls very br and put a volume 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.760
 big enough so we can 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.769
 put in the long run small details 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.650
 really where you moments you 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.970
 can really save will make the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.920
 difference ahead 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.909
 in my case everyone also knows that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.269
 I'm a guy who works a lot 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.860
 comfortable with stec with 20 30 blaise 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.439
 So you 're playing a tournament in 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.229
 pokerstars is has two types of tournament 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.040
 with ribba and have those tournaments that 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.320
 example 200 is with unlimited ribba that the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.950
 two thousand chips and for example without the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.530
 r 100 in 2011 is a spectrum is 3 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.860
 thousand chips and every time put the period 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.660
 de derry by usually is in neighborhood 75 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.140
 to 150 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.180
 then 3,000 chips is believed to be 20 blinds 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.980
 is a little tight, but the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.670
 from there you went from the system of 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.470
 4 thousand for me does not exist, I have 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 more expensive investment for the long 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.620
 I will always be investing in the long term. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.590
 a 30 with ribba and 30 dollars being that the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.970
 icms is everyone knows 120 and 150 mine 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.800
 vote will be higher on top of this 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.810
 putting the volume that I 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.390
 I do the day to day and saving this 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.710
 neighborhood is 1 being that it is important 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.770
 remember that I'm a guy I can 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.400
 play quietly and eztec of 30 25 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.769
 Patients who gives me is to get to the 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.299
 tournament itself this difference of 30 light 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.030
 which is the value of lyon that the value of a 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.549
 Recess is it really will not do 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.650
 difference in the decision I believe the tournament 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.959
 and it will hardly change the world for 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.020
 these barrels to more or less situations 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.560
 end up being unavoidable and 30 more 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.280
 for you 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.050
 for me it really is a margin 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.880
 extremely comfortable carrying 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.860
 My account is thinking a little bit like 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.420
 you have to think about the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.099
 How much are you investing? How much are you investing? 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.920
 Are you having a comeback then you? 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.540
 able to make this neighborhood economy 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.120
 You can do this count 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.190
 blas port with 30 there I'm comfortable 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.860
 I do not need a neighborhood, I do not need 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.170
 edson for sure this is personal but it does 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.209
 part of our technique and with certainty 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.680
 You saved a lot of money and that makes 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.900
 with my ray raise 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.459
 considerably against this volume 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.239
 so big that we always go 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.790
 print out 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.890
 so this is it guys watch and stay 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
 always attentive to details details 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.540
 really make a difference to who 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.790
 put the volume and this is another detail 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.799
 a tip that I 'm going through and explaining 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.890
 closing this controversy I hope that 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.480
 Do you understand, use this to your advantage. 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.980
 I see a lot of people doing it because 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.769
 really worth saving 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.900
 quite big and that's what I said too 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.430
 Until the next video blog continue 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.709
 Sending the questions I 'll be here 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.000
 always worth the dylan that we 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.000
 we see on the tables hug
