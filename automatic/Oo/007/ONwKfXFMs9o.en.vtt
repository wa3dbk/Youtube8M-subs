00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.850
 openwork point in two needles 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 let's see how this point is made 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.480
 openwork on the needles that is so pretty 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.540
 they can use it on the garment that 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 want even if they do it in a thread 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.689
 well thin that looks like a lace 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.390
 spectacular thick for a char me 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.420
 speaks of a scarf putting about 10-15 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.120
 points, leaving a beauty 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.220
 Stitch is not reversible by right 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.430
 It looks very even but this design 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.350
 you only see on the right side 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.649
 must always kill or mount points 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.649
 multiples of 7 plus a necessary point 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.399
 so that the stitch fits perfectly 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.020
 in this opportunity I made 22 points the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.680
 our has as you see it in a size 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.089
 very good has 22 points that are three 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.729
 motives 1 2 and 3 reasons plus the point 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.009
 necessary for it to be very good is 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.649
 convenient to make it with thin wool and 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.229
 with the needles a little thicker 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.320
 these races already ahead but 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.170
 let's pretend that I 'm here 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.560
 riding 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.620
 the 22 points and we are going for the race 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.110
 No. 1 knits 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.860
 step by step you do the following 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 way a right point this point 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.850
 right is done only once on the side 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.150
 of the right in career number 1 to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.480
 then we make a three loop 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.120
 points together these three points the 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.570
 we do introducing the needle by 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:57.040
 front of the point that three points together 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.040
 at a right point 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.380
 one loop and four points at one point 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.950
 right one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.950
 two 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.849
 and 4 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.769
 that 's the first reason for this 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.769
 point face let's repeat it 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.590
 a loop 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.870
 points together at a right point see 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.770
 as I told them by inserting the needle 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.500
 here by the front of the point and we take out 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.220
 the needle like this 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.670
 one loop and four points at one point 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.670
 straight 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320
 two 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.790
 and 4 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.470
 there we finish another reason we go for the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.430
 last a lasso three stitches together in 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.430
 a right point 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.270
 one loop and four points at one point 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.870
 right one 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.870
 two 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.980
 and 4th and the first race ends 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.290
 for the second on the wrong side 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.590
 Race number two on the wrong side 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.770
 it's very easy to do everything from beginning to 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.770
 end in a reverse point like that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.319
 I pass the thread over, I enter the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.170
 needle below and 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.439
 he must turn around and take out the thread we are going to 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.200
 do it all over the race again so 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.659
 let's do 10 slowly so that 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.450
 remember how the point of the 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.719
 backwards and in this case as I told you 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.620
 the whole race from beginning to end 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:05.739
 in a reverse point we go for the race 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.049
 number 4 on the right side 4 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.049
 points in a right point 1 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.630
 two 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.880
 of 4 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.490
 next I make a loop three 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.800
 points together at a right point 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.340
 remember to put the needle in the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.340
 front 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.670
 and a loop there ends the first reason 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.480
 let's repeat it four points right 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.580
 If there is any doubt please enter my 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.070
 page how to knit dotcom and are the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.550
 written instructions for this stitch 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.510
 of all those that I teach baa1 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.950
 two 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:57.240
 three and four points at a right point 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:00.110
 a lacing three stitches together in a 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.110
 right point 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:09.180
 and a loop and the last four motive 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.780
 points one rights 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.780
 two 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:23.830
 4 a lacing three stitches together in a 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.830
 right point 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:31.669
 a loop and a right point that is and 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:34.610
 the last point of the race number 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.669
 three the next is on the side of the 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.370
 reverse all the races on the side of the 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.949
 backwards we do them exactly the same as 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.219
 the number two that are all at one point 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.110
 reverse finish career number four 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.020
 on the reverse side 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.780
 that's the whole stitch of this point 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.970
 pierced do not forget the stitch 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.940
 they have four races that are two times 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.380
 the right and two for the reverse after 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.980
 this you repeat again the 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.570
 race number one two three and four 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.820
 as many times as necessary for 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.980
 the length of the garment you need and what 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.040
 same frame the multiples points of 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.930
 seven that you need for the width of the 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.390
 of the garment that they are going to weave and 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.790
 add an additional point go to my 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.920
 page how to knit dotcom will find 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.920
 some videos as pretty as this one
