00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 Tell me guys, I 'm fine in the area. 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
 Welcome to the channel today bringing you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.119
 more news more news about the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.820
 movie 4 in specific customizations and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.500
 vehicles galera and a very good news 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.660
 for who uses the tank as their weapon 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.119
 your main vehicle the better. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.600
 saying that the ammunition will really be 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.860
 limited but it recharges the 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.420
 automatically then a good news 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.430
 for those who use the tank as a vehicle 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 The main thing is that the ammunition 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 reload automatically and already 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 We're talking about the tank. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
 let's go to the customization of the own 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.840
 tank in a primary galley 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 we have the 120mm shell up to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 that gun that shoots right at your 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 opponent does not need to locke 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.289
 second option we have the shell is a load 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.960
 in the shape of a cannon fired by the tank 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.899
 main or a lower speed and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.810
 causes heavy damage when used against 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.320
 armored targets in a second area 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.780
 we have the coaxial lng that that light 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.090
 Very good machine gun against 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.000
 infantry but does not cause any damage 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.520
 against armored personnel finds the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720
 People have a choice, it's only smoke that is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.590
 very good for those missiles 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.140
 guided those trim itself 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.869
 comes you can inhibit this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 attack using a tuxedo and even up 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.310
 even when that guy comes with those 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 and four you can confuse the mind 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 the guy using smoke would be a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.670
 camouflage more air into the tank and optical 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 we have an optical zoom in updates we fear 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.189
 maintenance on it and to finalize the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.180
 here in the options you have for the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.700
 Pilot is snapple camouflage paint has 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.149
 Various colors have various camouflage to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.880
 you choose your screened - in option 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.850
 to win we have a great time to win 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.190
 which is the night vision and sound galley 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.170
 very good and for the win now I do not know 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.330
 explain to you if you are going to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.830
 machine gun for a win but I believe that 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.260
 will have but beauty 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.110
 and to end the win we also have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.870
 upgrade for the win that the only one that 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 has available is the next scanner 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.480
 now we go here for helicopters 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.410
 my primary weapon we have the hydra op 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620
 postage 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.980
 is a system that can versatile capable of 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.640
 draw in fancy as well as armor 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.520
 light and heavy and have zone roque 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.040
 pottes that are slower mightiest 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840
 rockets anti infantry then it here 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.570
 I think it's just to use against 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.930
 infantry, its effectiveness is against 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.840
 infantry in secondary areas we have 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.020
 sic hits that what there needs to locar 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.320
 only on air vehicles nec 2006 that you 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.970
 can only put on the ranch and in 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.700
 against the measure we only have 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.830
 the flash is available but certainly more 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.070
 go ahead with more points you can 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.830
 also release the beauty dianmu in 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.220
 update has a stanza that acne 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.430
 bi or delayed the locke time a bit 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.470
 in your helicopter and paintings or 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.410
 color or various dyes 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.440
 camouflage there but the options one has 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.880
 above is all pro pilot now an option 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.100
 per win 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.290
 there is a second area for gain in 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.600
 option has only one option that I save 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.500
 missile but surely they will put 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 also the tv that is much used in games 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.239
 in optics to win has a sound and vision 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.390
 and updates 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.269
 we have only the loud louder that that 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.019
 mechanism that increases the speed of 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:58.890
 reloading your weapons beauty and 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.739
 to finish the pots right to a primary 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.830
 for the boat we have the 30 millimeters 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.010
 Explosive shell show that causes damage 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.430
 heavy against infantry and armored 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.410
 Lightweight and we have burst shell says to 10 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.410
 rounds of 20 milliliters explosives 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.269
 with destruction against 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.570
 aircraft or other armored vehicles 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.610
 Light 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.330
 so these two guys here is for use 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.630
 of lightweight beauty vehicles and is a second 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.510
 part 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:36.290
 we have the boat tgma3 I call customs 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.080
 anti-tank which causes enormous damage to the 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:43.340
 heavily armored and infantry within 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.960
 of the blast radius then if you have any 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.480
 like infantry repairing tank 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.720
 surely die also then that the 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.350
 It gm will be a good option for those who want 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.990
 is to destroy beauty tanks and the second 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.210
 option of a second area we have the missile 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.880
 anti-aircraft he told me what you 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.770
 needs anti-aircraft to drop and 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.210
 find measure for the boat 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.930
 the boat have here ô ô ô smoke in great has 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.660
 an optical zoom and theme updates 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.140
 maintenance also what will happen if 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.810
 automatically repairing your boat 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.460
 beauty that leads then this video is only 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.180
