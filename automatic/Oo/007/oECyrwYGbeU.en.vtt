00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.819 

I<00:00:25.130> don't<00:00:25.550> like<00:00:25.669> that<00:00:26.199> almost<00:00:27.199> kind<00:00:27.529> of<00:00:27.589> sounds

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
I don't like that almost kind of sounds

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.650 
I don't like that almost kind of sounds
like<00:00:27.859> an<00:00:28.039> engine<00:00:28.339> awk

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.340 

I<00:00:34.690> don't<00:00:35.410> but<00:00:36.370> if<00:00:36.490> you<00:00:36.550> can<00:00:36.670> hear<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.880> ticking

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.760 

however<00:00:41.920> see<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.050> only<00:00:44.170> does<00:00:44.290> it<00:00:44.470> like

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
however see but it only does it like

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.150 
however see but it only does it like
where<00:00:44.950> it<00:00:45.070> will<00:00:45.280> go<00:00:45.900> around<00:00:46.900> and<00:00:47.200> I'll<00:00:47.320> go<00:00:47.470> like

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
where it will go around and I'll go like

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.130 
where it will go around and I'll go like
normal<00:00:49.000> no<00:00:49.150> sound<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:49.570> then<00:00:49.690> I'll<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:49.900> tick

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
normal no sound and then I'll go tick

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.400 
normal no sound and then I'll go tick
tick<00:00:50.290> tick<00:00:50.440> tick<00:00:50.760> tick<00:00:51.760> tick<00:00:52.690> tick<00:00:52.840> tick<00:00:52.990> so

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick so

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.560 
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick so
I'm<00:00:53.620> thinking<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.430> do<00:00:54.520> it<00:00:54.640> by<00:00:55.060> timing<00:00:55.510> I

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
I'm thinking that to do it by timing I

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.850 
I'm thinking that to do it by timing I
still<00:00:55.780> haven't<00:00:55.990> pulled<00:00:56.170> these<00:00:56.380> two<00:00:56.620> things

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
still haven't pulled these two things

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.600 
still haven't pulled these two things
off<00:00:57.100> here<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.700> here<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.660> check<00:00:58.900> it<00:00:59.050> but<00:01:00.010> I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
off here and here to check it but I

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.750 
off here and here to check it but I
think<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.150> do<00:01:01.239> with<00:01:01.270> my<00:01:01.450> timing

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.050 

hopefully<00:01:06.010> someone<00:01:07.010> on<00:01:07.130> YouTube<00:01:07.490> can<00:01:07.700> tell<00:01:07.970> me

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
hopefully someone on YouTube can tell me

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.990 
hopefully someone on YouTube can tell me
what<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:09.370> so<00:01:10.370> I<00:01:10.400> can<00:01:10.820> whether<00:01:11.060> or<00:01:11.240> not<00:01:11.330> know

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
what it is so I can whether or not know

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.560 
what it is so I can whether or not know
if<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:14.380> something<00:01:15.380> really<00:01:15.410> bad<00:01:16.040> or<00:01:16.970> if<00:01:17.390> it's

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
if it's something really bad or if it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.230 
if it's something really bad or if it's
something<00:01:17.810> not<00:01:18.710> really<00:01:19.100> -<00:01:19.340> too<00:01:19.730> much<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.030> worry

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
something not really - too much to worry

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.970 
something not really - too much to worry
about<00:01:21.940> try<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.060> maybe<00:01:23.990> loosen<00:01:24.320> up<00:01:24.500> my<00:01:24.620> license

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
about try and maybe loosen up my license

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.130 
about try and maybe loosen up my license
so<00:01:25.130> I'm<00:01:25.190> trying<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.460> be<00:01:25.550> easier<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.390> car
