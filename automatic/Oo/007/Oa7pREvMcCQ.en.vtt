00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hi, this is Sergio Ricardo, doctor. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.330
 Sales Okay, I've prepared this video 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.790
 to meet a great friend she asked 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 my opinion on a sentence that the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.949
 heard 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.779
 She wanted to know my position and I 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.660
 I was very happy to receive a request for 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.930
 be able to help much respect girlfriends 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 she asked about the impacts generated 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.859
 when the seller asks the customer 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.369
 buy because he has to hit a 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.110
 At the moment this phrase reminds me of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.340
 some situations are many of them 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.710
 that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 once I went to a store I started to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.140
 be requested by a seller in the middle of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 customer service arrived and made 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 signal to be answered I arrived at a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.110
 shampoo signal started the customer did 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.079
 a bored face did not like the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.180
 way I said the neo provider may 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 meet both at the same time in total 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.270
 national 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.549
 the player replied no need not 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.500
 that other person he is a customer 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.729
 ancient is one of the best 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 He can wait I was in shock. 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 How is it? 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.630
 that way that salesperson 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.189
 treating your best customers was 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 that way he well understood and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.700
 then thrive but through 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 contempt waiting 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 I understood that this is what most 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.829
 happens to customers 9 all charm 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 to the old and the faithful but any way 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.320
 der while this approach is very 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 wrong does not generate long-term 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 term 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 I believe that the relationship is like 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 a little plant that we have to take care of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.060
 which always water in the right measure 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 only then put in the shade or wet 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.659
 very few 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.450
 but in the right measure I believe in 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.520
 win-win relationship where the two parties 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 have to have the perception of gains 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.969
 one of the parties on the perception of 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.010
 loss 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.040
 the partnership the relationship 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.080
 our decline begins to break down and when 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.020
 the relationship begins to lose itself 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.750
 attention begins to diminish and foul space 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.820
 for another love you've heard that one 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 sentence that says that who does not give 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.110
 assistance loses preference opens the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.940
 competition and suffers the consequences 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 So I think we 're going to do the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.890
 possible to build a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.750
 lasting relationship where everyone has a 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.020
 perception that they are gaining in 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.570
 relationship and now back to the beginning of 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.710
 conversation of our conversation I wanted to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.500
 that you discovered when the seller 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.960
 asks the customer to buy the purchase plus one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.730
 to hit the target will be that the 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.730
 councilor is building a relationship 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.800
 win-win with the customer 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.240
 the seller he is creating a relationship 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.420
 the two sides gain the focus is on 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.590
 customer or lack alê 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.070
 I believe that some clients may 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.989
 Until we think our help should be 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.910
 selling too little to ask for help 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.150
 but who won with it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.190
 if I help the lion that and I thought 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.970
 this company was a good idea is hardly the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.519
 legs 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.500
 I'll be careful not to hurt myself. 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.050
 or easy to start making a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.130
 his competitor when he breaks 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.769
 one looked good could happen 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.170
 I believe I would use other approaches 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.040
 generating a perception of gain in the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.070
 client 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.050
 Imagine only a company well chubb nor 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.680
 means business to business where a 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.300
 company sells to other companies 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.550
 say you are a supplier of 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.920
 products to a store where the customer 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.519
 always buy from this supplier 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.100
 You're a good example for us to generate 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.040
 an increase in product mix means 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.190
 increase the sale of different products 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.660
 on the same client as your client 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.180
 I saw that your order did not several pieces of the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.280
 product x 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.909
 - dogs that buy these products 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.650
 I usually buy the product and also 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.459
 not near the other side in your 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.350
 store 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.930
 I'll include some boxes of the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.759
 product that works from a product 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.949
 close to the other and whenever the customer 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.960
 order the product x take the rich product 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.770
 money and take it soon you will too. 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.190
 need 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.100
 What, then, was the Lord your 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.199
 customer 10 product boxes that 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.440
 You would rather get 15 puppies than 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.110
 it is better to offer you always two 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.229
 possibilities within the two fast 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.970
 It 'll even be a great time for you. 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.669
 opportunity because it helped the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.590
 the client has the perception of gain 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.199
 it was a business for him 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.020
 I will now give an example of an increase in 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.800
 amount of sale of the same product 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.530
 to the same building your customer analyzes 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.900
 your order and see that you lose 10 boxes of 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.310
 product x looks only this product has been 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.979
 accepts very large 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.449
 I'll give you a tip from you that product 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.610
 sells very well 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.860
 attracting customers to your store and 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.930
 general cash flow 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.680
 some of our customers that more 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.780
 sell purchases are increasing in 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.800
 about 50 percent to purchase this 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.990
 product 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.130
 they are using it as bait to attract 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.169
 more customers and sell other products 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.740
 taking care of the quantity 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.650
 prefers will also increase the purchase 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.889
 of this product and 50% or prefer to start 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.750
 with 20% increase is best to help 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.970
 attracting more customers sold the others 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.020
 products that you evaluate both 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.889
 important 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.270
 the first is that you should know 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.580
 what are you talking about 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.990
 must understand the potential of each 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.580
 product synergy among them 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.120
 complementarity means when a 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.159
 product complements the other second 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.659
 tell the truth of your customer 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.000
 I remember that in this case the company 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.400
 supplier of products to sell 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.889
 always to choose then it has to be 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.229
 clear and true 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.509
 if the customer realizes that he is not 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.759
 earning what drew me to him 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:30.229
 better relationship competitor will 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:32.629
 government should seek alternatives to 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.789
 generate solutions for them 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:37.969
 those without perceived gains and 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:42.319
 based on this to generate the leverage of 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:43.849
 results right here I give opinion I 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.409
 I said that you asked the customer to buy 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:51.199
 to hit the goal is much more 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:53.060
 damaging the relationship with the customer will 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.580
 light a red light in the mind of 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.759
 customer about possible difficulties 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.930
 vendor company veils 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.509
 I also believe that many sellers 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.370
 who use this argument has no 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:08.270
 been touched and if possible from the 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:11.689
 folding in the minds of children can 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.610
 find it bad right consultants 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.409
 holds in companies so that they 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.779
 leverage your sales 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:21.050
 I prefer to create conditions and arguments 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:23.870
 that generate is the name perception of value and 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.300
 gum in the customer's mind by causing 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.240
 they ask more to buy more by going 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.389
 asking for buying tips other than 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.949
 I planned to buy when this happens 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:35.689
 supplier is no longer a 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:38.899
 company and should become a 

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:40.159
 product consultancy and 

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:42.889
 customer company 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:46.449
 the supplier to help the customer grow 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.919
 more to buy more and more 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:50.419
 Take advantage of these mistakes I made 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.550
 You know more about my job. 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:55.520

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:04.699

 A big hug to help you. 

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:09.610

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:09.610
 This leaves God with a big hug.
