 in Greek mythology is cleo 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 one of the nine muses she and her 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.190
 sisters are the gymnasts of zeus and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.660
 Cleo touching is the muse of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.080
 historiography at the clio 4 is that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 called new online multimedia system 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 everything works in the same way as well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.510
 a tablet computer and you can do it with 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
 compare to the ipad 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 currently there is the clio 4 with four 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 Motorizations are available two 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.770
 petrol and two diesel each 75th 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.780
 and 90 ps 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.370
 completely new is the 90 hp petrol engine 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.590
 energy dci 90 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.390
 this is a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.199
 three-cylinder engine with turbocharging 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.590
 and gasoline direct injection the new 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.530
 engine with 0.9 liter capacity is sufficient 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.439
 loud with only 4 5 liters per 100 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 kilometer and a start-stop system 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.170
 in the 90 ps gasoline with it in the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.490
 basic version already exists with one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.869
 extensive equipment 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.080
 there is, for example, one 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.220
 Air conditioning of a relations device 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.659
 electric windows front 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.659
 but what is not there 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:38.509
 So in the price list if you the 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.740
 small discs behind import 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.210
 Want 's here as usual at 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.200
 renault the child insurance the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.509
 Works flawlessly 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.509
 I have a big suitcase space 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.280
 ascended is that roof edge 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.649
 is low and I have twice now 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 when getting in the head arrives and that 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.720
 is really blatant 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.819
 but maybe that's because of me 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.799
 so big and the french are rather small 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.630
 welcome to the new renault clio the 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.640
 fourth generation or even phase 4 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.590
 called and we drive here now 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.590
 renault clio tci 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.410
 90 gc stands again new engine bauer has 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.010
 that's a 0.9 liter engine with 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.470
 turbocharging 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.269
 he does 90 ps at 135 newton meters like 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.980
 At Renault usual in the newer model 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.690
 you can give him one with one 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.250
 start stop button activate 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 or start 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.110
 this new renault clio has in the eco 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.770
 version or in a diversion has 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.420
 he here the possibility stop the start 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.710
 to enable automatic that is when 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.270
 The vehicle is at the intersection 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.500
 the engine shuts off when it does 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.090
 get back on the gas switch 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.920
 the motor back on the fuel-saving 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.460
 because he has an eco here 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.900
 button press this eco button saves 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.000
 another ten percent to the clio 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 a fuel by simply the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.330
 engine performance slightly degrades or 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.790
 had and if the air conditioning 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.140
 turned is then runs the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.510
 Air conditioning in eco mode 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.709
 that helps explain a very direct and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.540
 sensitive steering 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.230
 The chassis is very hard 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.030
 tuned there you really play each 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.470
 blowhole and on the bad 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.820
 bad roads 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.820
 the fat off 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.200
 So 4,000 tours is the car completely 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.520
 orderly 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.520
 loud pointed to drive 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.470
 or even fun 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 and that is incredible is the first one 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.390
 times with the subway you 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.060
 So you can be quite good 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:58.170
 a few years renault is very 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.240
 innovative and dare to simply 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.380
 Things that other manufacturers do 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.010
 not room 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:10.430
 for example, they say that once 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.810
 first affordable urban electro 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.660
 Electromobile it is a quad or something 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.370
 back on the car called the twizy 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.220
 you can get to the market 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.380
 to buy about 8000 euro and I think so 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.590
 very well although these enthusiastic 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.260
 from crisis and another innovation is 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.850
 this system is nothing more than 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.870
 a tablet pc built into the car 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.270
 is and with the engine electronics 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.950
 you can connect this one over 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.270
 pair bluetooth with the phone and picked up 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:45.870
 call or even navigate the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.730
 It's like a navigation system, too 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.040
 you can see very well and that 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.200
 special about this system is that it 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.450
 running on the android operating system 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.160
 that is a future future that is 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.480
 not yet possible yet still working 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.730
 You can still remember it then 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.250
 downloaded apps from the 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.750
 renault app store and have these apps 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.900
 then different functions the same 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.510
 like the mobile phone like my cellphone now 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.650
 hanni this is a samsung galaxy note 2 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.310
 I do not want to do that 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.130
 I have a very good hands then sees 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.600
 here it is also from the bigger one 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.250
 get there, it is virtually a Tablet PC 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.590
 all the car inside is built in for 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.810
 I'm quite smart we have it in too 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.940
 future all vehicle manufacturers 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.090
 cars start off with such tablets because 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.910
 that just gets calling to be standard 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.260
 becomes 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.470
 the only thing I do not like so much 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.520
 is like this tablet pc in the car 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.410
 was integrated 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.550
 It's like that if you have a TV speaker 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.320
 listen and he promises himself or one 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.970
 dancer does not in baghdad a 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.070
 actor of his text 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.440
 then forget one of these small 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.540
 error immediately and that's exactly how it is 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.510
 here with this 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.100
 however system is just like that 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.300
 some dashboard is built into it 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.420
 just have to get used to it 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.610
 out of town and the second thing I something 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.280
 uncomfortable feeling is this steering wheel 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.540
 it is this hard plastic is application 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.190
 very nice to look at 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.930
 however, if you take action it is 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.560
 very clear and you will not find one here 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.490
 good stop 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.550
 and it sounds weird but the fingers 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.890
 stay tuned yes it is real 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.110
 it does not feel good otherwise 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.140
 Can you say to the interior that 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.850
 high quality is not here now 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.940
 no vw standard is processed now 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:39.250
 or no auto standard but I would 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.630
 say for the price range and for 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.980
 It is a small car or a class car 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.130
 that's okay there are 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.590
 just very cheap it does not work that way 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.690
 is processed to the highest quality 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.800
 first glance but it is something 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.100
 cheap when it more closely 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.100
 looks 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.860
 The chassis has been tightly tuned 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.410
 a very direct steering and therefore can 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.550
 you 're pretty nice chunks so 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:10.390
 you notice excellent road situation and 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.390
 if I continue 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:30.400
 this is a three-cylinder engine and 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:34.240
 this three-cylinder engine manages 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.420
 0.9 liters displacement 90 hp with the help of one 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.120
 turbocharger and I should be elaborate 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.700
 designed motors have high 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.100
 The following should break something or something 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.610
 be defect 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.500
 and they are also maintenance intensive and 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.480
 have where expectation costs 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.850
 I hope that is clear to you if you 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:00.490
 opt for such a car, however 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:02.710
 in the future it will now ccc the or 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.170
 as here at renault tc engines give 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:08.200
 the normal says motorcycle gasoline with 

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:12.060
 a high displacement is actually already 

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.060
 an endangered breed
