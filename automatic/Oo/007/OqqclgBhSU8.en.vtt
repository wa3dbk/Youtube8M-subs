moisture
the<00:03:36.830> next<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.459> final<00:03:37.730> step<00:03:38.300> is<00:03:38.540> sealing<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.620> use

coconut<00:03:40.790> oil<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:41.599> seal<00:03:41.900> all<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.440> moisture<00:03:42.980> in
