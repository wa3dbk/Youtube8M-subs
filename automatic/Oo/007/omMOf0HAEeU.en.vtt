00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.209
 I don't bother playing anymore, this puzzle is boring 

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:51.245
 Have been trying too long, but it just turns out to be me 

00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:54.231
 Hard work, nothing wrong, I gave it all my time 

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.191
 And at the end, I was really telling you to hurt me 

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.556
 I waited a long time and planned my return 

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.040
 Had killed for the solution in the day but I got no directions 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.389
 The grain filled my meter, I got up and I kicked 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.202
 Jigsaw puzzle out and smiled as I slipped 

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.281
 On the bits, which may not fade away 

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:15.030
 But until then I will not tear up any more wounds 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.209
 So damaging them, because the wounds are just internal 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.254
 Losing power, it is so certain that someone abuses 

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:24.196
 Take advantage of the situation and let the world collapse 

00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:27.263
 Stand strong, don't take any of this into you 

00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:29.946
 Therefore, puzzle is just a puzzle, bits sometimes do not fit 

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:33.187
 Anyway, while most are bent and damaged 

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:36.172
 I don't mind spending more time waiting 

00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:39.354
 Love is eternal, but I take more than ever to crawl 

00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:42.130
 If there is no decision, it is right for good 

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:45.360
 Let me rest, let me feel (well) 

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:48.180
 I don't mind spending more time waiting 

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:51.380
 Love is eternal, but I take more than ever to crawl 

00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:54.080
 If there is no decision, it is right for good 

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:57.210
 Let me rest, let me feel (well) 

00:01:57.207 --> 00:02:00.270
 So when everything is right and I see the publisher 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.240
 Then I look at it, look at this puzzle 

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:06.180
 I don't want to call it a lie, but I still lie to myself 

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:09.310
 That maybe now, this time, I manage to puzzle right 

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:12.380
 That maybe those bits have been improving since last time 

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:15.580
 And got in the right order and helped me climb 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.670
 This mountain, my own Everest, but no matter who I take 

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:21.240
 Then every bit will be as fucked as I come 

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:24.110
 I limb and I limb, but it doesn't fit together 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 I didn't go, I thought I needed you to breathe 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 I didn't go, I thought I needed you to breathe 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.160
 But a bit of this head full of solutions 

00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:33.100
 Did not want to open and release any free 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.200
 And it is malicious thinking, though I thank her for it 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.380
 If it wasn't for her, I'd never go 

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:42.380
 I was back in the habit of habit 

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:45.560
 Trying to create a picture that no longer makes me happy 

00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.630
 I don't mind spending more time waiting 

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.930
 Love is eternal, but I take more than ever to crawl 

00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:55.580
 If there is no decision, it is right for good 

00:02:55.582 --> 00:02:58.900
 Let me rest, let me feel (well) 

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:01.620
 I don't mind spending more time waiting 

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:04.860
 Love is eternal, but I take more than ever to crawl 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.580
 If there is no decision, it is right for good 

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:10.850
 Let me rest, let me feel (well) 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.560
 I don't mind spending more time waiting 

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:16.470
 Love is eternal but I take more than ever to crawl 

00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.660
 If there is no decision, it is right for good 

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:22.660
 Let me rest, let me feel (well) 

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.520
 I don't mind spending more time waiting 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.830
 Love is eternal, but I take more than ever to crawl 

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:31.480
 If there is no decision, it is right for good 

00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:35.970
 Let me rest, let me feel good 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:52.660
 Puzzle, the game that plays for me 

00:03:52.657 --> 00:04:00.520
 Puzzle, I tried everything but you don't fit together 

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:04.750
 The game that plays for me 

00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:12.680
 Puzzle, I tried everything but you will never fit
