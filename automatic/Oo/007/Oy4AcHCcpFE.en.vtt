00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
a gloss black color looks pretty sharp

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.960 
a gloss black color looks pretty sharp
although<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.409> say<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.040> black<00:01:11.610> color

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
although I will say that the black color

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.050 
although I will say that the black color
does<00:01:12.270> tend<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> show<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> dust<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:14.060> you're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
does tend to show the dust so if you're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.640

in a dusty environment you may want to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.770

dust<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.250> every<00:01:17.580> few<00:01:17.850> days<00:01:18.030> before<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

then push a button on this unit and then
within<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.050> few<00:02:23.260> minutes<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.800> synched<00:02:24.550> up<00:02:24.640> with

within a few minutes it synched up with

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.790 
within a few minutes it synched up with
my<00:02:25.060> router<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.780> was<00:02:25.900> pretty<00:02:26.140> easy<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.560> do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
my router so it was pretty easy to do

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.780 
my router so it was pretty easy to do
that<00:02:26.830> way<00:02:28.349> I'm<00:02:29.349> really<00:02:29.650> happy<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.310> unit

pretty quickly also I haven't used the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.830 
pretty quickly also I haven't used the
copying<00:02:45.519> feature<00:02:45.910> yet<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:46.450> I'm<00:02:46.569> sure<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
copying feature yet but I'm sure that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.449 
copying feature yet but I'm sure that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
relatively quickly my overall impression

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.729 
relatively quickly my overall impression
of<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.220> unit<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.109> money<00:03:20.350> it's<00:03:20.590> a

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
of this unit is for the money it's a

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.080 
of this unit is for the money it's a
really<00:03:21.130> nice<00:03:21.340> unit<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:23.739> has<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.310> two<00:03:24.519> ink

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
really nice unit it has the two ink

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.849 
really nice unit it has the two ink
cartridges<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:25.780> has<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> black<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.680> has<00:03:26.709> a

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
cartridges it has a black and it has a

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.460 
cartridges it has a black and it has a
tricolor<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:28.239> yeah<00:03:28.810> they're<00:03:29.079> fairly

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
tricolor and yeah they're fairly

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.479 
tricolor and yeah they're fairly
expensive<00:03:30.100> but<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.910> know<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.090> can<00:03:31.359> get

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
expensive but you know you can get

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.680 
expensive but you know you can get
remanufactured<00:03:33.489> or<00:03:33.609> refilled<00:03:34.060> cartridges

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
remanufactured or refilled cartridges

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.229 
remanufactured or refilled cartridges
you<00:03:34.810> can<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:35.049> those<00:03:35.200> cheaper<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:37.120> know

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
you can get those cheaper so you know

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.060 
you can get those cheaper so you know
you<00:03:37.299> probably<00:03:37.630> could<00:03:37.780> save<00:03:38.049> on<00:03:38.260> ink<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.709> way

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
you probably could save on ink that way

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.270 
you probably could save on ink that way
I<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:40.870> it's<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.170> really<00:03:41.440> nice<00:03:41.620> unit<00:03:42.070> for

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
I think it's a really nice unit for

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.349 
I think it's a really nice unit for
general<00:03:42.700> printing<00:03:44.640> kind<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.790> occasional

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
general printing kind of occasional

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.560 
general printing kind of occasional
photo<00:03:46.660> printing<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.530> sort<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:47.920> thing

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
photo printing and that sort of thing

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.680 
photo printing and that sort of thing
copying<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:50.799> has<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.130> Wi-Fi<00:03:51.670> feature<00:03:52.030> one

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.539 
copying it has the Wi-Fi feature one
additional<00:03:53.170> feature<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.680> has<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:54.190> it's<00:03:54.340> kind
