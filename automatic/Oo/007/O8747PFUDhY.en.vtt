now you might think that it's a little
late<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.780> unboxing<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.530> GTX<00:00:11.099> 570<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:12.599> this

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
late to be unboxing a GTX 570 but this

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.300 
late to be unboxing a GTX 570 but this
one<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.710> bit<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.460> twist<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:16.100> you<00:00:17.100> guys

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
might find interesting who knows so this

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.259 
might find interesting who knows so this
is<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> galaxy<00:00:20.670> MDT<00:00:21.320> gtx<00:00:22.320> 570<00:00:23.010> scott<00:00:23.310> 1280

is the galaxy MDT gtx 570 scott 1280

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.349 
is the galaxy MDT gtx 570 scott 1280
Meg's<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.779> RAM<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.500> most<00:00:25.890> gtx<00:00:26.430> 570s

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
Meg's of RAM just like most gtx 570s

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.169 
Meg's of RAM just like most gtx 570s
it's<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.170> test<00:00:28.859> form<00:00:29.160> inside<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> not

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it's got a test form inside which is not

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.959 
it's got a test form inside which is not
actually<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> guys<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.529> rather<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:32.099> my

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
actually for you guys but rather for my

actually for you guys but rather for my
use<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:35.010> foam<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.550> has<00:00:36.239> wind<00:00:36.719> split

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
use it has some foam and has wind split

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.290 
use it has some foam and has wind split
settings<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> interesting<00:00:38.969> but

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
settings so this is interesting but

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.610 
settings so this is interesting but
we'll<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> little

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
we'll get into more about that a little

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.180 
we'll get into more about that a little

bit later

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
bit later
it<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.750> MDT<00:00:43.230> series<00:00:43.739> exclusive

software settings guide which is also

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.229 
software settings guide which is also
interesting<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.610> we'll<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.789> into<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
interesting but we'll get into that a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.610 
interesting but we'll get into that a
little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.660> later<00:00:48.780> graphics<00:00:49.379> card

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
way so we've got dual molex to PCIe

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
way so we've got dual molex to PCIe
eight<00:01:17.280> pin<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.390> we've<00:01:18.509> got<00:01:18.689> dual<00:01:18.960> molex

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

graphics<00:01:32.759> card<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.450> probably<00:01:34.409> time<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
graphics card it's probably time to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
graphics card it's probably time to
think<00:01:35.159> about<00:01:35.280> upgrading<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.850> very

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
think about upgrading and is very

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.870 
think about upgrading and is very
interesting<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.100> particular<00:01:47.340> video

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
interesting about this particular video

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.499 
interesting about this particular video
card<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.079> 570<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.799> still<00:01:50.070> by<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.700> rights<00:01:51.149> a

high performance graphics card but it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
high performance graphics card but it's
always<00:01:54.750> had<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.439> disadvantage<00:01:56.250> in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
monitor which is very very cool I mean I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.580 
monitor which is very very cool I mean I
suppose<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.570> could<00:02:36.750> run<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.020> four<00:02:37.230> displays

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
suppose you could run the four displays

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.720 
suppose you could run the four displays
at<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> time<00:02:38.070> but<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> wouldn't<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.700> very

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
at a time but that wouldn't be very

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.250 
at a time but that wouldn't be very
beneficial<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.450> you'd<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.780> bezel

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
beneficial because you'd have a bezel

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.840 
beneficial because you'd have a bezel
like<00:02:40.380> right<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.770> middle<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.820> a

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
like right in the middle so this is a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.550 
like right in the middle so this is a
gaming<00:02:42.300> card<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.660> intended<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.230> gaming<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
gaming card it's intended for gaming so

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.190 
gaming card it's intended for gaming so
I'm<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.070> ahead<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.900> say<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
I'm going to go ahead and say that I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.950 
I'm going to go ahead and say that I
think<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.620> intended<00:02:47.100> use<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.460> probably<00:02:48.150> four

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
think the intended use is probably four

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.550 
think the intended use is probably four
three<00:02:49.440> displays<00:02:49.860> at<00:02:50.130> 1080p<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:52.020> surround

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
three displays at 1080p in a surround

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.680 
three displays at 1080p in a surround
gaming<00:02:53.250> mode<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.790> how<00:02:53.970> they<00:02:54.210> achieve<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
gaming mode so how they achieve this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.380 
gaming mode so how they achieve this
well<00:02:54.990> one<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:55.770> have<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.370> custom<00:02:57.000> designed

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
well one they have a custom designed

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.990 
well one they have a custom designed
card<00:02:57.990> so<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.680> see<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> completely

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
card so you can see this is a completely

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.150 
card so you can see this is a completely
non<00:03:00.240> reference<00:03:00.720> card<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.500> four<00:03:01.800> DVI

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
non reference card with four DVI

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.520 
non reference card with four DVI
connectors<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.210> as<00:03:03.360> well<00:03:03.990> as<00:03:04.290> an

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
connectors on it as well as an

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.730 
connectors on it as well as an
aftermarket<00:03:04.980> cooler<00:03:05.570> so<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:07.110> there<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> go

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
aftermarket cooler so here there you go

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.110 
aftermarket cooler so here there you go
you<00:03:07.950> guys<00:03:08.070> can<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.490> look<00:03:08.610> at<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> cooler

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
you guys can have a look at the cooler

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.730 
you guys can have a look at the cooler
so<00:03:09.300> it's<00:03:09.390> got<00:03:09.510> an<00:03:09.630> eighty<00:03:09.780> millimeter<00:03:10.230> fan<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
so it's got an eighty millimeter fan and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.400 
so it's got an eighty millimeter fan and
a<00:03:10.800> very<00:03:11.220> beefy<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.030> very<00:03:12.510> heavy<00:03:12.810> heatsink

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
a very beefy and very heavy heatsink

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.200 
a very beefy and very heavy heatsink
going<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.800> here<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.550> check<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.880> out<00:03:15.030> we've

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
going on here so check this out we've

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.740 
going on here so check this out we've
got<00:03:15.450> one<00:03:16.290> two<00:03:16.620> heat<00:03:17.400> pipes<00:03:17.670> three<00:03:18.270> heat<00:03:18.510> pipes

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
got one two heat pipes three heat pipes

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.870 
got one two heat pipes three heat pipes
it's<00:03:19.350> hard<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.650> kind<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.920> see<00:03:20.130> those<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.550> there

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
it's hard to kind of see those in there

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.270 
it's hard to kind of see those in there
how<00:03:21.630> many<00:03:21.840> heat<00:03:21.959> pipes<00:03:22.170> do<00:03:22.290> we<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.530> total<00:03:22.709> can

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
how many heat pipes do we have total can

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.670 
how many heat pipes do we have total can
you<00:03:23.340> see<00:03:23.550> in<00:03:23.820> there<00:03:24.060> four<00:03:24.870> heat<00:03:25.020> pipes<00:03:25.230> total<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
you see in there four heat pipes total I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.230 
you see in there four heat pipes total I
think<00:03:25.860> it's<00:03:26.130> four<00:03:26.340> heat<00:03:26.490> pipes<00:03:26.670> total<00:03:27.030> yeah

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
think it's four heat pipes total yeah

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.560 
think it's four heat pipes total yeah
yeah<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.140> four<00:03:28.380> heat<00:03:28.530> pipes<00:03:28.740> total<00:03:29.100> including

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
yeah so four heat pipes total including

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.540 
yeah so four heat pipes total including
so<00:03:30.570> two<00:03:30.630> coming<00:03:31.080> out<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.440> left<00:03:31.590> here<00:03:31.950> or<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
so two coming out to the left here or to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.190 
so two coming out to the left here or to
the<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.390> two<00:03:33.540> coming<00:03:33.840> out<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the right and then two coming out to the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.760 
the right and then two coming out to the
left<00:03:34.380> very<00:03:35.100> dense<00:03:35.459> aluminum<00:03:36.390> fin<00:03:36.750> array<00:03:37.380> on

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
left very dense aluminum fin array on

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.580 
left very dense aluminum fin array on
both<00:03:38.220> sides<00:03:38.580> as<00:03:38.970> well<00:03:39.540> as<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.780> downward<00:03:40.320> draft

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
both sides as well as a downward draft

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.110 
both sides as well as a downward draft
fan<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.160> actually<00:03:41.550> very<00:03:41.730> cleverly

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
fan that is actually very cleverly

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.600 
fan that is actually very cleverly
positioned<00:03:42.420> because<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:43.739> almost<00:03:44.250> directly

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
positioned because it's almost directly

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.360 
positioned because it's almost directly
over<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> PWM<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.290> while<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.860> use<00:03:47.100> these

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
over the PWM so while we can use these

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.100 
over the PWM so while we can use these
heat<00:03:47.700> pipes<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.450> are<00:03:48.510> positioned<00:03:49.020> directly

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
heat pipes that are positioned directly

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.500 
heat pipes that are positioned directly
above<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> GPU<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.160> distribute<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.000> heat<00:03:51.300> to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
above the GPU to distribute that heat to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.510 
above the GPU to distribute that heat to
the<00:03:51.600> rest<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.050> fins<00:03:52.260> we<00:03:52.800> use<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.220> fans

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
the rest of the fins we use the fans

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.030 
the rest of the fins we use the fans
direct<00:03:54.150> cooling<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.810> order<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.260> keep<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
direct cooling in order to keep the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.170 
direct cooling in order to keep the
voltage<00:03:56.790> regulators<00:03:57.450> cool<00:03:58.200> enough<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.180> that's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
voltage regulators cool enough so that's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.699 
voltage regulators cool enough so that's
pretty<00:04:00.450> much<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.840> for<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.140> part<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> card

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
pretty much it for that part of the card

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.370 
pretty much it for that part of the card
so<00:04:01.890> let's<00:04:01.920> get<00:04:02.280> back<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.630> display<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.200> you

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
so let's get back to the display so you

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.840 
so let's get back to the display so you
have<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> couple<00:04:04.920> different<00:04:05.340> options<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.730> can

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
have a couple different options you can

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.910 
have a couple different options you can
run<00:04:06.180> them<00:04:06.330> normally<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.320> can<00:04:07.500> see<00:04:07.680> there's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
run them normally so you can see there's

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.840 
run them normally so you can see there's
dvi-i<00:04:08.430> DVID<00:04:09.300> one<00:04:09.690> DVID<00:04:10.200> two<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.739> DVID<00:04:11.160> three

this<00:04:32.039> particular<00:04:32.250> graphics<00:04:32.970> card<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.240> in

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
this particular graphics card so in

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
monitor gaming thing because really

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.429 
monitor gaming thing because really
that's<00:04:38.370> how<00:04:38.699> many<00:04:39.030> monitors<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.629> can<00:04:39.659> span<00:04:40.139> a

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
that's how many monitors you can span a

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.010 
that's how many monitors you can span a
single<00:04:41.219> virtual<00:04:41.819> display<00:04:42.270> much<00:04:42.509> like<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> way

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
single virtual display much like the way

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
numbered ones so we've got DVID one two

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.980 
numbered ones so we've got DVID one two
and<00:04:47.099> three<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.610> these<00:04:48.000> guys<00:04:48.240> are<00:04:48.270> only<00:04:48.629> good

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
and three and these guys are only good

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.219 
and three and these guys are only good
up<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.620> 1920<00:04:50.219> by<00:04:50.550> 1080<00:04:51.210> if<00:04:51.599> you're<00:04:52.050> running

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
1080p monitors are the most you're going

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.740 
1080p monitors are the most you're going
to<00:04:56.520> be<00:04:56.610> able<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.789> do<00:04:56.909> triple<00:04:57.150> displays<00:04:57.539> on

to be able to do triple displays on

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.869 
to be able to do triple displays on
however<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.500> should<00:04:58.680> be<00:04:58.800> noted<00:04:59.189> that<00:04:59.340> with<00:04:59.849> a

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
however it should be noted that with a

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.270 
however it should be noted that with a
GTX<00:05:00.389> 570<00:05:00.990> level<00:05:01.229> graphics<00:05:01.650> card<00:05:01.860> unless

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
GTX 570 level graphics card unless

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.550 
GTX 570 level graphics card unless
you're<00:05:02.490> running<00:05:02.639> more<00:05:03.000> than<00:05:03.060> one<00:05:03.240> card<00:05:03.750> you're

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
you're running more than one card you're

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.980 
you're running more than one card you're
probably<00:05:05.099> only<00:05:05.430> going<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.789> want<00:05:06.030> three<00:05:06.389> 1080p

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
probably only going to want three 1080p

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.570 
probably only going to want three 1080p
monitors<00:05:07.409> anyway<00:05:07.860> you're<00:05:08.009> not<00:05:08.039> going<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.400> run

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
monitors anyway you're not going to run

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.149 
monitors anyway you're not going to run
330<00:05:09.240> inches<00:05:09.569> off<00:05:09.719> something<00:05:10.050> like<00:05:10.199> this<00:05:10.409> okay

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
330 inches off something like this okay

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.080 
330 inches off something like this okay
so<00:05:11.219> you<00:05:11.580> either<00:05:11.759> run<00:05:12.500> two<00:05:13.500> displays<00:05:13.949> plus<00:05:14.789> one

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
so you either run two displays plus one

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.330 
so you either run two displays plus one
which<00:05:15.419> runs<00:05:15.659> off<00:05:15.840> either<00:05:16.020> these<00:05:16.469> or<00:05:16.680> you<00:05:16.770> run

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
which runs off either these or you run

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.430 
which runs off either these or you run
three<00:05:17.639> displays<00:05:18.060> plus<00:05:18.539> one<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.050> runs<00:05:19.169> off

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
three displays plus one that runs off

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.740 
three displays plus one that runs off
either<00:05:19.680> these<00:05:20.159> so<00:05:20.669> this<00:05:20.789> is<00:05:20.969> great<00:05:21.180> for<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.479> used

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
either these so this is great for I used

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.240 
either these so this is great for I used
to<00:05:21.870> play<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.050> fair<00:05:22.259> man<00:05:22.379> the<00:05:22.440> supreme<00:05:22.770> commander

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
to play a fair man the supreme commander

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.790 
to play a fair man the supreme commander
so<00:05:23.639> if<00:05:23.759> I<00:05:23.879> wanted<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.240> run<00:05:24.479> triple<00:05:25.199> monitor<00:05:25.379> and

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
so if I wanted to run triple monitor and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.429 
so if I wanted to run triple monitor and
then<00:05:25.979> have<00:05:26.219> my<00:05:26.550> mini-map<00:05:27.270> displayed<00:05:27.750> on<00:05:28.020> an

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
then have my mini-map displayed on an

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.890 
then have my mini-map displayed on an
additional<00:05:29.310> one<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:30.029> is<00:05:30.240> how<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.449> would<00:05:30.659> do<00:05:30.779> it

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
additional one that is how I would do it

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.450 
additional one that is how I would do it
because<00:05:31.020> Supreme<00:05:31.500> Commander<00:05:31.919> was<00:05:32.039> multi

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
because Supreme Commander was multi

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.399 
because Supreme Commander was multi
display<00:05:32.819> capable<00:05:33.300> whereas<00:05:34.050> if<00:05:34.199> you<00:05:34.289> have<00:05:34.379> a

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
display capable whereas if you have a

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.709 
display capable whereas if you have a
game<00:05:34.650> like<00:05:34.860> race<00:05:35.159> driver<00:05:35.460> grid<00:05:35.909> you<00:05:36.569> would

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
game like race driver grid you would

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.659 
game like race driver grid you would
only<00:05:36.870> be<00:05:36.990> able<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.440> run<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.770> off<00:05:37.919> one<00:05:38.279> monitor

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
only be able to run it off one monitor

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:39.589 
only be able to run it off one monitor
and<00:05:38.759> then<00:05:38.849> you<00:05:38.940> might<00:05:39.060> be<00:05:39.180> able<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.330> have<00:05:39.479> like

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
and then you might be able to have like

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.330 
and then you might be able to have like
task<00:05:39.900> manager<00:05:40.379> or<00:05:40.409> whatever<00:05:40.770> displayed<00:05:41.219> it

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
task manager or whatever displayed it

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.920 
task manager or whatever displayed it
depends<00:05:41.759> on<00:05:41.819> whether<00:05:41.969> the<00:05:42.180> game<00:05:42.330> is<00:05:42.389> multi

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
depends on whether the game is multi

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.110 
depends on whether the game is multi
display<00:05:43.080> compatible<00:05:43.800> or<00:05:43.949> not<00:05:43.979> so<00:05:44.729> these<00:05:44.879> guys

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
display compatible or not so these guys

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.510 
display compatible or not so these guys
create<00:05:45.539> one<00:05:45.719> virtual<00:05:46.199> display<00:05:46.589> these<00:05:47.190> guys

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
create one virtual display these guys

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.760 
create one virtual display these guys
are<00:05:47.849> a<00:05:47.909> secondary<00:05:48.750> monitor<00:05:49.229> so<00:05:49.469> I<00:05:49.500> hope<00:05:49.740> that

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
are a secondary monitor so I hope that

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.860 
are a secondary monitor so I hope that
that's<00:05:50.099> clear<00:05:50.460> now<00:05:50.610> galaxy<00:05:51.360> does<00:05:51.509> provide<00:05:51.810> a

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
that's clear now galaxy does provide a

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.689 
that's clear now galaxy does provide a
couple<00:05:52.259> pieces<00:05:52.589> of<00:05:52.740> software<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.370> both<00:05:53.550> the

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
couple pieces of software the both the

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.269 
couple pieces of software the both the
win<00:05:53.849> split<00:05:54.180> as<00:05:54.330> well<00:05:54.569> as<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.810> easy<00:05:55.020> easy<00:05:55.860> why

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
win split as well as the easy easy why

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.909 
win split as well as the easy easy why
easy<00:05:57.029> wide<00:05:57.300> display<00:05:57.599> software<00:05:58.169> settings<00:05:58.740> so

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
easy wide display software settings so

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.379 
easy wide display software settings so
you<00:05:58.949> can<00:05:59.219> use<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.520> in<00:05:59.669> order<00:05:59.819> to<00:06:00.029> configure

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
you can use that in order to configure

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.450 
you can use that in order to configure
everything<00:06:00.719> properly<00:06:01.319> because<00:06:01.469> it's<00:06:02.219> not

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
everything properly because it's not

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.459 
everything properly because it's not
built<00:06:02.669> into<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.029> GeForce<00:06:03.479> driver<00:06:03.810> this<00:06:04.259> is<00:06:04.440> a

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
built into the GeForce driver this is a

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.529 
built into the GeForce driver this is a
galaxy<00:06:04.860> exclusive<00:06:05.550> technology<00:06:06.120> which<00:06:06.270> is<00:06:06.389> one

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
galaxy exclusive technology which is one

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.640 
galaxy exclusive technology which is one
of<00:06:06.629> the<00:06:06.690> reasons<00:06:07.050> I<00:06:07.139> don't<00:06:07.289> know<00:06:07.349> if<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.529> guys

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
of the reasons I don't know if you guys

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.140 
of the reasons I don't know if you guys
have<00:06:07.830> noticed<00:06:07.949> but<00:06:08.190> this<00:06:08.339> is<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.639> first<00:06:08.879> time

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
have noticed but this is the first time

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.149 
have noticed but this is the first time
I've<00:06:09.330> ever<00:06:09.479> looked<00:06:09.659> at<00:06:09.810> a<00:06:09.870> galaxy<00:06:10.199> card<00:06:10.589> but

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
I've ever looked at a galaxy card but

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.189 
I've ever looked at a galaxy card but
this<00:06:11.279> is<00:06:11.400> one<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.699> reasons<00:06:12.120> why<00:06:12.690> I<00:06:12.719> think

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
this is one of the reasons why I think

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.170 
this is one of the reasons why I think
this<00:06:13.500> one<00:06:13.710> is<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:13.860> neat<00:06:14.190> because<00:06:14.219> unlike<00:06:14.940> any

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
this one is so neat because unlike any

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.180 
this one is so neat because unlike any
other<00:06:15.419> GeForce<00:06:15.930> card<00:06:16.199> other<00:06:16.440> than<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.740> GTX

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
other GeForce card other than the GTX

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.219 
other GeForce card other than the GTX
590<00:06:17.460> which<00:06:18.089> is<00:06:18.270> kind<00:06:18.539> of<00:06:18.569> cheating<00:06:18.779> because<00:06:19.020> it

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
590 which is kind of cheating because it

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.230 
590 which is kind of cheating because it
has<00:06:19.349> two<00:06:19.620> GPUs<00:06:19.979> on<00:06:20.279> it<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.789> achieve<00:06:21.089> its

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
has two GPUs on it to achieve its

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.369 
has two GPUs on it to achieve its
surround<00:06:21.629> gaming<00:06:22.529> glory<00:06:23.690> this<00:06:24.690> one<00:06:24.960> supports

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
surround gaming glory this one supports

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.869 
surround gaming glory this one supports
surrounds<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.009> is<00:06:26.129> a<00:06:26.159> direct<00:06:26.339> competitor

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
surrounds so it is a direct competitor

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.269 
surrounds so it is a direct competitor
and<00:06:27.270> it<00:06:27.629> is<00:06:27.719> completely<00:06:28.259> feature<00:06:28.650> competitive

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 
and it is completely feature competitive

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.860 
and it is completely feature competitive
against<00:06:29.610> any<00:06:29.729> AMD<00:06:30.150> card<00:06:30.389> because<00:06:30.690> not<00:06:30.839> only

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
against any AMD card because not only

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.019 
against any AMD card because not only
does<00:06:31.169> it<00:06:31.229> have<00:06:31.440> 3d<00:06:31.800> vision<00:06:32.129> and<00:06:32.279> all<00:06:32.699> that<00:06:32.879> good

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
does it have 3d vision and all that good

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.010 
does it have 3d vision and all that good
stuff<00:06:33.089> it<00:06:33.719> also<00:06:34.110> has<00:06:34.909> high<00:06:35.909> affinity<00:06:36.389> which<00:06:36.870> I

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
stuff it also has high affinity which I

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.240 
stuff it also has high affinity which I
don't<00:06:37.080> know<00:06:37.319> what<00:06:37.440> to<00:06:37.560> call<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:37.860> I<00:06:37.949> mean<00:06:38.069> we'll

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
don't know what to call it I mean we'll

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.330 
don't know what to call it I mean we'll
call<00:06:38.370> it<00:06:38.490> invidious<00:06:38.880> around

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
call it invidious around

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.439 
call it invidious around
yes<00:06:39.550> because<00:06:39.699> that's<00:06:39.910> what<00:06:40.030> it's<00:06:40.150> called<00:06:40.270> then

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
yes because that's what it's called then

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.930 
yes because that's what it's called then
you<00:06:40.510> have<00:06:40.600> two<00:06:40.750> cards<00:06:41.020> but<00:06:41.740> it's<00:06:42.040> got<00:06:42.250> it<00:06:42.400> on<00:06:42.550> a

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
you have two cards but it's got it on a

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.480 
you have two cards but it's got it on a
single<00:06:43.449> card<00:06:43.870> so<00:06:44.169> since<00:06:44.740> I've<00:06:44.889> never<00:06:45.220> talked

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
single card so since I've never talked

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.800 
single card so since I've never talked
about<00:06:45.669> galaxy<00:06:46.150> before<00:06:46.300> I<00:06:46.510> should<00:06:46.720> probably

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
about galaxy before I should probably

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.270 
about galaxy before I should probably
mention<00:06:47.050> a<00:06:47.290> couple<00:06:47.410> other<00:06:47.620> things<00:06:47.770> so<00:06:48.130> they've

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
mention a couple other things so they've

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.969 
mention a couple other things so they've
got<00:06:48.400> 24/7<00:06:49.150> 365<00:06:49.330> tech<00:06:49.990> support<00:06:50.350> for<00:06:50.530> US<00:06:50.770> and

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
got 24/7 365 tech support for US and

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:52.320 
got 24/7 365 tech support for US and
Canada<00:06:51.310> only<00:06:51.460> I<00:06:51.639> don't<00:06:51.760> know<00:06:51.970> about<00:06:52.090> other

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
Canada only I don't know about other

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
territories guys extreme tuner HD so

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.460 
territories guys extreme tuner HD so
they've<00:06:55.030> got<00:06:55.240> some<00:06:55.419> overclocking<00:06:55.630> software

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
they've got some overclocking software

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.830 
they've got some overclocking software
they<00:06:56.889> also<00:06:57.040> have<00:06:57.280> a<00:06:57.310> one-click<00:06:57.760> ezy<00:06:58.479> buttons

got a dual BIOS we're used to seeing

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.460 
got a dual BIOS we're used to seeing
these<00:07:06.520> on<00:07:06.790> motherboards<00:07:07.090> now<00:07:07.510> but<00:07:07.840> it's<00:07:08.139> not

these on motherboards now but it's not

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.140 
these on motherboards now but it's not
that<00:07:08.650> often<00:07:08.889> we<00:07:09.160> see<00:07:09.310> it<00:07:09.370> on<00:07:09.460> graphics<00:07:09.880> cards

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150

are<00:07:27.100> gonna<00:07:27.280> need<00:07:27.520> a<00:07:27.580> card<00:07:27.880> like<00:07:27.940> this<00:07:28.210> because

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630 
are gonna need a card like this because
