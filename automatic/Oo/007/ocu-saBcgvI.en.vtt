00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.080 
top like so and then pull through two
and<00:01:36.929> two<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.639> whole<00:01:38.670> point<00:01:38.969> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and two so you see the whole point of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.309 
and two so you see the whole point of
this<00:01:39.209> is<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.569> you're<00:01:39.689> ending<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.139> with<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
this is that you're ending up with a

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.989 
this is that you're ending up with a
beautiful<00:01:40.829> stitch<00:01:41.039> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.520> bottom<00:01:41.639> as<00:01:41.939> well

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
beautiful stitch on the bottom as well

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.239 
beautiful stitch on the bottom as well
as<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.749> top<00:01:42.779> so<00:01:43.469> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.679> turn<00:01:44.009> this

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:52.529 
have to be honest with you I think that

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.139 
have to be honest with you I think that
most<00:01:52.799> projects<00:01:53.279> should<00:01:53.490> start<00:01:53.789> off<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
most projects should start off with the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.029 
most projects should start off with the
foundation<00:01:54.270> chain<00:01:54.840> after<00:01:55.200> being<00:01:55.469> in<00:01:55.709> crochet

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
foundation chain after being in crochet

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.069 
foundation chain after being in crochet
for<00:01:56.429> so<00:01:56.579> many<00:01:56.669> years<00:01:56.999> that<00:01:57.599> it<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:57.869> does

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
for so many years that it really does

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.769 
for so many years that it really does
have<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> better<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.669> and<00:01:59.939> appearance<00:02:00.389> and<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779 
have a better look and appearance and it

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.440 
have a better look and appearance and it
makes<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.169> actually<00:02:01.859> for<00:02:02.069> better<00:02:02.450> starting

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
makes that actually for better starting

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.139 
makes that actually for better starting

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
balance so sometimes the starting chain

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.960 
balance so sometimes the starting chain
is<00:02:17.730> very<00:02:17.910> obvious<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.480> throws<00:02:18.720> your

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
is very obvious and throws your

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.420 
is very obvious and throws your
project<00:02:19.390> out<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.720> balance<00:02:20.020> as<00:02:20.230> far<00:02:20.470> as<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
project out of balance as far as the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.970 
project out of balance as far as the
look<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.970> concerned<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.560> great<00:02:23.770> way<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
look is concerned so it's a great way to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.780 
look is concerned so it's a great way to
determine<00:02:24.700> how<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.470> very<00:02:26.620> easily

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
determine how to to do this very easily

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.270 
determine how to to do this very easily
so<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> great<00:02:28.870> way<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.320> great<00:02:29.380> idea<00:02:30.040> and

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
so this is a great way a great idea and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.310 
so this is a great way a great idea and
something<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.480> should<00:02:31.720> know<00:02:31.750> it's
