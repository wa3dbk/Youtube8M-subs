 soils in the wild this plant 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.000
 grows in mixed sixth 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.179
 cold sparse forests 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.910
 as well as a rattle above equal fields

 Garik in thickets on the outskirts 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.879
 in peat bogs and tundra in culture 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 better option for k below nicks 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.000
 is rich in peat or humus 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.699
 the soil of the plant loves moisture but she 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.489
 should center around the bushes 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.760
 they are under the roots of the prize steel fashion 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.220
 prince dies preparatory 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.040
 work in the spring for digging contribute to 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.540
 a bucket of well rotted manure like 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.000
 option humus 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.000
 river sand and peat as well 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.210
 half a liter jar of ash per 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 every single square meter is fine 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.960
 mixed with soil simultaneously remove the roots

 Nikita Zhenka propagated freshly harvested 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.640
 with names 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.370
 and also by dividing the bush the seeds are sown in 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.010
 box to a depth of 1 centimeter 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.500
 using for planting a mixture of peat and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.780
 beautiful sand 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.409
 the strong box is left to spend the winter under 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.560
 snow spring seeds germinate and at the end 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.920
 poured 7c planted on a permanent 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.210
 place bushes grown this way 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.799
 begin to bear fruit in the third year of life 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.479
 vegetative way is considered more 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.610
 reliable usually 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.350
 use part of the bush with good 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.149
 root match to the desired native land 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.320
 planting material kept wet 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.580
 sawdust in the shade

 princess plant in the spring of 5 May 10 and lay 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.870
 the shadow of 10 September 20 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.370
 for this they make a cage 1 meter wide 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.069
 just before landing the ground 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.480
 I water with hot light pink solution 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.290
 potassium permanganate start working after 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.620
 how the beds dry up from the edges 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.250
 the beds recede 15 centimeters between 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.819
 plants leave 20 centimeters and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.670
 between adjacent stripes 15 centimeters 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.910
 The best time to plant is considered 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.239
 earlier morning or evening seedlings are placed 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.090
 the wells sprinkle with earth squeeze it 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.359
 fingers, thereby increasing contact 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.970
 root system with soil care 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.609
 princess from the ring of spring to the end of summer 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.670
 the ground around the bushes are loosened 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.359
 and weeds are removed , provided that 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.549
 air temperature stays on 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:13.989
 25 degrees above exercise daily 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.739
 the aisle closes foil but van 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.980
 Hall twice in the summer of plants reached 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.950
 age 1 year or more fed up 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.829
 Combine this procedure with watering on 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.660
 each grow does not spend 1 dining room 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.600
 spoon wood ash 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.130
 princess spud and pour under 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.510
 each bush sawdust 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.359
 this technique stimulates active flowering 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.480
 pruning is carried out only if 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.510
 broken and dried twigs 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.890
 senyuu give two-year shoots in the spring 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.890
