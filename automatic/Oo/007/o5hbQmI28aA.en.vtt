 of being subjected to the extraction process 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.050
 pure water from the springs is used 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.750

 temperatures in a magical process 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.300

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.000
 foaming process to increase its 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 porosity this facilitates the exit of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.409
 water in lyophilization and that coffee 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.039
 dissolves easily at the time of your 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.830
 preparation 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.020
 the fuzzy extract is then conducted 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.640
 to a cold room where it is frozen to 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 minus 50 degrees centigrade 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.010
 after being granulated and classified 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.049
 the frozen coffee is subjected to a gentle 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.060
 vacuum heating that allows the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.430
 elimination of the remaining ice in 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.119
 of steam process known also as 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.119
 sublimation 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.230
 the result is an instant product
