think<00:04:27.300> all<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.570> previous<00:04:27.870> downside<00:04:28.199> was

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
think all the previous downside was

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.779 
think all the previous downside was
combined<00:04:28.650> real<00:04:29.009> though<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:29.460> time<00:04:29.639> we're

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
combined real though this time we're

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.850 
combined real though this time we're
taking<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.180> back<00:04:30.539> in<00:04:30.720> time<00:04:30.900> will<00:04:31.409> be<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> story

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
taking you back in time will be a story

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.890 
taking you back in time will be a story
mode<00:04:32.099> that<00:04:32.460> involves<00:04:32.909> time<00:04:33.060> travel<00:04:33.120> we

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
mode that involves time travel we

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.899 
mode that involves time travel we
talking<00:04:34.229> more<00:04:34.349> about<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.620> later<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:35.490> i<00:04:35.699> can

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
talking more about that later but i can

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.640 
talking more about that later but i can
assume<00:04:36.210> perhaps<00:04:36.539> dancing<00:04:36.990> through<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.199> ages

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650
