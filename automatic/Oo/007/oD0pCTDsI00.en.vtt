00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.760
 hola que tal welcome to this video 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.380
 the happy couple where I come to 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.360
 present the products that are going to 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.909
 steal our heart because they are going to leave 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.219
 your eyelashes definitely in the dream 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:14.349
 here I have it , you can not 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.440
 appreciate well on camera as they were 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.330
 my eyelashes I hope yes yes I do not 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.240
 I have many eyelashes with not much 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.430
 volume and 6/2 and I have them long but 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.830
 as with many tabs so we 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.420
 precisely spectacular I have not done 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.340
 no delineated eye makeup 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.450
 nothing I've just done 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.089
 eyebrows 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.159
 I made here my tips happy couple I have my 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.749
 bicrim a little bit of gloss and nothing else very 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.159
 natural so that you could 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.469
 appreciate working with the 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.530
 eyelashes for this happy couple we are going to 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.170
 need the powders of those tics anmat 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.609
 that are quite economical if you do not 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.800
 you have that any other dust 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.260
 Translucent is going to serve you the important 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.300
 is that it is a non-compact loose powder 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.429
 because if it's not going to be a bit difficult and 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.829
 on the other hand I will use the mask 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.739
 of eyelashes and leo harlem de maybelline 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.330
 which is also more or less economical not 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.980
 it's my favorite mask I do not know 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.530
 I recommend but it's the one I have 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.600
 that's why it's the one that I used and this is 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.850
 a guy that I learned here on the internet 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.410
 I liked what was put into practice so 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.390
 It has given me good results and I want it 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.890
 share with you so if you 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.710
 Interested in knowing how they can have 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.990
 more voluminous lashes instantly 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.390
 I want 6 because if the happy couple comes 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.130
 here I am with my eyelashes soaked in 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.290
 this eye has already taken the first step but 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.850
 I'll repeat it in front of the camera 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 so you can see what I'm going to 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.740
 take a little bit of the powder with video 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.910
 translucent pixar matte of those in this 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.040
 chance you can use 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.320
 anyone like me I have the tabs 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.679
 curled now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.159
 Carefully apply powder 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.569
 on the eyelashes do not worry if 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.520
 they have a little on their faces because 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.030
 it's just translucent powder is not going to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.030
 ruin makeup in nothing 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.340
 treat a little bit of excess so you do not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.009
 I will go inside the little 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 enter inside the eye is to enter the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.470
 eye 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.360
 I noticed that there are white eyelashes 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.130
 perfect that's what we want and here 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.570
 I did it a little awkward because 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.190
 facing the camera is a bit uncomfortable 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.380
 but you are going to be able to do it a lot 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 better and the next step is to take 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.600
 our mascara in this case 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.970
 I am using this from my view it 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.070
 Illegal flame line that what it promises is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.740
 long but nothing of volume and what I 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.300
 I want is also a bit of volume like that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.890
 I think it's tips is complemented 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.480
 pretty good this is not my mask 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.390
 favorite, much less everything 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.770
 otherwise then I do not like much but 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.520
 I think for the purposes that 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.950
 we look for serves us so now I'm going to 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.850
 apply the mask as you would 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.910
 traditionally 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.260
 starting from the root 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.260
 and towards the tip 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.400
 I sometimes like to lift a little 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.069
 the bread for you to apply it well 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.980
 from the root but here I am looking at 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.620
 the camera mirror is a bit 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.440
 difficult in this color it looks very nice 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.410
 in these moments precisely but 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.180
 as necessary to apply well the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.490
 mask and here someone applies it with 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.890
 as much dedication as you want and it 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.610
 they fix already they start to see much more 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.610
 thick 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.270
 so it's the root as it is sold by a 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.060
 side 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:42.640
 It is a complete line of no thing 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.489
 then I had some grumo 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.890
 they can take it out since I'm with 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.810
 my eyelashes in both eyes finished 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.569
 here I put my hand so you can see 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.170
 the curvature of the eyelashes are fixed 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.970
 that are quite bulky do not 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.150
 I like how it looks like because the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.950
 so big eyelashes I do not have 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.900
 many tabs if I have them long but 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.970
 not with a lot of volume I hope that you 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.440
 you have liked them to apply this type 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.440
 and see you in a next video
