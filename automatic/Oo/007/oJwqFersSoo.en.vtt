00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.420 
all right so it says it's going to find
the<00:01:34.870> network<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.440> what<00:01:35.620> it's<00:01:35.740> going<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:35.980> say<00:01:36.190> I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
the network is what it's going to say I

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.360 
the network is what it's going to say I
better<00:01:37.240> give<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.420> some<00:01:37.630> more<00:01:37.750> brightness<00:01:41.370> and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
better give it some more brightness and

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.080

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
to fade out but to take care of it I'm

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.310 
to fade out but to take care of it I'm
going<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.820> go<00:01:48.970> up<00:01:49.240> there<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.050> already

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
going to go up there it is I already

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.270 
going to go up there it is I already
went<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.500> LTE<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.590> does<00:01:53.800> work<00:01:54.040> on

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
went to LTE so this does work on

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.000 
went to LTE so this does work on
t-mobile's<00:01:55.000> network<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:56.140> axe<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.590> factory

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
t-mobile's network this axe is factory

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.719 
t-mobile's network this axe is factory
unlocked<00:01:57.370> so<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.030> go<00:01:58.210> back<00:01:58.330> down<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.660> about

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
unlocked so I go back down to about

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.900 
unlocked so I go back down to about
Network<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.229> go

good signal for what any company let's

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.930 
good signal for what any company let's
do<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> speed<00:02:14.110> test<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:18.459> pretty<00:02:18.700> cool<00:02:18.880> that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
do a speed test it's pretty cool that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.060 
do a speed test it's pretty cool that
Verizon<00:02:19.720> has<00:02:19.989> all<00:02:20.170> their<00:02:20.320> phones<00:02:20.560> factory

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
Verizon has all their phones factory

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
Verizon has all their phones factory
unlocked<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.280> that's<00:02:24.430> pretty<00:02:24.640> good<00:02:24.790> speeds

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
unlocked so that's pretty good speeds

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.520 
unlocked so that's pretty good speeds
here<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.540> when<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.750> leave<00:02:25.930> my<00:02:26.020> house<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.350> get

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
like 30 or 40 you probably see me post

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.210 
like 30 or 40 you probably see me post
them<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.480> Twitter<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:30.370> LTE<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:32.200> right<00:02:32.620> so

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
them on Twitter but LTE all right so

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.550 
them on Twitter but LTE all right so
this<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.810> unlocked<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:36.840> was<00:02:37.840> doing<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.140> APN

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
this is unlocked I was doing the APN

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.380 
this is unlocked I was doing the APN
settings<00:02:38.590> I'll<00:02:39.400> let<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.700> see<00:02:39.820> what<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> APN

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
settings I'll let you see what the APN

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.340 
settings I'll let you see what the APN
settings<00:02:40.420> looks<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.080> because<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.290> know

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
settings looks like because I know

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.600 
settings looks like because I know
someone's<00:02:41.769> probably<00:02:41.980> gonna<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> try

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
someone's probably gonna want to try

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.320 
someone's probably gonna want to try
this<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.130> LTE<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.880> t-mobile

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
this but it is on LTE and it is t-mobile

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.750 
this but it is on LTE and it is t-mobile
so<00:02:47.170> we're<00:02:47.320> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> go<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.130> APN

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
so we're going to go into the APN

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.820 
so we're going to go into the APN
settings<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.959> have<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.170> go<00:02:50.230> into<00:02:50.350> mobile<00:02:50.530> data

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
settings you have to go into mobile data

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.009 
settings you have to go into mobile data

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
and it's grayed out for me now because I

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.640 
and it's grayed out for me now because I
have<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:57.420> cancel<00:02:58.420> I'll<00:02:58.959> go<00:02:59.140> back<00:02:59.320> to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
have it in there cancel I'll go back to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.830 
have it in there cancel I'll go back to
