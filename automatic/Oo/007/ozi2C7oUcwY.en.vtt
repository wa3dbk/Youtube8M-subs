00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.529
 I do not know if you whine 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 even the type of person since itself 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.990
 itself as war would designate or 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.130
 maybe even as a nerd but me 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.880
 Personally, I would think of it as a war 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.730
 describe 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.189
 and somehow nobody ever knows what he's telling me 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 should give as a birthday or too 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.980
 something and that's why I have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 thought hey valentin we do 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.000
 Just a list of things you can 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 can not give a present now 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 especially for me because I have a lot 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.360
 things of that already have but especially 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.710
 for you if you have friends the gags 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.540
 Are you going to want to give something then 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.370
 you can use this video directly as yours 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 as your favorite agree on youtube 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.790
 in every time he in br pay volt 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.899
 do you come back to this video and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 Find a gift for her there 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.350
 can give away a thing the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 Every use is memory space and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.700
 Memory space is often very good in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.649
 form of eg sd cards for cell phones and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 cameras and here I have two things 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.329
 of you number one is a 32gb 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 class 10 sdhc micro sd card so one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.390
 which one, for example, in his cellphone 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 pensions no cent samsung galaxy s 5 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 or such a cell phone included 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.299
 adapter is synonymous as normal 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 memory card usable or directly for 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.409
 three euros more a 64gb class 10 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 memory card which I also own 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.820
 have and so you can a gig 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.070
 make a nice gift on this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
 memory card can then gives the me 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 maybe give a gift right away 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.350
 few videos of his parrot ar.drone 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.970
 to record a drone which one with his 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.409
 mobile phone remote control can by wlan 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.119
 just works a monkey horny 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.500
 thing is if your friend but also 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.240
 maybe outside nature is maybe too 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 Travel a bit and then give 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.650
 Give him a gorillapod, yes 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.900
 Tripod where you can bend your legs 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.340
 and that can hang on trees at all 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.659
 you can shape possible things to it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 that somehow you always have a stable one 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 stop for the camera maybe 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 is your friend but also a funny one 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
 We wanted to buy a title 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.790
 then donate a t shirt what the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 evolution of the geeks shows so 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.899
 from the monkey of the ever on 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.070
 But sometime stands up 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.119
 and then sit down again at the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.649
 to be a computer 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.719
 maybe your friend is also him 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.040
 all for example console gamer sits 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.930
 So more on the tv 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.270
 then give him a google chrome 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 This is a small stick of one 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 normal tv in a smart like 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.430
 morphs on the new youtube videos 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.200
 can play from his mobile our 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.180
 utah from google chrome everything possible 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.459
 can stream to the tv and that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.819
 for him very very cheap price or 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.379
 but he uses loudspeakers on the television 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.609
 but sometimes you also want to gamble or 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.500
 maybe music could give it to him 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.950
 but a few headphones how about it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.530
 example with the audio technica chf 50 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.359
 ickx and those are really good sounding 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.219
 headphones for a very reasonable price 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.659
 and if you said okay all the way 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.790
 I do not have money then let that go 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.049
 Detachable cable and buy through the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.439
 predecessor without the xda thm 50 audio 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.879
 technica thm 50 mx which are about 30 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 Although cheaper have no euro 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.359
 removable cable sound but almost 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.859
 right the same and top headphones are the 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.060
 I also use myself maybe 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.419
 Your friend, yes, rather someone of the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.829
 things and then maybe 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.689
 also want to have a headset then 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.909
 send him the biodynamic custom 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.609
 and pro are super awesome 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.810
 headphones and there you can later everything 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.579
 possible change that look like the others 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.540
 you can do a headset what you too 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.099
 has linked with below in the video 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.709
 description with turn and has 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.209
 next to it a headset and well out of it can 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.129
 He then does what he does, so to speak 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.319
 but she or she wants it if that's all 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.699
 nothing for your friend is then gives 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.069
 Just give him an Amazon coupon 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.139
 in the form of a gift box or a 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.519
 Gift card also linked below 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.870
 in the video description and there could be 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.709
 choose how much worth having 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.540
 you should really be able to do that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.459
 not just kind of give somehow 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.650
 coupon as a few lines code 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.419
 or so but really as a card or 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.280
 as a small gift box and if yours 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.439

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.699
