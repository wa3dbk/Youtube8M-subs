00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.059
 yes it bangs and crashes and left and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.219
 on the right there is to the disturbance and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.549
 Particle effects and online players 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.920
 soldiers class vehicles aircraft 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.570
 rocket launcher gunfire fantastic 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.140
 I'm back in battlefield 3 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.939
 mode 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.859
 the game is a lot of fun online 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.199
 when I'm docking now 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.740
 new dcc endgame not so much ripped 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.449
 that would have to forgive me something 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.859
 then everything is new in the opposite direction 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.660
 I have the feeling so Beck missing because comes 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.219
 just still in regular train 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 four times another vehicle 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.770
 again a weapon what is this time 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.510
 so covered 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 again four cards again vehicles 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 Well it is exactly 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.399
 the same package must have four cards 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.489
 here we see one of them in rush mode 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 the pipeline in winter there is still one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.100
 few more we see all in the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 History of the video There are three new ones 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.640
 vehicles a humvee with rocket launcher 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 a light anti-aircraft tank and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.080
 Of course, completely new and spectacular 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.950
 motorcycles and bikes and bikes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.090
 I was really looking forward to that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 and I was very skeptical 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.860
 behind it drives 1h since I was already sets 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 the forwarder will control everything 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 cool idea is but I am quite pleased 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.680
 the things are fun but later 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.930
 moreover, of course, is whole 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.530
 classic new orders new medals 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 or dog tags of the day 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 we will see dropshipping in later too 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 action which is also a bit of movement in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.509
 the whole thing brings and just the whole 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.880
 had done properly 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.290
 I think like other dlcs directs 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 the thing on the console under the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.659
 Low player limit one can on ps3 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.850
 and xbox has only 24 players 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 play on pc with 32 or on the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 large versions of the maps with 64 the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.399
 makes much more fun you meet more 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.600
 people both figuratively and literally 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.220
 sense 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.229
 between the eyes is red and also 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.020
 personally very firmly audience again 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.880
 to explain 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.170
 the maps in some of the others 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 dlcs have that a bit already 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.729
 theme times classic maps recycle times 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.360
 very vertical times very big like them 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.090
 trained 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.500
 they are quite outstretched but to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.209
 I'll tell you more if that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.959
 mopeds to see his game are here 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.000
 very briefly one of the new modes 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.220
 Air priority First premise is there 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.560
 only planes so jets and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.030
 one romps around a few points 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.640
 those in the air float so zeppelin and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.920
 try to take it by flying around 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.989
 of course the opposing team is trying that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.459
 to prevent and so then burns 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.340
 funny dogfight or that is finally 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.590
 a chance to level the jets because 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.750
 It was quite tricky in the game 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.069
 because the things stop for the beginning 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.510
 are useful until you get the carbons 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.040
 Special weapons unlocked here 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.350
 you just need and zeppelin around 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 Flies gets its flags 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.970
 taken points a nice thing 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 but still too heavy for me though 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.720
 you do not have every element of 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.340
 Battlefield 3 can be me 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.019
 Airplanes just too tricky they can 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.579
 good fly but I get nothing from 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.570
 sky 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.769
 ok tob myself in other modes of but 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.530
 Nice is in there and I am 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.660
 impressed how good some of the opponents 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.609
 and players can do that's it 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.230
 Impressive if you are so with 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.359
 artful maneuvers brought from the air 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.690
 becomes 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.890
 this internet sugar 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.080
 I do not want to be prejudiced right now 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.940
 confirm to women but yes me 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.560
 I'm also such a 3d idiot as far as that is concerned 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.580
 So here we see the dropshipping 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 Possibility exists on one of the maps 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.600
 or even on 2 I got it on the plus 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.890
 you can unlock it for that 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.230
 own team with my right point 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.460
 takes and then not only directly into 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.920
 play in as a parachutist 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.570
 but also direct one 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.500
 light armor from this job already 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.950
 let drop 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.340
 funny also brings a lot of momentum into the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.750
 game 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.190
 and now here again to the cards we 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.930
 all are relatively open, all relative 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.060
 flat and there is plenty 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 sneak paths with which one having a jeep 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.690
 not getting along so well but where that is 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.190
 moped is the best choice and that 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.540
 is pretty fun with 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.130
 high speed through the undergrowth 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.050
 boarded anyone off the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.560
 cut very fast from a to b 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.570
 come 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.000
 that's really cool otherwise they are 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.220
 classic modes is still capture 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.750
 the flag and that same air authority is 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.150
 the classic gameplay on one quickly 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.400
 or in conquest that's fun that's 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.980
 Battlefield has not been that much 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.290
 done and it is now at all four 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.060
 Maps are open terrain maps so it 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.830
 there is no klaus bath kombat you have it 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.180
 very much with vehicles very much with 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.110
 the sniper and the rocket launcher 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.640
 to do classes 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.460
 if that's not the case then it is 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.810
 maybe the dlc is not for you though 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.810
 riding a moped that's nice 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.710
 then finally dirtbike 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.240
 and you can do high city so um 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:51.470
 willi sounds very excited oh I am 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.140
 just inside 12 the physics of physics 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.040
 could a tick be more handy feel it 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.690
 Sometimes so different for the 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 ground contact is not there because flies 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.350
 airplane backwards I have that now 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.490
 just taken with you because you 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.750
 was not surprised and that goes 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.360
 already it is not perfect that 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.180
 Motorcycling but it is well controllable 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.980
 it works it works very well too 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.470
 when they feel a bit more spectacular 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.550
 you could jump and feel great 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.020
 and a lot of time on the motorcycle 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.560
 do not waste your team 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.520
 but bring fun but have fun for sure 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.870
 I like it but I have to say it has 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.090
 really what you have a few colleagues 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.160
 has the convoy in a street, so to speak 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.530
 down on the new one 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.510
 It's really great cards 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.160
 suitable also a smaller congo 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.690
 to start and drive from a to b 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.060
 just in capture the flag mode 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.200
 that has something of team if 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.120
 Put them together with some buddies 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.860
 with lightning fast in the opponent's base 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.530
 drives the defense off 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.730
 and sees the flag snaps though 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.870
 is catching the flag too 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.010
 a little bit different than you 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.420
 for example, from a classic 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.220
 shooter is used to here you have to 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.440
 namely standing around the flag around it 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.570
 and take the flag as much as 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.040
 a checkpoint in the remaining modes 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.660
 I think that's a bit silly 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.490
 he would have been even more fun if 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.140
 you can really take them so 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.850
 Just run over it you have it or 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.100
 the game would be much too out of place 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.970
 because way too open and too few players 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.890
 I dont know 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.630
 but yes through the wild shreds sets 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.910
 an older card 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.520
 I think that suits the drop very well 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.250
 chips depreciate the armor yes so true 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.860
 Overall, it is the rounder dlcs with 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.490
 Arma kill does not go so well 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.870
 canceled 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.900
 The maps were just too much for that 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.670
 huge on console then just got it 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.890
 I spend 90 percent of my time on mine 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.780
 Player and opponent waited for that here 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.130
 makes all in all are the times 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.170
 individual elements play well 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.160
 in one another 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.810
 the whole result can be seen 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.810
 I have had fun with it 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.600
 and now here 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.770
 a great guy without the weapon to create 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.070
 directly through the wall 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:04.450
 really awesome me, love me 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.690
 Sebastian rod can pass through walls 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.690
 shoots
