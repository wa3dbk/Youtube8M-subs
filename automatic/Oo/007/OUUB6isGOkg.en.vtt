00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello good to all we bring you the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.290
 tutorial on how to make the coaster that is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.690
 the false ghost that is to do like that 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 you step on but do not step on then basically 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.970
 that can be done by jumping out of a world 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.220
 to another or when you're making a 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.690
 stride another such and then you put a one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.470
 of those because it's pretty decorative 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.150
 and it's pretty good 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.650
 I am emilio would be explained in Spanish 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 in English 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.829
 well the booster that the Spanish would be 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.079
 ghost step although it sounds a little 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:53.649
 weird because I've never heard it is 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:55.059
 basically for that to decorate is very 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.640
 simple or this tutorial is going to be 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.989
 rather short is instead of making a 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.370
 normal stride when 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.440
 come running and fall with the same 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.820
 standing with the other foot 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.619
 you fall with himself you have to do more 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.380
 effort because you have to jump 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.829
 enough with this one to be able 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 later another thing that is pretty 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.140
 important is the other leg that 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.289
 you leave in the air because that first one goes 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.789
 forwards and then you do as a 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.240
 push back to catch more 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.240
 speed 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.280
 and that way jumping over booster 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 they 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.170
 Well, that's just like making a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.000
 invisible step in the air or if you step on and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.800
 you get out of the air and that's it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.990
 and he was doing all the boxster 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.310
 can be applied for example for when 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.440
 jump from one place to another make a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.960
 webster that's pretty useful there's 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.760
 people who come running is high face 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.770
 foot and from there to make a web 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.709
 of the forward then basically 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.930
 the likes are like when you make a 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.209
 pirouette or when you click is 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.400
 simply to join another trick is not 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.890
 It is not a trick that in itself is very 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.300
 difficult but it's like a union of a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.520
 thing to another if you want to do things 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.560
 followed and well this is still everything 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.790
 I hope you liked that I have 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.250
 helped this tutorial even be very 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.810
 short and it's not practical to jump 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.810
 more further and such 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.790
 on 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.290
 weinstein by 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.740
 webster beijing 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.700
 the boat with them 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.540
 to nobody
