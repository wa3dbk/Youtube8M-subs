this on sections underneath to prevent a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
this on sections underneath to prevent a
bump<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> line<00:00:29.179> as<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.510> work<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> head

bump in the line as you work up the head

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.370 
bump in the line as you work up the head
and<00:00:31.560> add<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.189> hair<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.840> don't<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.110> need

and add more hair you don't really need
to<00:00:34.590> account<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.280> ear<00:00:35.460> anymore<00:00:37.550> what<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
to account for the ear anymore what you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.930 
to account for the ear anymore what you
do<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.300> cut<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.410> line<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> connect<00:00:41.730> all

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
do is cut on your line and connect all

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.740 
do is cut on your line and connect all
the<00:00:42.180> dots<00:00:42.649> work<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.950> line<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.640> notice<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the dots work that line and notice that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
the dots work that line and notice that
I'm<00:00:45.899> pulling<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.410> downward<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> hair

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
I'm pulling it downward the way the hair

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
I'm pulling it downward the way the hair
wants<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> fall<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> turning<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.800> fingers<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
wants to fall and turning my fingers to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.410 
wants to fall and turning my fingers to
make<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> line<00:00:52.489> even<00:00:53.489> though<00:00:53.850> her<00:00:54.030> hair<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
make the line even though her hair is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.410 
make the line even though her hair is
very<00:00:54.510> thick<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:55.550> pulling<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.699> downward

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
very thick I'm pulling this downward

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.410 
very thick I'm pulling this downward
because<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.230> want<00:00:58.680> an<00:00:58.770> exaggerated<00:00:59.730> sense<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
because I want an exaggerated sense of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.160 
because I want an exaggerated sense of
thickness<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.949> bottom<00:01:02.359> now<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.629> could

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
thickness on the bottom now I could

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
thickness on the bottom now I could
elevate<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.270> did<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.810> would

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
elevate it a bit and if I did I would

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
elevate it a bit and if I did I would
get<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.880> three-dimensional<00:01:08.880> shape

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
get a much more three-dimensional shape

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
get a much more three-dimensional shape
than<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.200> intend<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:12.200> intend<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
than what I intend I intend to get a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.280 
than what I intend I intend to get a
more<00:01:13.740> broom<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.369> effect<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
more broom like effect and I do this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.539 
more broom like effect and I do this
again<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.189> pulling<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> down<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.650> also<00:01:19.650> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
again by pulling it down and also with

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.719 
again by pulling it down and also with
very<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:21.360> tension<00:01:21.890> were<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> pull<00:01:23.490> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
very little tension were I to pull this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.990 
very little tension were I to pull this
tight<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.479> stretch<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.700> would

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
tight and stretch it then it would

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.780 
tight and stretch it then it would
expand<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.799> pressure

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
expand and I would get a pressure

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.469 
expand and I would get a pressure
graduated<00:01:30.780> shape<00:01:31.500> rather<00:01:32.400> than<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.210> broom

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
graduated shape rather than the broom

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
graduated shape rather than the broom
like<00:01:33.720> shape<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> see

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like shape that we're going to see

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.680 
like shape that we're going to see
coming<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.430> here

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.170 

we'll<00:01:42.690> blast<00:01:42.900> some<00:01:43.230> of<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.440> water<00:01:43.680> away<00:01:44.180> hit

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
we'll blast some of this water away hit

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.960 
we'll blast some of this water away hit
it<00:01:45.300> with<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.480> flat<00:01:45.780> iron<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.160> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it with a flat iron so you can see the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
it with a flat iron so you can see the
lack<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> elevation<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.370> get<00:01:50.700> again<00:01:51.630> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
lack of elevation that I get again this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.160 
lack of elevation that I get again this
is<00:01:52.140> by<00:01:52.290> pulling<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.760> angling<00:01:54.450> my

is by pulling it down and angling my
fingers<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.150> tension
