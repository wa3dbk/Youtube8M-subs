00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
quite enough that it won't slip and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.610 
quite enough that it won't slip and
slide<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.720> did<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.960> other<00:02:24.990> day<00:02:25.290> okay

the Mucca is still doing an outstanding

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.470 
the Mucca is still doing an outstanding
job<00:07:24.870> it's<00:07:25.440> burning<00:07:25.830> clean<00:07:26.070> it's<00:07:26.790> burning<00:07:27.150> very

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480 
job it's burning clean it's burning very

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.730 
job it's burning clean it's burning very
hot<00:07:27.860> 15800<00:07:28.860> BTU<00:07:29.610> supposedly<00:07:30.240> up<00:07:30.360> to<00:07:30.540> that<00:07:30.740> and

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
hot 15800 BTU supposedly up to that and

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.220 
hot 15800 BTU supposedly up to that and
this<00:07:31.830> is<00:07:32.040> an<00:07:32.190> old<00:07:32.370> timer<00:07:32.670> for<00:07:33.000> 2060<00:07:33.660> as<00:07:33.810> I<00:07:33.990> said

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
this is an old timer for 2060 as I said

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.100 
this is an old timer for 2060 as I said
all<00:07:34.860> three<00:07:35.160> burners<00:07:35.490> going<00:07:35.730> my<00:07:36.600> primary

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
all three burners going my primary

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.900 
all three burners going my primary
reason<00:07:37.650> for<00:07:37.680> getting<00:07:38.070> all<00:07:38.190> the<00:07:38.340> stoves<00:07:38.580> going

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
reason for getting all the stoves going

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.460 
reason for getting all the stoves going
was<00:07:39.120> because<00:07:39.420> I<00:07:39.570> wanted<00:07:39.840> to<00:07:39.930> have<00:07:40.050> all<00:07:40.080> the

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470 
was because I wanted to have all the

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.600 
was because I wanted to have all the
water<00:07:40.680> boiling<00:07:41.040> in<00:07:41.630> advance

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:43.610 
water boiling in advance

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.040 
water boiling in advance
so

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
so

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.860 
so
I<00:07:45.159> think<00:07:46.159> that's<00:07:46.340> probably<00:07:46.520> about<00:07:46.729> it<00:07:46.970> I've

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870 
I think that's probably about it I've

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.749 
I think that's probably about it I've
gotta<00:07:48.139> say<00:07:48.409> this<00:07:48.650> test<00:07:48.949> has<00:07:49.159> convinced<00:07:49.639> me

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 
gotta say this test has convinced me

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.969 
gotta say this test has convinced me
that<00:07:50.030> the<00:07:50.449> Mucca<00:07:50.750> does<00:07:50.930> not<00:07:51.139> need<00:07:51.349> any<00:07:51.680> slots

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:51.979 
that the Mucca does not need any slots

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.730 
that the Mucca does not need any slots
in<00:07:52.460> the<00:07:52.789> top<00:07:53.030> of<00:07:53.449> the<00:07:53.599> pot<00:07:53.810> support<00:07:54.229> it<00:07:54.470> does

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:54.740 
in the top of the pot support it does
