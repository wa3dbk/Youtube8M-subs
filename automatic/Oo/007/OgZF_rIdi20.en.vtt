00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.540
 Then it's only you and my 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.630
 money 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.730
 the link is below in the description under 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.530
 spent I 've seen in my life working 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 I'm there in front of the computer. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.119
 working from an early age, including having a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 working meeting at 7:00 a.m. 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 hours should already you should be 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.320
 in this video or not I do not know at last I 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 I am seen in my life and I could take a dvd 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.859
 Look at the channel, right? 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 how ta k not going as she or I or 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 looking like that while also in the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.160
 channel video account so catching up 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.840
 video that went well the staff liked and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 said that it was also legal where the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.030
 People say that the video is Dad 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.460
 So I'll go step to see that. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.430
 TV channel this month your channel could 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.539
 hit a million views this month 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 the 1 million views of this hand cement 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 It's absurd and that's all thanks to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.160
 You and I have never gotten to that point in the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 channel has not reached this level is very 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 has commented that this was thanks to the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.809
 channel content that has improved dramatically 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.729
 in recent months 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 I'm glad you liked the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.080
 are showing that they are watching 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 only this one will not only be for 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 to thank and to be able to stay 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
 Talking fuck, just happy command. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 the damn 4 to celebrate this brand in the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.670
 channel and that's why you made this video 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 that I'm going to make a 200 thousand draw 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.450
 with this new fifa 15 independent of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.340
 platform you are young 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 At first on twitter I had spoken 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.119
 that the winner would choose the platform 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.040
 civic on pc xbox 360 and playstation 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.720
 but then I was thinking about doing it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.670
 rather than choosing one 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.049
 winner and if I win I will choose 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 platform that make them up 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.020
 I think you deserve that I choose 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.430
 three winners and each one can be 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 from a different platform 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.689
 so I 'll choose the winner to win 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.549
 bosco independent play station winner 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.799
 of search 34 and I will choose the winner 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.540
 for xbox also different and xbox 36010 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.100
 for only then will we have a ready 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.899

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.470

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.100
