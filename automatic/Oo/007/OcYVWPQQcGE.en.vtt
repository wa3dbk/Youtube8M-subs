we<00:00:17.340> all<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.670> intuition<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
we all have intuition we just have to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
we all have intuition we just have to
use<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.369> more<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.580> use<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.210> sharper

use it the more you use it the sharper
it<00:00:21.779> gets<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.490> pretty<00:00:23.490> soon<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.029> become

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with that on this video I know that the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580 
with that on this video I know that the
earth<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.219> flat<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.140> struck<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
earth is flat and I know that I struck a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.479 
earth is flat and I know that I struck a
nerve<00:00:47.239> because<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> actions<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> saw

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
nerve because of the actions that I saw

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.389 
nerve because of the actions that I saw
on<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> video<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.039> video

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
on a video that I made it was a video

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
on a video that I made it was a video
called<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> plains<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.690> help<00:00:54.899> prove<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
called the plains can help prove the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.580 
called the plains can help prove the
plane<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:57.109> actually<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.140> caught<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> little

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
plane and actually I caught a little

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
plane and actually I caught a little
 for<00:00:59.280> using<00:00:59.670> duh<00:00:59.940> plane<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> was

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
 for using duh plane but I was

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.210 
 for using duh plane but I was
trying<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.489> clever<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.210> tattoos<00:01:03.690> verbage

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
trying to be clever this tattoos verbage

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
trying to be clever this tattoos verbage
don't<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> again<00:01:06.080> but<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> definitely

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
don't do that again but it definitely

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.179 
don't do that again but it definitely
brought<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> chills<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.820> force<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
brought the chills out in force and this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.240 
brought the chills out in force and this
was<00:01:11.369> my<00:01:11.549> second<00:01:12.030> video<00:01:12.150> I've<00:01:12.600> made<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
was my second video I've made for this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
was my second video I've made for this
is<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> only<00:01:14.700> video<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.509> getting<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
is the only video that's getting this

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
is the only video that's getting this
kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.259> attention<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> knew<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.750> hit

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
kind of attention so I knew that I hit

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.350 
kind of attention so I knew that I hit
on<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.930> nerve<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.619> knew<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.759> struck<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> nerve

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
on a nerve I knew that I struck a nerve

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.870 
on a nerve I knew that I struck a nerve
and<00:01:21.600> these<00:01:21.720> guys<00:01:21.930> even<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.530> networks<00:01:23.100> they

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and these guys even have networks they

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.590 
and these guys even have networks they
get<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.270> argue<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
get on and they you know argue with you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.890 
get on and they you know argue with you
waste<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.140> time<00:01:28.759> insult<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.299> stuff<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
waste your time insult you and stuff and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.130 
waste your time insult you and stuff and
then<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.290> share<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.770> video<00:01:32.960> does<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
then they share your video does that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.760 
then they share your video does that
make<00:01:34.350> sense

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
make sense

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.660 
make sense
yes<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> network<00:01:37.640> there<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
yes because they have a network there a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
yes because they have a network there a
network<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.420> shills<00:01:39.890> probably<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.009> former

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
network of shills probably all former

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.429 
network of shills probably all former
NASA<00:01:41.759> shields<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> NASA<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> going

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
NASA shields and now that NASA is going

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.210 
NASA shields and now that NASA is going
down<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.979> flames<00:01:44.270> they're<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.450> jumping<00:01:46.220> ship

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
down in flames they're all jumping ship

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.569 
down in flames they're all jumping ship
and<00:01:47.460> working<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> flat<00:01:48.840> earthers<00:01:49.579> but

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and working on the flat earthers but

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.520 
and working on the flat earthers but
this<00:01:51.180> video<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.600> made<00:01:53.630> basically<00:01:54.630> checked<00:01:55.320> out

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this video I made basically checked out

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.910 
this video I made basically checked out
all<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.290> flights<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> southern

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
all the flights in the southern

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.499 
all the flights in the southern
hemisphere<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.729> checking<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.119> kinds<00:02:00.450> of

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
hemisphere I was checking all kinds of

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
hemisphere I was checking all kinds of
different<00:02:00.689> cities

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
different cities

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.840 
different cities
and<00:02:03.799> just<00:02:04.799> checking<00:02:05.130> their<00:02:05.280> routes<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and just checking their routes and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.570 
and just checking their routes and
mapping<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.840> Google<00:02:07.260> Maps<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.799> then

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
mapping them on Google Maps and then

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.930 
mapping them on Google Maps and then
mapping<00:02:08.970> them<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> flat<00:02:09.539> earth<00:02:09.569> map<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
mapping them on a flat earth map and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.820 
mapping them on a flat earth map and
what<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> showed<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.569> was<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.080> Flat<00:02:13.350> Earth<00:02:13.380> Map

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
what it showed me was the Flat Earth Map

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.199 
what it showed me was the Flat Earth Map
routes<00:02:14.160> made<00:02:14.610> sense<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.670> Google<00:02:18.030> Map

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
routes made sense and the the Google Map

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.960 
routes made sense and the the Google Map
ones<00:02:18.510> didn't<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:20.130> know<00:02:20.280> they<00:02:20.489> threw<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.880> a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
ones didn't you know they threw in a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.380 
ones didn't you know they threw in a
couple<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.420> non<00:02:21.870> stops<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.390> one

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
couple of non stops here and there one

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.309 
couple of non stops here and there one
usually<00:02:25.100> for<00:02:26.100> each<00:02:26.569> flight<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.870> looked<00:02:28.140> at

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
usually for each flight that I looked at

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.900 
usually for each flight that I looked at
if<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.470> those<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.500> fake<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.280> mean<00:02:32.730> they

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
if that and those are fake I mean they

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.520 
if that and those are fake I mean they
have<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.270> be<00:02:33.390> fake<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.020> look<00:02:34.290> at<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
have to be fake when you look at the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.830 
have to be fake when you look at the
mileage<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:35.370> mileage<00:02:35.730> doubles<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:36.570> all<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
mileage the mileage doubles for all the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.199 
mileage the mileage doubles for all the
other<00:02:36.989> flights<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.709> they<00:02:38.550> all<00:02:38.730> go<00:02:38.940> into<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
other flights and they all go into the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.990 
other flights and they all go into the
northern<00:02:39.630> hemisphere<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.320> come<00:02:40.530> back<00:02:40.680> down

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
northern hemisphere and come back down

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.479 
northern hemisphere and come back down
so<00:02:42.000> none<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.450> makes<00:02:42.690> sense<00:02:42.989> when<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.489> plot

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
so none of it makes sense when you plot

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.340 
so none of it makes sense when you plot
it<00:02:44.700> out<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:46.819> I'm<00:02:47.819> using<00:02:48.120> my<00:02:48.360> intuition<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.110> say

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it out and I'm using my intuition to say

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.580 
it out and I'm using my intuition to say
that<00:02:49.920> yes<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.300> thing<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.870> earth<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.260> flat

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
that yes for one thing the earth is flat

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.210 
that yes for one thing the earth is flat
