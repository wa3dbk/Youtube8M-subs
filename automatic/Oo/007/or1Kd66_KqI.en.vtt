00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.540
 the bearded snow chain grizzlys 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.220
 noscript is delivered in a box 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.460
 everything needed for the assembly 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.230
 is in the packaging 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.210
 the scope of delivery includes two fields 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 rings the corresponding number of 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 chains strict and the tool bag in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 scope of delivery is also the approval 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
 Certificate for the snow chain included 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.399
 it is required the certificate at 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 to guide the rides 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.660
 on the back of the certificate 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.350
 is the assembly instructions for 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.120
 the grizzlys no grip the rims rings 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.480
 should be already before winter 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.910
 be mounted to an optimal stop 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 to ensure the rim is before 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 to insert the field ring to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.379
 cleaning with the help of asparagus is the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 ring compressed and into the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.750
 rim is inserted the ring becomes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.230
 Turned up the safety bar over the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.720
 valve of the wheel is now the will 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.750
 valve protection deferred until this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.909
 inner rim is located on the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.360
 spanner mother, the ring is so spread 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.680
 that he is firmly clamped in the rim 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 the mother should be with the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.759
 wrench firmly tightened 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.759
 will be about 70 newton meters 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.400
 she will be with a counterpart mother 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.229
 secured as the valve protection 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 exactly opposite the clamping device 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.409
 is located at the rink rink one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.590
 unbeaten on the grizzlys no grip met 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.270
 highest demands on safety 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 because the stainless steel ring is only one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.979
 how shape of the rim flange sun has to fit 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.330
 the spanner mother about two to three times 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.009
 be followed 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.300
 the first time after about 50 kilometers 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.880
 the chain bags should be in 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
 passenger footwell be stored with it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.310
 They are warm and dry during assembly 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.310
 are 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.160
 the chains are used to assemble the chains 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.040
 Strictly laid one over the wheel 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.230
 ideally starting from the top is started 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.599
 the help of the hook will skew the chains 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.330
 still pulled by the fields and on 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.310
 inner tension hook hooked on the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.489
 The other end of the chain will be on one of the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.470
 outer hook hung not needed 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.489
 chain links please at the inner hook 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.160
 skip 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.989
 in the lower part of the wheel are the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.989
 chains strict from the inside out 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.209
 through the rim holes created with the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.519
 crank the chains are just strict 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.730
 so far as to turn them off 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.160
 More can not hang out the strict ones 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.650
 be tense between mature and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.849
 Chain should be about four to five fingers 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.459
 be wide space 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.950
 at the number of inserts area 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:14.489
 the use as a driving aid from three 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.650
 chains strict bees as traction help 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.940
 Five chains are more stringent than more advanced 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 traction help available 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.889
 with snow chains are all ten 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.959
 strict to assemble new chains 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.870
 strict can be mounted in the stand 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.880
 even in the locked state is the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.489
 grizzlys no grip mountable 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.590
 another note for the care after the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.510
 the chains should be strict 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.139
 Spinning facilities always turned back 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.450
 become 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.220
 after the season, it is recommended the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.140
 to remove rim rings 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.350
 then the ring with warm water 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.850
 clean thoroughly and dry well 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.850
 hang the rings best 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.730
 No
