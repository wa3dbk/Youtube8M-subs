apartment I thought that I would finish
off<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> living<00:00:09.330> room<00:00:09.450> today<00:00:09.870> because<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
off the living room today because I

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.470 
off the living room today because I
don't<00:00:11.490> know<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.820> looking<00:00:12.059> really<00:00:12.090> bear

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
don't know it was looking really bear

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.270 
don't know it was looking really bear
and<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.929> had<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.320> mind<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> knew<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> wanted

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and I had in mind what I knew I wanted

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160 
and I had in mind what I knew I wanted
to<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> thought<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.599> would<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.839> go

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

to do and so I thought I would just go
ahead<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.820> throw<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.090> my<00:00:18.270> creative<00:00:18.779> ideas

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's called the electric apartment not
just<00:01:17.939> because<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> colors<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:18.900> also

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
just because of the colors but also

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859 
just because of the colors but also
because<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> design<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:21.270> lay<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because of the design they lay out the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.800 
because of the design they lay out the
form<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.259> everything<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.299> what<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> did<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
form at everything so what I did was I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
form at everything so what I did was I
put<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> column<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> could<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
put that column there so I could put the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
put that column there so I could put the
television<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> thought

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
television on it and then I thought

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
television on it and then I thought
would<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.770> cool<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
would be really cool to have it as a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
would be really cool to have it as a
coat<00:01:30.270> rack<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> coat<00:01:31.799> rack<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.009> room

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
coat rack or what a coat rack a room

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
coat rack or what a coat rack a room
originally<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> thought<00:01:33.060> let's<00:01:33.600> make<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
originally I thought let's make it a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
originally I thought let's make it a
bathroom<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:35.070> cool<00:01:35.369> middle<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
bathroom like a really cool middle of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450 
bathroom like a really cool middle of
the<00:01:36.030> room<00:01:36.180> bathroom<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.070> too<00:01:38.220> small

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the room bathroom but it was too small

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.740 
the room bathroom but it was too small
and<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.820> made<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:39.210> bigger<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.630> would

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and if I made it any bigger it would

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.140 
and if I made it any bigger it would
