I'm<00:00:08.170> currently<00:00:08.470> making<00:00:08.860> this<00:00:09.160> Electric's

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
I'm currently making this Electric's

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.390 
I'm currently making this Electric's
panel<00:00:10.330> for<00:00:10.480> my<00:00:10.570> CNC<00:00:11.050> mill<00:00:11.260> I've<00:00:11.469> drawn<00:00:12.070> up<00:00:12.219> in

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
panel for my CNC mill I've drawn up in

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.420 
panel for my CNC mill I've drawn up in
CAD<00:00:12.639> and<00:00:12.850> produced<00:00:13.300> a<00:00:13.450> 2d<00:00:13.780> drawing<00:00:14.160> from<00:00:15.160> there

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
CAD and produced a 2d drawing from there

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.350 
CAD and produced a 2d drawing from there
I've<00:00:15.549> actually<00:00:15.780> brought<00:00:16.780> it<00:00:16.900> into<00:00:17.050> CorelDraw

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
I've actually brought it into CorelDraw

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.760 
I've actually brought it into CorelDraw
you<00:00:19.360> can<00:00:19.539> see<00:00:19.750> it<00:00:19.840> here<00:00:20.020> and<00:00:20.200> I'm<00:00:20.500> just<00:00:20.530> about

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
you can see it here and I'm just about

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.670 
you can see it here and I'm just about
to<00:00:20.920> print<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.310> out<00:00:21.369> on<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:22.630> versa<00:00:22.840> laser<00:00:23.230> over

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
to print it out on the versa laser over

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:58.939 
to print it out on the versa laser over
here<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.300> let's<00:00:25.480> check<00:00:25.690> it<00:00:25.720> out

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.619 

here<00:00:59.949> we<00:01:00.070> have<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.370> finished<00:01:00.550> product<00:01:00.910> it's

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
here we have the finished product it's

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.660 
here we have the finished product it's
turned<00:01:01.870> out<00:01:01.960> pretty<00:01:02.199> well<00:01:02.260> I'm<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:03.309> happy<00:01:03.340> with

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
turned out pretty well I'm so happy with

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.340 
turned out pretty well I'm so happy with
it<00:01:03.730> that<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.059> actually<00:01:04.239> made<00:01:04.540> a<00:01:04.570> second<00:01:04.960> one<00:01:04.989> and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
it that I actually made a second one and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.980 
it that I actually made a second one and
made<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.190> one<00:01:06.400> out<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.640> Kermit<00:01:07.210> green<00:01:07.690> but

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
made this one out of Kermit green but

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.600 
made this one out of Kermit green but
we'll<00:01:08.500> see<00:01:08.680> which<00:01:08.830> one<00:01:09.009> I'll<00:01:09.130> go<00:01:09.250> with<00:01:09.460> yet

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
we'll see which one I'll go with yet

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.550 
we'll see which one I'll go with yet
I've<00:01:09.729> made<00:01:09.970> my<00:01:10.119> mind<00:01:10.299> up<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:13.780> just<00:01:14.320> about<00:01:14.500> to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
I've made my mind up I'm just about to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.160 
I've made my mind up I'm just about to
use<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.920> mdx<00:01:15.280> 40<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.850> make<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.060> sign<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.990> go<00:01:17.110> on

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
use the mdx 40 to make a sign to go on

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.290 
use the mdx 40 to make a sign to go on
the<00:01:17.259> front<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.500> my<00:01:17.590> milling<00:01:17.920> cupboard<00:01:18.300> let's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300

everything<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> panel<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.350> I'm<00:02:26.980> just

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
everything to the panel and I'm just

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.890 
everything to the panel and I'm just
cutting<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.790> into<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.270> side<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.510> my<00:02:28.630> milling

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
cutting it into the side of my milling

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.590 
cutting it into the side of my milling
machine<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.380> now<00:02:30.060> that's<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.150> little<00:02:31.300> bit<00:02:31.420> too

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
machine just now that's a little bit too

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.450 
machine just now that's a little bit too
whole<00:02:31.840> too<00:02:32.320> hard<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.740> hold<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.070> camera<00:02:33.400> and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
whole too hard to hold the camera and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.120 
whole too hard to hold the camera and
shoot<00:02:33.760> at<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.910> same<00:02:34.150> time<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.830> what<00:02:35.830> I've<00:02:35.980> done

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
shoot at the same time so what I've done

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.650 
shoot at the same time so what I've done
is<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.400> use<00:02:36.550> an<00:02:36.730> angle<00:02:36.970> grinder<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> drill

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
is just use an angle grinder and a drill

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.740 
is just use an angle grinder and a drill
and<00:02:37.870> cut<00:02:38.740> my<00:02:38.920> way<00:02:39.070> through<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.480> we're<00:02:40.600> nearly

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
and cut my way through and we're nearly

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.110 
and cut my way through and we're nearly
there

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.990 

we<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:47.220> well<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.430> all<00:02:48.640> back<00:02:48.820> together

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
we have it well it's all back together

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.690 
we have it well it's all back together
I've<00:02:49.959> got<00:02:50.110> all<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.320> electronics<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.550> all

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
I've got all the electronics in it's all

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.699 
I've got all the electronics in it's all
working<00:02:52.150> I've<00:02:52.270> tested<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.959> thought<00:02:53.500> I'd<00:02:53.590> do

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
working I've tested it I thought I'd do

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.890 
working I've tested it I thought I'd do
this<00:02:53.860> last<00:02:54.459> video<00:02:54.760> which<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.180> part<00:02:55.360> four<00:02:55.690> now

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this last video which is part four now

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.740 
this last video which is part four now
to<00:02:55.959> complete<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:57.030> as<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.240> see<00:02:58.420> I've<00:02:58.540> done

to complete it as you can see I've done

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.090 
to complete it as you can see I've done
all<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.110> wiring<00:02:59.350> I've<00:02:59.560> tried<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.890> do<00:02:59.980> it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
all the wiring I've tried to do it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.490 
all the wiring I've tried to do it
fairly<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.550> heat<00:03:00.670> excuse<00:03:00.970> my<00:03:01.150> camera<00:03:01.540> jumping

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
fairly and heat excuse my camera jumping

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.830 
fairly and heat excuse my camera jumping
all<00:03:02.620> around<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.010> place<00:03:03.510> as<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:04.810> I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
all around the place as you know I

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.260 
all around the place as you know I
predominately<00:03:05.560> film<00:03:05.860> with<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.310> iPhone<00:03:06.940> so

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
predominately film with the iPhone so

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.790 
predominately film with the iPhone so
it's<00:03:07.420> not<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.690> best<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.170> look<00:03:08.350> it's<00:03:08.680> all

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
it's not the best but look it's all

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.790 
it's not the best but look it's all
