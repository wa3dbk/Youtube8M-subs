00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.320
 Konbanha 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
 Experts who draw out the potential and strength of 21 years 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.679
 Athlete provider's discord is courage 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.730
 I would like to talk about the habits of top players 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.499
 I think 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.229
 To be a professional player 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.920
 Daily training and 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.820
 You will be asked for the result in the game 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 As a top player 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.380
 In training or a game 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.250
 Small awareness and feeling 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.050
 I cherish 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.710
 I would like to introduce 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.910
 About Shunsuke Nakamura, a famous soccer player 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.030
 I write daily the back of football since high school days 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.410
 It is 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.160
 It's about soccer 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.250
 For example, before the game 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.160
 Continue to spend time with the game 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.430
 After the game 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.140
 By looking back on the theme 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 It is to write monthly 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 Nakamura commented Arita city about a soccer boat 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.320
 Because I left it 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.520
 In each work 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.790
 Let's feel and think 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.790
 Can be organized objectively 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.660
 Because my past performance has come to pass 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.070
 There is a new discovery when looking back 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.100
 I left a comment 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.230
 in this way 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.670
 About 19 cm 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.200
 Not only the goal 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.870
 What I felt or noticed 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
 It is a habit of making notes 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.520
 By the way, about the effectiveness of this memorandum 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.450
 I wrote it on my blog 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.820
 Even with people who do 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.490
 Izumo city first place 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.110
 As time passes, a big difference can be born 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 Also proven at Harvard University 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.189
 I used the goal achievement 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.189
 How about making something to drop in front of you 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 Let's all be scared again 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.379
 Matsuo Sato 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.030
 We sent by offer of Takikawa-shi
