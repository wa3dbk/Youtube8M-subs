00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.180
 hello everyone welcome on my channel 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.730
 today little video so on 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.540
 the emulator super nintendo and snes to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.220
 more on ipad so the software gets 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.310
 present like that so you have it in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.990
 portrait mode at launch 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.020
 so you have the menu and all that 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.040
 is backup everything that is 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.410
 orientations are a small system a 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 little success system a bit like on 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.250
 xbox with completions and all that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.719
 you could do on the different 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 games you have in your library 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.769
 here is the application against 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.670
 is not free of some bugs by 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:01.129
 moment here as we can see here 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.510
 she reboots all by herself so we restart her 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.540
 not very bad either here again 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.190
 bug 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.800
 that's all to show you this in 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.810
 ultimately so you have you have 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.040
 a link with the possibility therefore to go 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.450
 on three sites you can go well 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.549
 sure type your addresses if you have your 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.549
 sites to you for recovering roms 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.170
 of course the Roma you go 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.329
 recover must have the original 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.290
 if not, then it is the apology of 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.100
 illegal download so here is the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.869
 precision is done 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.970
 so here you have to surf 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.040
 you look at the first letter of 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.840
 your game click on it and then you 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.460
 surely there are very large 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.689
 chances that you find the game too 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.700
 although this is the Japanese version 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.270
 French American there is no 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.850
 problem 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.570
 so here after the site number 2 fast 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 Rome to not name it the same you are 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.060
 many numerous games and the third 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.079
 I like a little less 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.320
 that's where you go too 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.460
 found a lot of corner games so but 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.460
 of course you have to have the original 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:19.609
 now we will launch a f0 game so 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.439
 and 0 the oldest know 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.689
 younger a little less so that's a 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.400
 game that came out in 1992 on super 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.799
 nintendo at the time it was still 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 really a game that marked me finally 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.939
 I know that at the time it had marked the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.510
 youth and 0 of a the same temper that 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:38.139
 street fighter or or wipeout for to 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.650
 the time on playstation what so voila 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:43.939
 you drive a small ship I 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.129
 not make you the presentation of the game a 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.019
 everyone knows and 0 that's it 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.199
 turns relatively well if there is no 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.189
 jerks it's fluid and elegant on 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:56.569
 can see it there is no problem so 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:02.689
 it's really nice to be redone 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:05.060
 small parts of 2 0 so everything 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.760
 who's command you have exactly 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.949
 all the same buttons as on a super 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.449
 nintendo classic then there is a game 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.419
 who really has a little faster you 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:20.319
 have a pinball game you have 4 4 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:22.849
 plateaux so pinball dreams of 1993 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.220
 so it's a little older necessarily 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.069
 seen from above like that plus the pinball machine 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.840
 with the dynamic camera 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.560
 well, but it's always nice 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.000
 to say play what you see but I 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.449
 found to be relatively hard for 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.060
 the time 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.819
 it is true that we did not make 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.129
 the kid's pinball machines at the time and of course 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:48.620
 now super mario world super mario 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:50.220
 world 1992 released in Japan 1990 so there 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.530
 we no longer present 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.210
 we do not present so Mario anymore 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.580
 great game so it's really fun 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.280
 to find that on his i no ipad min 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.920
 you can also do that on 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.460
 iphone so I specify of course that 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.600
 your ipad must be jailbroken 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:13.110
 to be able to install the software and 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.019
 snes has more to more by good so I 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.079
 will put the cydia link on the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.090
 comments from youtube so and like that 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.130
 you will be able to play all your 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.380
 favorite games here I hope this 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.760
 video you liked if you have any 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.300

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.310
