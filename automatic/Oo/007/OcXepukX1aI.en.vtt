noticed with this ROM there are some
system<00:05:45.750> UI<00:05:45.990> maybe<00:05:46.860> you'll<00:05:47.100> crash<00:05:47.400> once<00:05:48.330> every

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
system UI maybe you'll crash once every

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.600 
system UI maybe you'll crash once every
week<00:05:49.110> or<00:05:49.350> something<00:05:49.800> I've<00:05:50.070> had<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.370> crashed

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
week or something I've had it crashed

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.020 
week or something I've had it crashed
two<00:05:50.850> times<00:05:51.120> in<00:05:51.480> like<00:05:51.690> six<00:05:52.560> days<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:53.190> it's<00:05:53.880> been

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
two times in like six days so it's been

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.470 
two times in like six days so it's been
pretty<00:05:54.060> good<00:05:54.419> for<00:05:54.630> me<00:05:55.880> after<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.150> it's

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
pretty good for me after that it's

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.790 
pretty good for me after that it's
pretty<00:05:57.570> much<00:05:58.140> it's<00:05:58.560> um<00:05:58.890> you<00:05:59.930> have<00:06:00.930> to<00:06:00.960> add<00:06:01.500> your

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
pretty much it's um you have to add your

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.640 
pretty much it's um you have to add your
own<00:06:01.860> APN<00:06:02.550> I<00:06:02.880> think<00:06:03.510> because<00:06:04.200> I've<00:06:04.440> been

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
own APN I think because I've been

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.320 
own APN I think because I've been
getting<00:06:04.830> three<00:06:05.250> gene<00:06:05.550> which<00:06:05.970> has<00:06:06.000> been<00:06:06.300> a

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
getting three gene which has been a

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.830 
getting three gene which has been a
problem<00:06:07.010> but<00:06:08.010> if<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:08.760> add<00:06:08.910> your<00:06:09.090> own<00:06:09.120> APN

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
problem but if you add your own APN

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.220 
problem but if you add your own APN
LTE<00:06:10.169> should<00:06:10.710> work<00:06:11.190> and<00:06:11.480> basically<00:06:12.480> what<00:06:12.750> APN

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
LTE should work and basically what APN

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.550 
LTE should work and basically what APN
is<00:06:13.500> is<00:06:14.060> just<00:06:15.060> search<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.450> up<00:06:15.540> on<00:06:15.750> Google<00:06:16.140> it's

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
is is just search it up on Google it's

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.040 
is is just search it up on Google it's
really<00:06:16.860> easy<00:06:17.040> to<00:06:17.190> find<00:06:17.450> as<00:06:18.450> you<00:06:18.510> can<00:06:18.720> see<00:06:18.900> we're

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
really easy to find as you can see we're

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.460 
really easy to find as you can see we're
going<00:06:19.169> through<00:06:19.530> this<00:06:19.710> right<00:06:19.950> now<00:06:21.230> sorry<00:06:22.230> it's

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
going through this right now sorry it's

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.350 
going through this right now sorry it's
taking<00:06:23.010> so<00:06:23.220> long<00:06:23.250> but<00:06:23.700> can't<00:06:24.000> do<00:06:24.120> anything

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
taking so long but can't do anything

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.770 
taking so long but can't do anything
about<00:06:24.570> that<00:06:26.600> almost<00:06:27.600> done<00:06:27.840> here<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:30.210> it'll<00:06:30.720> be

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
about that almost done here so it'll be

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.480 
about that almost done here so it'll be
different<00:06:31.440> if<00:06:31.590> you<00:06:31.740> have<00:06:31.860> a<00:06:31.890> note<00:06:32.160> to<00:06:32.340> or

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
different if you have a note to or

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.960 
different if you have a note to or
anything<00:06:32.669> since<00:06:33.240> this<00:06:33.540> is<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:33.840> AT&amp;T<00:06:34.169> s3<00:06:34.970> all

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
anything since this is the AT&amp;T s3 all

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.330 
anything since this is the AT&amp;T s3 all
the<00:06:36.210> processors<00:06:36.780> are<00:06:36.930> different<00:06:37.350> so<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:37.919> just

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
the processors are different so I just

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.580 
the processors are different so I just
wanted<00:06:38.610> to<00:06:38.700> show<00:06:38.910> you<00:06:38.970> the<00:06:39.330> benchmark<00:06:39.810> usually

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
wanted to show you the benchmark usually

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.969 
wanted to show you the benchmark usually
on<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.770> Galaxy<00:06:41.100> s3<00:06:41.220> on<00:06:41.729> this<00:06:42.030> one<00:06:42.270> I<00:06:42.479> get<00:06:42.979> 4600

on the Galaxy s3 on this one I get 4600

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.450 
on the Galaxy s3 on this one I get 4600
on<00:06:44.100> stock<00:06:44.660> let's<00:06:45.660> check<00:06:45.900> out<00:06:46.080> what<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.410> is<00:06:46.440> here

yeah around the same area 4,500 you can

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.610 
yeah around the same area 4,500 you can
always<00:06:52.180> install<00:06:52.450> a<00:06:52.570> different<00:06:52.840> kernel<00:06:53.410> for

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
always install a different kernel for

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.570 
always install a different kernel for
your<00:06:53.830> device<00:06:54.780> as<00:06:55.800> I<00:06:56.800> said<00:06:57.040> before<00:06:57.190> this

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
your device as I said before this

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.830 
your device as I said before this
doesn't<00:06:58.030> really<00:06:58.180> matter

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
doesn't really matter

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.640 
doesn't really matter
zoom<00:06:59.680> it<00:06:59.830> a<00:06:59.890> little<00:07:00.070> more<00:07:00.310> for<00:07:00.550> you<00:07:00.640> to<00:07:00.850> see<00:07:01.650> but

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
zoom it a little more for you to see but

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.360 
zoom it a little more for you to see but
it<00:07:02.860> does<00:07:03.040> not<00:07:03.220> mean<00:07:03.550> everything<00:07:04.060> so<00:07:05.190> I'm<00:07:06.190> also

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
it does not mean everything so I'm also

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.890 
it does not mean everything so I'm also
going<00:07:06.490> to<00:07:06.640> be<00:07:06.760> doing<00:07:07.000> this<00:07:07.120> new<00:07:07.360> part<00:07:07.660> where<00:07:07.870> I

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
going to be doing this new part where I

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.640 
going to be doing this new part where I
read<00:07:08.350> it<00:07:08.500> out<00:07:08.650> of<00:07:08.860> 10<00:07:09.100> stars<00:07:09.400> and<00:07:09.910> I<00:07:10.720> had<00:07:11.380> to

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
read it out of 10 stars and I had to

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.890 
read it out of 10 stars and I had to
give<00:07:11.860> this<00:07:12.100> ROM<00:07:12.780> 9<00:07:13.780> out<00:07:14.020> of<00:07:14.050> 10<00:07:14.440> so<00:07:15.600> why<00:07:16.600> 9

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
give this ROM 9 out of 10 so why 9

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.170 
give this ROM 9 out of 10 so why 9
because<00:07:17.470> it<00:07:17.650> has<00:07:17.800> so<00:07:18.100> many<00:07:18.250> features<00:07:18.580> you<00:07:19.030> get

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
because it has so many features you get

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.350 
because it has so many features you get
TouchWiz<00:07:20.040> 4.2.2<00:07:21.040> everything<00:07:21.610> you<00:07:21.760> want<00:07:22.060> in<00:07:22.270> a

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
ROM and I find that just awesome also

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.820 
ROM and I find that just awesome also

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
why didn't give it 10 out of 10 was just

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.250 
why didn't give it 10 out of 10 was just
the<00:07:29.980> reason<00:07:30.310> that<00:07:30.730> you<00:07:31.000> have<00:07:31.150> to<00:07:31.180> put<00:07:31.540> your<00:07:31.690> APN
