trick<00:00:37.060> to<00:00:37.090> executing<00:00:37.840> this<00:00:37.989> cleanly<00:00:38.440> and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
trick to executing this cleanly and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.920 
trick to executing this cleanly and
accurately<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:40.000> at<00:00:40.510> tempo<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:42.570> high<00:00:43.570> speed

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
accurately and at tempo and high speed

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.680 
accurately and at tempo and high speed
is<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:45.010> use<00:00:45.129> economy<00:00:45.609> picking<00:00:45.850> which<00:00:46.449> is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
is to use economy picking which is

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
is to use economy picking which is
basically<00:00:47.199> a<00:00:47.500> down<00:00:47.980> up<00:00:48.280> down<00:00:48.519> down<00:00:49.120> up<00:00:49.510> down

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.080 

so<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:59.800> I'm<00:00:59.920> descending<00:01:00.489> it<00:01:00.730> basically

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
so when I'm descending it basically

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.560 
so when I'm descending it basically
morphs<00:01:01.480> into<00:01:01.600> this<00:01:01.960> quazy<00:01:02.830> a<00:01:03.520> harmonic<00:01:04.420> minor

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
morphs into this quazy a harmonic minor

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:14.880 
morphs into this quazy a harmonic minor
type<00:01:04.960> run<00:01:05.800> where<00:01:06.040> I<00:01:06.070> add<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.700> G<00:01:07.450> sharp<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
type run where I add the G sharp so

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.219 
type run where I add the G sharp so
leaves<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.729> right<00:01:15.940> leading<00:01:16.630> tone<00:01:16.810> ready<00:01:17.080> to

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
leaves you right leading tone ready to

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
leaves you right leading tone ready to
come<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.560> on<00:01:17.710> one<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.740> very<00:01:20.950> slowly

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
come in on one take this very slowly

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.300 
come in on one take this very slowly
practice<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.020> economy<00:01:23.530> picking<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:24.070> get<00:01:24.220> it

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
practice the economy picking to get it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.730 
practice the economy picking to get it
clean<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:24.580> accurate<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:26.110> subdivision

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
clean and accurate and the subdivision

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.340 
clean and accurate and the subdivision
right<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.160> don't<00:01:27.280> want<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.790> be<00:01:27.940> like<00:01:31.350> ask

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
right you don't want it to be like ask

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.050 
right you don't want it to be like ask
if<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.710> want<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.070> be<00:01:33.100> exactly<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.970> way

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
if you want it to be exactly and the way

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.010 
if you want it to be exactly and the way
to<00:01:37.119> do<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.780> practice<00:01:38.590> slowly<00:01:39.160> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
to do that is practice slowly and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.499 
to do that is practice slowly and
practice<00:01:41.020> accurately<00:01:41.970> speed<00:01:42.970> will<00:01:43.149> come<00:01:43.330> by

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
practice accurately speed will come by

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.040 
practice accurately speed will come by
itself<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.700> found<00:01:45.940> personally<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
itself and I found personally that the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.740 
itself and I found personally that the
more<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.440> chased<00:01:47.860> speed<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:49.360> more<00:01:49.570> that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
more that I chased speed the more that

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.529 
more that I chased speed the more that
it<00:01:49.930> with<00:01:50.649> distance<00:01:51.100> itself<00:01:51.460> from<00:01:51.580> me<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.360> more

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
it with distance itself from me the more

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.090 
it with distance itself from me the more
I<00:01:52.570> was<00:01:52.810> like<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.259> whatever<00:01:53.619> i'm<00:01:53.830> just<00:01:53.979> going

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
I was like that whatever i'm just going

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.100 
I was like that whatever i'm just going
to<00:01:54.130> pay<00:01:54.280> more<00:01:54.460> attention<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.910> accuracy<00:01:55.810> and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
to pay more attention to accuracy and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.310 
to pay more attention to accuracy and
quality<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:57.160> notes<00:01:57.460> instead<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.970> quantity

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
quality of notes instead of quantity

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.870 
quality of notes instead of quantity
when<00:01:59.320> i<00:01:59.350> started<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.890> do<00:02:00.039> that<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.490> i<00:02:00.580> started

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
when i started to do that and i started

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.120 
when i started to do that and i started
to<00:02:01.000> practice<00:02:01.179> really<00:02:01.569> slow<00:02:01.929> i<00:02:02.200> started<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.979> go

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
to practice really slow i started to go

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.600 
to practice really slow i started to go
through<00:02:03.369> stuff<00:02:03.550> like<00:02:03.670> this

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.010 

and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.790> paying<00:02:09.030> attention<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.930> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and I was paying attention to was I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.860 
and I was paying attention to was I
wasting<00:02:10.229> motion<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.760> always<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.270> place<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.690> at

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
wasting motion as I always a place in at

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.170 
wasting motion as I always a place in at
taking<00:02:13.320> or<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:16.130> when<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.220> was<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> concise<00:02:17.880> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
taking or was I when I was a concise and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.870 
taking or was I when I was a concise and
precise<00:02:19.100> when<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.160> started<00:02:20.520> paying<00:02:20.730> attention

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
precise when I started paying attention

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.830 
precise when I started paying attention
to<00:02:21.390> quality<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.990> notes<00:02:22.230> over<00:02:22.590> quantity<00:02:23.840> speed

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
to quality of notes over quantity speed

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.040 
to quality of notes over quantity speed
just<00:02:25.820> like<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.330> couldn't<00:02:27.600> get<00:02:27.720> rid<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
just like I that couldn't get rid of it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.400 
just like I that couldn't get rid of it
so<00:02:28.620> always<00:02:29.520> practice<00:02:30.150> slowly<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> accurately

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
so always practice slowly and accurately

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.980 
so always practice slowly and accurately
