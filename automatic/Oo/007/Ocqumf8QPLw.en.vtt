00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and make it happen on defense so as you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.390

guys<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:31.020> actually<00:02:31.050> uh<00:02:31.530> I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
guys see here that was actually uh I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.220 
guys see here that was actually uh I
believe<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.270> pass<00:02:33.960> interference

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
believe it was like a pass interference

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.340 
believe it was like a pass interference
car<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.220> don't<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.460> what<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> was<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:36.350> we

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
car I don't know what that was but we

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.600 
car I don't know what that was but we
could<00:02:37.530> manage<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.920> get<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> ball<00:02:38.340> back

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
could manage to get the ball back

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.200 
could manage to get the ball back
anyways<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.290> guys<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.590> see<00:02:40.650> here

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
anyways and as you guys can see here

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.670 
anyways and as you guys can see here
actually<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.300> think<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.020> lady<00:02:43.350> hate

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.130 
actually I think it was like a lady hate
or<00:02:43.890> something<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.610> actually<00:02:45.420> don't<00:02:45.750> know<00:02:45.960> what

or something I actually don't know what
it<00:02:46.260> was<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.500> might<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.460> pass<00:02:47.790> interference<00:02:48.060> but

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it was I might be pass interference but

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000 
it was I might be pass interference but
we<00:02:48.630> got<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> ball<00:02:49.050> back<00:02:49.080> here<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.770> time<00:02:49.890> we

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
streak the tight end right here we

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.040 
streak the tight end right here we
almost<00:05:07.980> had<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> touchdown<00:05:08.790> so<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.000> see<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:09.690> the

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
almost had a touchdown so I see that the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.870 
almost had a touchdown so I see that the
title<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.440> kind<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.890> open<00:05:11.130> down<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.520> middle<00:05:11.790> of

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
title is kind of open down the middle of

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.700 
title is kind of open down the middle of
the<00:05:11.940> field<00:05:12.120> this<00:05:12.900> time<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.200> come<00:05:13.380> on<00:05:13.500> in<00:05:13.650> the

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
the field this time I come on in the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.050 
the field this time I come on in the
different<00:05:14.070> formation<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.700> actually

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
different formation this is actually

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.320 
different formation this is actually
though<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.420> believe<00:05:15.990> tight<00:05:16.260> slots<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.210> look<00:05:18.210> at

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
though I believe tight slots and look at

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.000 
though I believe tight slots and look at
