00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
bit extreme in some cases but for me

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040 
bit extreme in some cases but for me
this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.850> low-key<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.809> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
this is a little low-key it's not so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
this is a little low-key it's not so
extreme<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> eyebrow<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
extreme so here is the eyebrow on this

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.220 
extreme so here is the eyebrow on this
side<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:56.239> then<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> looks<00:00:58.079> like

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
side and then this is what it looks like

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
side and then this is what it looks like
before<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.940> my

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
before so this here is actually my

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
before so this here is actually my
eyebrows<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.620> pretty<00:01:01.859> thick<00:01:02.190> eyebrows

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
eyebrows I have pretty thick eyebrows

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
eyebrows I have pretty thick eyebrows
the<00:01:03.000> lighting<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.899> great<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.140> hope<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the lighting is not so great I hope that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.510 
the lighting is not so great I hope that
it<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.189> should<00:01:05.519> brighten<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.520> reload

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it it should brighten up when I reload

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.510 
it it should brighten up when I reload
it<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> red<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.130> then

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it so but you can see the red and then

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
it so but you can see the red and then
plane<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.869> side<00:01:16.170> tends<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> little

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
plane so this side tends to be a little

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020 
plane so this side tends to be a little
bit<00:01:17.549> thinner<00:01:17.909> than<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.780> side<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:20.100> tend<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
bit thinner than this side and I tend to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.980 
bit thinner than this side and I tend to
raise<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.540> eyebrow<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.259> lot<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.900> have

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
raise this eyebrow a lot more and I have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
raise this eyebrow a lot more and I have
more<00:01:25.259> control<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> armor-all<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.820> than

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
more control of this armor-all more than

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.020 
more control of this armor-all more than
the<00:01:27.119> other<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> try<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.579> them<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.970> close

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the other so I try to get them as close

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.160 
the other so I try to get them as close
as<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.710> thickness<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.900> do<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> best

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
as I can in thickness and do the best

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.370 
as I can in thickness and do the best
that<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:35.210> be<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.780> begin<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that I can to be to begin I'm going to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.789 
that I can to be to begin I'm going to
be<00:01:37.439> using<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:39.540> old<00:01:39.720> cope<00:01:40.110> Coastal<00:01:40.770> Scents

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
be using the the old cope Coastal Scents

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.550 
be using the the old cope Coastal Scents
palette<00:01:41.369> you've<00:01:42.240> seen<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.990> many<00:01:43.049> times

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
palette you've seen this so many times

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
palette you've seen this so many times
this<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.130> think<00:01:44.579> probably<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> ever<00:01:45.329> owned

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this I think probably if you ever owned

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630 
this I think probably if you ever owned
this<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:46.350> than<00:01:46.470> likely<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.250> lid<00:01:47.430> has

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this more than likely the lid has

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
this more than likely the lid has
already<00:01:47.880> broken<00:01:48.030> off<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> mirror<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
already broken off with the mirror and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
already broken off with the mirror and
all<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.159> we're<00:01:50.280> gonna<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.549> using<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
all that but we're gonna be using this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.539 
all that but we're gonna be using this
red<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> color<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
red down here that's the color that I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370 
red down here that's the color that I
use<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> majority<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
use it's the majority of what it is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
use it's the majority of what it is
and<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.640> taking<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.210> Mac<00:01:57.659> brush

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and I'm going to be taking a Mac brush

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920 
and I'm going to be taking a Mac brush
this<00:01:58.409> might<00:01:58.619> brush<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> Mac<00:01:59.850> 212<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
this might brush is a Mac 212 and this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
this might brush is a Mac 212 and this
is<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> smaller<00:02:01.649> ones<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
is one of the smaller ones it's just I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.889 
is one of the smaller ones it's just I
just<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> smaller<00:02:03.420> ones<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.869> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
just like the smaller ones because you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
just like the smaller ones because you
can<00:02:04.049> always<00:02:04.170> throw<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.340> my<00:02:05.520> purse<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
can always throw it in a in my purse and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.609 
can always throw it in a in my purse and
I<00:02:06.270> feel<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.750> less<00:02:07.020> likely<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> get

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I feel like it's less likely to get

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.859 
I feel like it's less likely to get
broken<00:02:07.920> because<00:02:08.300> I've<00:02:09.300> definitely<00:02:09.479> had<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> few

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
broken because I've definitely had a few

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.800 
broken because I've definitely had a few
brushes<00:02:10.379> get<00:02:10.679> broke<00:02:10.860> before<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.670> hate<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
brushes get broke before and I hate that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.780 
brushes get broke before and I hate that
and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.080> later<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.709> we'll<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.040> using<00:02:14.340> my<00:02:14.610> new
