easier for us to stick our stripes on a
nice<00:00:23.000> even<00:00:23.390> surface<00:00:23.599> and<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.800> purpose<00:00:25.099> of

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
nice even surface and the purpose of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.589 
nice even surface and the purpose of
video<00:00:25.400> I've<00:00:25.519> just<00:00:25.670> used<00:00:25.849> a<00:00:25.939> fake<00:00:26.119> one<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:26.359> I<00:00:26.480> can

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
video I've just used a fake one so I can

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.179 
video I've just used a fake one so I can
pick<00:00:26.779> it<00:00:26.810> up<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.140> move<00:00:27.259> it<00:00:27.349> around<00:00:27.470> easily<00:00:27.769> but

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
pick it up and move it around easily but

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.519 
pick it up and move it around easily but
obviously<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:29.390> would<00:00:29.539> do<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.779> on<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:29.960> real<00:00:30.170> one

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
obviously you would do it on a real one

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.320 
obviously you would do it on a real one
so<00:00:31.039> I'm<00:00:31.250> just<00:00:31.400> going<00:00:31.519> to<00:00:31.580> move<00:00:31.699> that<00:00:31.759> to<00:00:32.180> one

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
so I'm just going to move that to one

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.780 
so I'm just going to move that to one
side<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:32.839> I'm<00:00:33.769> going<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.040> use<00:00:34.190> two<00:00:34.400> different

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
side so I'm going to use two different

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.850 
side so I'm going to use two different
shades<00:00:35.030> of<00:00:35.269> green<00:00:35.480> sorry<00:00:36.290> I<00:00:36.379> think<00:00:36.470> we<00:00:36.680> come

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
shades of green sorry I think we come

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.210 
shades of green sorry I think we come
with<00:00:37.040> losing<00:00:37.430> focus<00:00:37.720> em<00:00:38.720> so<00:00:39.500> down<00:00:39.680> corner<00:00:40.040> and

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
with losing focus em so down corner and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.250 
with losing focus em so down corner and
a<00:00:40.309> more<00:00:40.640> yellowy<00:00:40.940> colored<00:00:41.330> one<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.019> we'll<00:00:42.110> just

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
a more yellowy colored one so we'll just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.130 
a more yellowy colored one so we'll just
do<00:00:42.409> them<00:00:42.559> one<00:00:42.830> at<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.979> time<00:00:43.190> start<00:00:43.670> with<00:00:44.140> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
do them one at a time start with and

we're just gonna roll it out then it's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.030 
we're just gonna roll it out then it's
just<00:00:50.960> normal<00:00:51.290> fondant<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.040> I've<00:00:52.220> dyed<00:00:54.040> if

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
just normal fondant that I've dyed if

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.189

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
like mine you've got some lumps and it

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.369 
like mine you've got some lumps and it
just<00:00:57.470> go<00:00:57.710> over<00:00:57.949> it<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.070> smoother<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.780> smooth

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
just go over it the smoother so smooth

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.700 
just go over it the smoother so smooth
it<00:01:00.559> down<00:01:00.589> a<00:01:00.769> little<00:01:01.010> bit<00:01:04.930> could<00:01:05.930> be<00:01:06.110> smoother

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
it down a little bit could be smoother

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.260 
it down a little bit could be smoother
so<00:01:06.979> if<00:01:07.189> you've<00:01:07.310> got<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> bit<00:01:07.580> more<00:01:07.610> time<00:01:07.939> than<00:01:08.150> me

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
connect it to that invitation I've made

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.109 
connect it to that invitation I've made
I<00:02:05.170> am<00:02:06.170> sorry<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> camera<00:02:07.159> keeps<00:02:07.549> losing<00:02:07.819> focus

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
I am sorry the camera keeps losing focus

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.460 
I am sorry the camera keeps losing focus
I<00:02:08.450> don't<00:02:08.600> know<00:02:08.720> why

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.860 

hopefully<00:02:12.470> what<00:02:12.650> keep<00:02:12.829> doing<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.129> okay<00:02:13.939> so<00:02:14.750> now

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
hopefully what keep doing it okay so now

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.020 
hopefully what keep doing it okay so now
I've<00:02:15.019> got<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.470> straight<00:02:15.860> edge<00:02:16.010> from<00:02:16.849> that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
I've got a straight edge from that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.850 
I've got a straight edge from that
straight<00:02:17.329> edge<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.170> go<00:02:18.290> across<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.799> we

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
straight edge we can go across and we

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.119 
straight edge we can go across and we
can<00:02:19.010> mark<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:22.040> top<00:02:22.069> across<00:02:22.730> our<00:02:22.939> inches<00:02:24.129> so

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
can mark in the top across our inches so

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.130 
can mark in the top across our inches so
these<00:02:25.250> should<00:02:25.549> then<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.790> parallel<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.689> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
these should then be parallel to the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.929 
these should then be parallel to the
marks<00:02:27.470> we've<00:02:27.680> met<00:02:27.859> at<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.040> bottom<00:02:30.519> now<00:02:31.519> start

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
marks we've met at the bottom now start

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:40.720 
marks we've met at the bottom now start
cutting<00:02:33.939> across<00:02:34.939> each<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.450> them<00:02:39.519> can<00:02:40.519> use<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
cutting across each of them can use a

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.750 
cutting across each of them can use a
pizza<00:02:41.030> cutter<00:02:41.390> find<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.109> easier<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:49.579> once

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
pizza cutter find that easier so once

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.789 
pizza cutter find that easier so once
you've<00:02:49.909> cut<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.209> up<00:02:50.389> you<00:02:50.989> do<00:02:51.200> exactly<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.769> same

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
you've cut it up you do exactly the same

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.920 
you've cut it up you do exactly the same
with<00:02:52.190> your<00:02:52.340> with<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.549> color<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:53.000> minutes<00:02:53.450> so

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
with your with a color for minutes so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.210 
with your with a color for minutes so
I'll<00:02:54.170> move<00:02:54.349> these<00:02:54.560> out<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.859> way<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.129> be

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
I'll move these out the way just be

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.920 
I'll move these out the way just be
careful<00:02:55.579> when<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.790> pick<00:02:55.970> them<00:02:56.120> up<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.840> you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
careful when you pick them up that you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:06.350 
careful when you pick them up that you
don't<00:02:57.139> stretch<00:02:57.409> them<00:02:57.620> out<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.829> shape

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360

and then I'll tend to go back to the
other<00:05:04.680> side<00:05:15.020> then<00:05:16.020> we're<00:05:16.139> gonna<00:05:16.259> do<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:16.620> all

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
it's like when you get to the end but

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.950
