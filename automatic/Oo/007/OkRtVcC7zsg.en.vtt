automatic<00:00:05.879> chicken<00:00:06.240> farmer<00:00:06.710> this<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:08.130> going

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
automatic chicken farmer this is going

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.860 
automatic chicken farmer this is going
to<00:00:08.730> farm<00:00:09.210> chickens<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.050> give<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:11.870> already

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
to farm chickens and give you already

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.640 
to farm chickens and give you already
cooked<00:00:14.150> chicken<00:00:15.150> meat<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.410> should<00:00:16.619> be

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
cooked chicken meat so it should be

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.529 
cooked chicken meat so it should be
pretty<00:00:16.920> pretty<00:00:17.760> helpful<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> survival<00:00:18.779> mode

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
pretty pretty helpful and survival mode

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.269 
pretty pretty helpful and survival mode
and<00:00:19.810> it's<00:00:20.339> cool<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:23.289> is<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.890> doesn't<00:00:24.189> look

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
and it's cool this is it doesn't look

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.550 
and it's cool this is it doesn't look
very<00:00:24.310> consumable<00:00:25.269> right<00:00:25.480> now<00:00:25.660> but<00:00:25.989> really

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
very consumable right now but really

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.529 
very consumable right now but really
it's<00:00:26.890> very<00:00:27.189> conceivably<00:00:27.730> you<00:00:27.820> can<00:00:28.000> go<00:00:28.149> under

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
it's very conceivably you can go under

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.749 
it's very conceivably you can go under
like<00:00:28.869> three<00:00:29.109> blocks<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.800> cover<00:00:30.519> the<00:00:30.640> whole

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
like three blocks and cover the whole

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.329 
like three blocks and cover the whole
thing<00:00:30.789> up<00:00:31.090> whenever<00:00:32.050> whenever<00:00:32.920> you're<00:00:33.219> done

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:33.339 
thing up whenever whenever you're done

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:36.060 
thing up whenever whenever you're done
with<00:00:33.519> it<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:35.440> just<00:00:35.680> if<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.920> don't

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
with it and that's just if you don't

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.950 
with it and that's just if you don't
want<00:00:36.220> it<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.430> look<00:00:36.550> like<00:00:36.610> this<00:00:36.970> because<00:00:37.390> I'm<00:00:37.780> on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
want it to look like this because I'm on

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.829 
want it to look like this because I'm on
flat<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.589> you<00:00:39.190> go<00:00:39.460> down<00:00:39.489> like<00:00:40.360> five<00:00:40.659> blocks

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
flat and you go down like five blocks

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.280 
flat and you go down like five blocks
and<00:00:41.199> you're<00:00:41.290> at<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.440> end<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:41.680> world<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:43.290> if

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
and you're at the end of the world so if

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.899 
and you're at the end of the world so if
you're<00:00:44.470> doing<00:00:44.649> this<00:00:44.739> since<00:00:44.949> probably<00:00:45.220> like<00:00:45.729> I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
you're doing this since probably like I

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.470 
you're doing this since probably like I
was<00:00:46.210> then<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:47.170> very<00:00:47.829> helpful

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
was then is very helpful

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.000 
was then is very helpful
so<00:00:50.190> we'll<00:00:51.190> start<00:00:51.489> off<00:00:51.579> here<00:00:51.820> by<00:00:52.710> China<00:00:53.710> how<00:00:53.950> it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
so we'll start off here by China how it

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.819 
so we'll start off here by China how it
works<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:56.020> funnel<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.500> chickens

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
works basically you funnel the chickens

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.220 
works basically you funnel the chickens
through<00:00:57.070> here<00:00:57.370> they<00:00:57.940> catch<00:00:58.180> on<00:00:58.329> fire<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
through here they catch on fire and the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.479 
through here they catch on fire and the
reason<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.530> have<00:00:59.620> these<00:00:59.739> Pistons<00:01:00.220> here<00:01:00.370> is

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
reason you have these Pistons here is

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.150 
reason you have these Pistons here is
because<00:01:00.670> they'll<00:01:01.510> just<00:01:01.840> sit<00:01:02.140> there<00:01:02.379> unless

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
because they'll just sit there unless

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.760 
because they'll just sit there unless
they<00:01:03.340> think<00:01:03.640> they<00:01:03.790> have<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:03.970> way<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.300> get<00:01:04.720> out<00:01:04.900> so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
they think they have a way to get out so

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.340 
they think they have a way to get out so
if<00:01:06.280> they<00:01:06.520> have<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.759> way<00:01:07.300> to<00:01:07.360> get<00:01:07.570> out<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:08.020> trick

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
if they have a way to get out you trick

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.680 
if they have a way to get out you trick
them<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.890> that's<00:01:09.850> what<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> Pistons<00:01:10.570> are

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
them and that's what the Pistons are

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.210 
them and that's what the Pistons are
doing<00:01:10.930> they<00:01:11.080> stand<00:01:11.380> on<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.500> Pistons<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.100> then

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
doing they stand on the Pistons and then

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.890 
doing they stand on the Pistons and then
they<00:01:12.340> get<00:01:12.460> scraped<00:01:12.670> off<00:01:12.910> into<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.390> water<00:01:13.540> and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
they get scraped off into the water and

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.370 
they get scraped off into the water and
burn<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.009> death<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:16.390> they<00:01:16.840> can't<00:01:17.080> burn<00:01:17.290> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
burn to death but they can't burn to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.540 
burn to death but they can't burn to
death<00:01:17.530> if<00:01:17.740> they're<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.100> water<00:01:18.340> so

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
death if they're in water so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.310 
death if they're in water so
this<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.540> demonstration<00:01:20.660> I'm<00:01:21.290> going

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
this is just a demonstration I'm going

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.570 
this is just a demonstration I'm going
to<00:01:21.500> take<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.740> water<00:01:21.920> away<00:01:22.100> when<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.460> actually

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
to take the water away when we actually

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.890 
to take the water away when we actually
do<00:01:22.910> it<00:01:24.310> how<00:01:25.310> these<00:01:25.520> things<00:01:25.550> work<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:26.390> it's

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
do it how these things work is it's

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.350 
do it how these things work is it's
their<00:01:27.290> clock<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.340> simple<00:01:28.670> redstone<00:01:29.150> clock

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
their clock it's a simple redstone clock

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.380 
their clock it's a simple redstone clock
and<00:01:29.830> it's<00:01:30.830> connected<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.670> three<00:01:31.970> sticky

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
and it's connected to three sticky

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.670 
and it's connected to three sticky
pistons<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.910> do<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.870> quick<00:01:36.200> little<00:01:36.350> view

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
pistons and so do a quick little view

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.060 
pistons and so do a quick little view
here<00:01:36.980> basically<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.640> get<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.910> make<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.090> 7<00:01:38.540> by<00:01:38.690> 8

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
here basically you get to make a 7 by 8

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.170 
here basically you get to make a 7 by 8
flat<00:01:40.070> area

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
flat area

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.130 
flat area
you<00:01:43.910> just<00:01:44.910> copy<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.190> best<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.550> can

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
you just copy this it's the best I can

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.770 
you just copy this it's the best I can
say<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.410> just<00:01:49.950> sit<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:50.400> for<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> second

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
say right now just sit here for a second

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.730 
say right now just sit here for a second
he<00:01:53.290> paused<00:01:53.590> video<00:01:54.100> keep<00:01:54.430> coming<00:01:54.760> back<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.970> it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
he paused video keep coming back to it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.480 
he paused video keep coming back to it
so<00:01:57.290> basically<00:01:58.290> after<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.430> both

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so basically after you do that on both

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060 
so basically after you do that on both
sides<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.720> on<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:01.170> side<00:02:01.229> like

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
sides or you can do it on one side like

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.719 
sides or you can do it on one side like
this<00:02:02.280> room<00:02:03.000> right<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:04.159> see<00:02:05.159> those<00:02:05.340> tend<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this room right here I see those tend to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.330 
this room right here I see those tend to
work<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.149> bit<00:02:06.299> better

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
work a little bit better

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
work a little bit better
basically<00:02:09.179> after<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.599> done<00:02:09.750> doing<00:02:09.929> all

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
basically after you're done doing all

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.830 
basically after you're done doing all
that<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.039> cover<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.580> over<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.060> want<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that you cover it up over you want you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.610 
that you cover it up over you want you
make<00:02:13.019> sure<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.319> dig<00:02:13.620> down

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
make sure you dig down

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.729 
make sure you dig down
let<00:02:15.980> me<00:02:16.069> explain<00:02:16.159> this<00:02:16.459> real<00:02:16.670> quick<00:02:16.849> these<00:02:17.090> are

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
let me explain this real quick these are

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.800 
let me explain this real quick these are
nether<00:02:18.739> rocks<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.909> Hell<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.510> have<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.690> go

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
nether rocks from Hell so you have to go

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.010 
nether rocks from Hell so you have to go
down<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:20.989> hell

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
down to hell

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.170 
down to hell
these<00:02:23.650> are<00:02:23.800> everywhere<00:02:24.190> down<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
these are everywhere down there so you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.760 
these are everywhere down there so you
just<00:02:25.330> get<00:02:25.540> those<00:02:25.690> two<00:02:26.020> seconds<00:02:26.440> come<00:02:26.590> right

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
just get those two seconds come right

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.520 
just get those two seconds come right
back<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.340> they<00:02:27.610> stay<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.090> fire<00:02:28.420> forever<00:02:28.720> even

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
back and they stay on fire forever even

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.930 
back and they stay on fire forever even
apparently<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.280> ring<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:32.790> basically<00:02:33.790> you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
apparently in the ring so basically you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.020 
apparently in the ring so basically you
just<00:02:34.000> release<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> chickens<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
just release the chickens and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.199 
just release the chickens and
free<00:02:36.810> meat<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:38.520> don't<00:02:38.700> want<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> keep<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
free meat you don't want to keep the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.790 
free meat you don't want to keep the
fins<00:02:39.420> open<00:02:39.690> too<00:02:39.810> long<00:02:40.050> because<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.620> your

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
fins open too long because then your

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.920 
fins open too long because then your
whole<00:02:40.950> chicken<00:02:41.370> population<00:02:41.550> will<00:02:42.180> completely

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
whole chicken population will completely

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.860 
whole chicken population will completely
died

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
died

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.710 
died
that<00:02:45.379> would<00:02:45.500> be<00:02:45.620> bad<00:02:46.239> so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.910 

I<00:02:49.810> can't<00:02:50.230> really<00:02:50.410> give<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.710> demonstration

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
I can't really give you a demonstration

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.220 
I can't really give you a demonstration
right<00:02:51.400> now<00:02:51.640> because<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.240> raining<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.170> I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
right now because it is raining and I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.690 
right now because it is raining and I
pretty<00:02:55.040> sure<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.870> if<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:57.290> raining<00:02:57.700> yeah

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
pretty sure that if it's raining yeah

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.039 
pretty sure that if it's raining yeah
they're<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.709> that's<00:03:00.709> sort<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.040> how<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.220> works

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
they're just that's sort of how it works

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.210 
they're just that's sort of how it works
except<00:03:03.049> for<00:03:03.230> those<00:03:03.319> chickens<00:03:03.769> would<00:03:03.890> be<00:03:04.010> dead

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
except for those chickens would be dead

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.220 
except for those chickens would be dead
and<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.580> would<00:03:04.730> be<00:03:04.760> cooked<00:03:05.090> meat<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.540> think

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and that would be cooked meat I think

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.650 
and that would be cooked meat I think
you<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.319> got<00:03:06.590> smashed<00:03:07.010> or<00:03:07.310> something

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
you just got smashed or something

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.440 
you just got smashed or something
so<00:03:09.400> I'll<00:03:10.400> come<00:03:10.610> back<00:03:10.760> when<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.000> not<00:03:11.240> raining

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
so I'll come back when it's not raining

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.920 
so I'll come back when it's not raining
and<00:03:11.960> give<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.440> demonstration<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:14.690> right

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
and give you a demonstration all right

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.080 
and give you a demonstration all right
so<00:03:15.820> let's<00:03:16.820> see<00:03:17.090> here<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.840> at<00:03:18.020> night<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.680> uh

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
so let's see here it is at night but uh

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.930 
so let's see here it is at night but uh
just<00:03:20.090> finally<00:03:20.720> stopped<00:03:20.990> raining

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.240 

bastard<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.510> right<00:03:27.720> here

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.490 

and<00:03:30.400> operate<00:03:31.150> this

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.809 

so<00:03:39.160> basically

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
so basically

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.550 
so basically
they<00:03:41.299> feel<00:03:41.599> like<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.019> somewhere<00:03:42.469> to<00:03:42.590> walk

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.290 

not<00:03:45.860> and

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
not and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.809 
not and
come<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.630> here<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:47.960> burned

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.990 

works

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.830 

alright<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.190> after<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:01.060> collected<00:04:01.600> them<00:04:01.690> all

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
alright so after you collected them all

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.910 
alright so after you collected them all
if<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.290> do<00:04:02.380> not<00:04:02.530> want<00:04:02.770> them<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:05.470> be<00:04:05.590> collected

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
if you do not want them to be collected

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.760 
if you do not want them to be collected
right<00:04:06.280> there<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.110> obviously<00:04:08.320> need<00:04:08.740> to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
right there so you obviously need to

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.620 
right there so you obviously need to
make<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.160> hole<00:04:09.340> deeper<00:04:09.700> than<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:12.630> see

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
make the hole deeper than this but see

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.120 
make the hole deeper than this but see
they're<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:13.930> going<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.110> dive<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.800> form<00:04:15.070> of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
they're not going to dive in a form of

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.030 
they're not going to dive in a form of
water<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.520> Bernard

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.680 

yeah<00:04:21.340> see<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.970> other<00:04:22.030> one<00:04:22.150> works<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.570> little

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
yeah see the other one works a little

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.730 
yeah see the other one works a little
bit<00:04:22.870> better

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
bit better

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.040 
bit better
see

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.100 

so<00:04:34.050> basically<00:04:34.770> that's<00:04:35.100> what<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:36.600> water<00:04:36.840> one

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
so basically that's what the water one

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.040 
so basically that's what the water one
would<00:04:37.320> look<00:04:37.470> like

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
would look like

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.290 
would look like
except<00:04:39.740> for<00:04:39.770> make<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.370> deeper<00:04:40.669> down<00:04:40.819> and<00:04:41.090> all

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
except for make it deeper down and all

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.679 
except for make it deeper down and all
these<00:04:41.479> would<00:04:41.720> die<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:44.860> explanation<00:04:45.860> on<00:04:45.949> that

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.700 

just<00:04:51.019> put<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.349> water

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
just put the water

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.890 
just put the water
really<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.490> put<00:04:53.640> them<00:04:53.730> in<00:04:53.820> one<00:04:54.000> spot<00:04:54.360> and

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
really you can put them in one spot and

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.920 
really you can put them in one spot and
flow<00:04:55.860> into<00:04:56.310> one

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.400 

so<00:05:02.590> that's<00:05:02.860> how<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.070> do<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:04.229> check<00:05:05.229> out

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
so that's how you do that and check out

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.830 
so that's how you do that and check out
our<00:05:05.440> other<00:05:05.620> tutorials
