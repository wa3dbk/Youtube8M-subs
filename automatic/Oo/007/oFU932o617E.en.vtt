00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
just as sharp as I thought when I first

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.320 
just as sharp as I thought when I first
bought<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:37.190> did<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> stabbing<00:02:38.610> test<00:02:39.030> into<00:02:39.239> a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
bought it I did a stabbing test into a

bought it I did a stabbing test into a
tray<00:02:40.519> nothing<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.760> point<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.180> still<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.569> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
tray nothing the point is still just a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.150 
tray nothing the point is still just a
sharp<00:02:42.959> hiss<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.290> when<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.650> got<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
sharp hiss out when I got it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.789 
sharp hiss out when I got it
when<00:02:44.970> will<00:02:45.090> hard<00:02:45.300> on<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.739> I

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
when will hard on that and when I

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.250 
when will hard on that and when I
stabbed<00:02:47.100> into<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.519> tree<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.330> got<00:02:48.660> about<00:02:48.900> this

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
stabbed into the tree it got about this

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.380 
stabbed into the tree it got about this
far<00:02:49.319> in<00:02:51.319> without<00:02:52.319> much<00:02:52.530> effort<00:02:52.739> at<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.390> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
far in without much effort at all and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.270 
far in without much effort at all and
when<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:54.780> chopping<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.260> wood<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.680> pretty

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
when I was chopping the wood I pretty

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.490 
when I was chopping the wood I pretty
much<00:02:56.370> used<00:02:56.850> most<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.019> my<00:02:58.440> force<00:03:00.049> really<00:03:01.049> really

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
much used most of my force really really

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.440 
much used most of my force really really
put<00:03:01.920> into<00:03:02.069> this<00:03:02.220> blade<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:03.030> telling<00:03:03.390> you

put into this blade and I'm telling you

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.509 
put into this blade and I'm telling you
guys<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:04.560> held<00:03:04.799> up<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.190> fine<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.790> was<00:03:06.450> cutting

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
guys it held up just fine I was cutting

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.210 
guys it held up just fine I was cutting
between<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.760> five<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.630> seven<00:03:10.380> inch<00:03:10.530> branch<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
between a five and seven inch branch a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.059 
between a five and seven inch branch a
couple<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.970> them<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.769> cut<00:03:13.769> them<00:03:13.890> all<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
couple of them actually cut them all the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.910 
couple of them actually cut them all the
way<00:03:14.160> through<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.630> actually<00:03:15.870> used<00:03:16.380> pieces

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
way through and I actually used pieces

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.699 
way through and I actually used pieces
of<00:03:17.190> those<00:03:17.310> branches<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.359> sharpen<00:03:19.290> them<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.590> if

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
of those branches to sharpen them as if

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.550 
of those branches to sharpen them as if
they<00:03:19.799> were<00:03:19.829> Spears<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:21.359> hit<00:03:21.570> did<00:03:21.780> everything

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
they were Spears and hit did everything

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.590 
they were Spears and hit did everything
and<00:03:22.829> more<00:03:23.750> okay<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:26.459> feels<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:27.090> good<00:03:27.480> in

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
and more okay it feels really good in

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.830 
and more okay it feels really good in
the<00:03:27.690> hand<00:03:27.799> really<00:03:28.799> does<00:03:29.130> I'm<00:03:30.060> supremely

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
impressed and here you a little hole

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.650 
impressed and here you a little hole
here<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> lanyard<00:03:34.530> or<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.040> paracord

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
here for a lanyard or a paracord

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.610 
here for a lanyard or a paracord
probably<00:03:36.660> do<00:03:36.720> something<00:03:36.930> with<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.260> down<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
probably do something with that down the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.379 
probably do something with that down the
road<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:40.380> know<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> eight<00:03:41.970> I

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
road you know this this is a eight I

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.150 
road you know this this is a eight I
believe<00:03:43.079> it's<00:03:43.230> eight<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.590> three-quarter

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
believe it's eight and three-quarter

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.789 
believe it's eight and three-quarter
inch<00:03:44.310> over<00:03:45.239> more<00:03:45.450> than<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.630> maybe<00:03:45.950> blade<00:03:47.420> and

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
inch over more than that maybe blade and

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.990 
inch over more than that maybe blade and
actually<00:03:49.799> I'm<00:03:49.920> surprised<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.609> actually

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
actually I'm surprised this is actually

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.180 
actually I'm surprised this is actually
not<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.359> real<00:03:51.630> size<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> bowie<00:03:52.769> knife<00:03:52.889> and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
not the real size for a bowie knife and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.099 
not the real size for a bowie knife and
I<00:03:53.250> always<00:03:53.430> thought<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.970> bowie<00:03:54.150> knife<00:03:54.239> was

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
I always thought that a bowie knife was

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.930 
I always thought that a bowie knife was
around<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.500> size<00:03:55.739> but<00:03:56.069> originally<00:03:56.760> they<00:03:56.880> were

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
around the size but originally they were

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.819 
around the size but originally they were
much<00:03:57.239> bigger<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.739> said<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:01.650> you're

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
much bigger that said for what you're

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.250 
much bigger that said for what you're
going<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.069> need<00:04:02.250> for<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.209> most<00:04:03.450> part<00:04:03.720> this

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
going to need for the most part this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.910 
going to need for the most part this
right<00:04:04.620> here<00:04:06.290> fits<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.500> bill

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
right here fits the bill

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.370 
right here fits the bill
it<00:04:08.130> really<00:04:08.370> does<00:04:08.690> it's<00:04:09.690> got<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> couple<00:04:10.230> little

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
believe I'm not mistaken the sheath does

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.479

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
you can see one that actually came from

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.080 
you can see one that actually came from
from<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.479> factory<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.080> that

from the factory like that

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.350 
from the factory like that
but<00:04:27.090> really<00:04:27.720> doesn't<00:04:28.050> bother<00:04:28.140> me<00:04:28.350> too<00:04:28.500> much

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360
