00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
guitar again this is actually a solid

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.110 
guitar again this is actually a solid
maple<00:03:11.760> top<00:03:12.540> okay<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:13.470> not<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:14.489> not<00:03:14.670> veneer

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
solid maple and this maple is very

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.369 
solid maple and this maple is very
unique<00:03:24.629> looking<00:03:26.750> ESP<00:03:27.750> actually<00:03:28.019> got<00:03:28.199> this

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
unique looking ESP actually got this

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.830 
unique looking ESP actually got this
maple<00:03:28.799> from<00:03:28.980> Austria<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:30.269> places<00:03:30.510> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
maple from Austria of all places and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360 
maple from Austria of all places and
what<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.019> think<00:03:31.349> they<00:03:31.440> were<00:03:31.500> seeking<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.980> mimic

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
what I think they were seeking to mimic

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.360 
what I think they were seeking to mimic
at<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.639> time<00:03:32.849> was<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.419> look<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.859> classic

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
at the time was the look of the classic

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.240 
at the time was the look of the classic
vintage<00:03:35.910> violins<00:03:36.720> okay<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.500> they<00:03:37.709> figured

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
vintage violins okay so they figured

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.939 
vintage violins okay so they figured
that<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.840> guess<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.870> Austria<00:03:40.530> was<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.769> place

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
that I guess that Austria was the place

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.670 
that I guess that Austria was the place
to<00:03:41.129> get<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.280> type<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.669> violin<00:03:42.269> look<00:03:42.680> figured

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
to get that type of violin look figured

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.420 
to get that type of violin look figured
maple<00:03:44.599> you'll<00:03:45.599> see<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.650> maple<00:03:47.069> on

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
maple you'll see here that the maple on

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.460 
maple you'll see here that the maple on
these<00:03:47.669> ESP<00:03:48.299> built<00:03:48.510> navigators<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.260> very

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
these ESP built navigators is very

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.509 
these ESP built navigators is very
unique<00:03:49.739> looking<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.940> flame<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
unique looking not just the flame and

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.490 
unique looking not just the flame and
the<00:03:53.519> figure<00:03:53.849> but<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.329> see<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.690> those<00:03:55.169> dark

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the figure but you see that those dark

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.080 
the figure but you see that those dark
spots<00:03:55.650> that's<00:03:56.069> actually<00:03:56.340> not<00:03:56.459> damaged

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
spots that's actually not damaged

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.059 
spots that's actually not damaged
that's<00:03:57.419> not<00:03:57.629> where<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.680> actually<00:03:59.010> a

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
that's not where that's actually a

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.800 
that's not where that's actually a
feature<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.730> wood<00:03:59.909> itself<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.480> maple

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
feature of the wood itself the maple

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.300 
feature of the wood itself the maple
itself<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.699> often<00:04:03.079> these<00:04:04.079> true<00:04:04.470> ESP<00:04:04.919> build

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.439 
itself and so often these true ESP build
navigators<00:04:05.790> will<00:04:05.940> have<00:04:06.090> those<00:04:06.299> little

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
navigators will have those little

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.180 
navigators will have those little
imperfections<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.470> dark<00:04:07.680> spots<00:04:07.829> that's

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
imperfections and dark spots that's

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.140 
imperfections and dark spots that's
something<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.519> look<00:04:08.579> for<00:04:08.909> if<00:04:09.000> you're<00:04:09.120> looking

pots sit in the control cavity route is

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.909 
pots sit in the control cavity route is
like<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.020> sort<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.699> deep<00:05:13.780> X<00:05:14.780> or<00:05:15.410> cross

like in this sort of deep X or cross
shape<00:05:16.310> route<00:05:16.880> so<00:05:17.270> look<00:05:17.479> for<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.659> very<00:05:18.620> unique

this<00:05:25.970> guitar<00:05:26.090> but<00:05:26.539> if<00:05:26.720> we<00:05:26.900> were<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.169> strip<00:05:27.620> to

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
this guitar but if we were to strip to

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.290 
this guitar but if we were to strip to
finish<00:05:28.069> off<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.400> front<00:05:28.639> of<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.819> headstock
