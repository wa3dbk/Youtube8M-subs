00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.609
 And there it goes all right, let's talk 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.859
 on the beaches of Canada 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.080
 the video of curiosity quickly and yes 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.730
 in Canada there is also everything beach has 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.220
 a lot of people think that in Canada 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 gets cold around the only snow that 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.930
 guys temperature below zero 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.539
 but then at the end of spring and in the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
 summer and early autumn on cymbals 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 very nice 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.470
 It's hotter, and the time to look. 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 a beach 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.929
 so although the country is a very 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.449
 large has a very large region if 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:40.379
 kernels of the country that is far from the coast far 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.629
 from the sea to Canada has many lakes and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.699
 Canadian takes to ride and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.249
 to install the beaches of the lakes 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.989
 then probably near the city where 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.539
 Do you intend to live with your search? 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 probably there you will find a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.920
 beach that sovereign beach as the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 People find in Brazil but for whom 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.850
 there are those who like the sun who like 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.409
 take a shower is a good tip you can give 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.750
 To give a little part of the city 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.720
 and six bikes who is a real beach 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 You will have to go to the Caribbean and is in 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.710
 East Coast which is on the west coast 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.840
 to california hawaii 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.050
 It's good the beaches they usually stay 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 in municipal or provincial parks 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.590
 so almost on all the beaches here in the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.110
 Canada you have to pay 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.240
 to use the beach is actually a bad 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.290
 rate they charge just look for 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.290
 local maintenance is sometimes 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.030
 near the beach has a fellow place 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.510
 by dressing room sometimes has some 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.510
 places have restaurant anyway and something to 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.430
 rate can vary between 3 to 10 dollars and 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.320
 may vary may be slightly more expensive 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.800
 and sometimes also includes 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 parking but worth it very much 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.020
 tasty 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.460
 I'm actually in a beach state today. 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.590

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.750
 here is the city with the fc porto is well 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.510
 north of new york state beats 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.880
 on the border with Canada and where I live 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.860
 in montreal is also close to the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.840
 united states border montreal 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.950
 It takes about 30 minutes to leave 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.380
 car to the border and clash is at 30 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.410
 minutes of the authorship of Canada then 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.240
 to make a turn back of an hour of 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.950
 road is a place we like 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.959
 quite this lake calls lake champlain 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.770
 in the name of the great lake is here in the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.010
 region 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.650
 So I invite you to research 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.270
 placed in the survey of you beaches 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.590
 see if there's a beach near the city 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.750
 Where do you intend to live? 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.820
 you should probably have some water and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.780
 treatment is a beach that sits on the river 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.160
 the water is chilled money but it is fresh water 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.630
 it's very nice 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.340
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.340
