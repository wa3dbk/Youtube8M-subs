 rubric on my channel this rubric will 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 relatively useful in this whisper eat 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.990
 three video categories 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.179
 The first is a video tutorial on sony vegas pro 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 10 the second is a video lessons on adobe 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.770
 Photoshop though there is not a master but so that I 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.660
 I can show you there and 3 advises 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.680
 Todayâ€™s bloggers will have a video lesson on 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 sony vegas pro 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.449
 today you will know the most basic i 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 I will pay crop video add pictures 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.160
 text to report music and a little bit 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 talk about transitions or video effect 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.880
 commercials scheduling anything to say that I am not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.500
 master explain therefore basically 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.660
 rely on your vision they are on your 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.100
 hearing and let's get started 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.210
 process and first we add 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 video 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.370
 sony vegas and yes i have russian version i 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.879
 I increased the video because I work like this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 more comfortable here and started talking 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.640
 Russian letter and or English s and this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 removing here again claims from here and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.699
 dachshund began to issue add text 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.299
 create another track left pasok 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.580
 press enter text media or go 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.189
 data generator and there is a text folder 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.710
 choose text about men I choose 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.229
 simple because it's more convenient for me and 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 We write, in principle, that you can choose 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.970
 font 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.920
 but the sheriff only acts in English 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.920
 so choose a stroke 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.300
 we reduce the size 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.590
 run not and i use this thing 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.110
 can be different but it is more convenient for me 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.730
 Now we will insert pictures so I 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 add even track 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.030
 Lithuanian picture you can click open 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.210
 and look like this so push the panorama 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.020
 pruning fragments further interfere to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.060
 whose size you need maxims so video 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.810
 effects video effects applied like on 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.570
 a picture like this for example let's 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.230
 add some and see 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.170
 add pictures text changed color 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.330

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.400
 picture 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.380
 transitions transitions put 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.610
 and only in the video also in the picture 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.730
 text for example just trim the video 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.560
 add pictures 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.260
 appearance that is, in principle, you understand 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.400
 now about music we create sound 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.420
