here today with my video I will be
talking<00:00:12.300> about<00:00:12.780> an<00:00:13.139> article<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.280> rockstar

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
talking about an article on the rockstar

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.970 
talking about an article on the rockstar
games<00:00:15.030> website<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.109> support<00:00:16.529> website<00:00:16.740> or

whatever<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.369> rockstar<00:00:17.760> games<00:00:18.380> basically

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
whatever for rockstar games basically

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170 
whatever for rockstar games basically
it's<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.859> motorcycle<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.580> bike<00:00:20.820> stunt

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it's about the motorcycle and bike stunt

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.849 
it's about the motorcycle and bike stunt
physics<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> will<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.470> screen<00:00:22.680> right

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
physics as you will see on screen right

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.150 
physics as you will see on screen right
now<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.570> they're<00:00:24.570> basically<00:00:25.050> putting<00:00:25.560> back<00:00:25.890> in

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
now on they're basically putting back in

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
now on they're basically putting back in
stunting<00:00:26.789> by<00:00:27.630> adding<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.019> gliding<00:00:28.470> feature

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
stunting by adding the gliding feature

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.299 
stunting by adding the gliding feature

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010 
whatever bikes she did it with it will
be<00:00:37.739> back<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> next<00:00:38.430> title<00:00:38.670> update<00:00:39.020> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
be back in the next title update and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450 
be back in the next title update and
yeah<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> question

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
yeah as you can see here the question

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
yeah as you can see here the question
says<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.120> recent<00:00:42.510> title<00:00:42.960> update<00:00:43.079> changed<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
says a recent title update changed the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
says a recent title update changed the
way<00:00:43.800> motorcycles<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> bikes<00:00:45.000> control<00:00:45.600> in

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
way motorcycles and bikes control in

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
way motorcycles and bikes control in
wall<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.350> midair<00:00:46.670> making<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:47.940> difficult

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
wall in midair making it more difficult

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
wall in midair making it more difficult
to<00:00:48.390> pull<00:00:48.690> off<00:00:48.809> certain<00:00:49.020> stunts<00:00:49.590> why<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to pull off certain stunts why did this

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
to pull off certain stunts why did this
change<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> question<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.079> someone

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
change so that was a question by someone

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
change so that was a question by someone
I<00:00:52.469> guess<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> they<00:00:53.340> asked<00:00:53.699> rockstar<00:00:54.149> games

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
I guess that they asked rockstar games

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
I guess that they asked rockstar games
and<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:54.930> said<00:00:55.170> their<00:00:55.949> answer<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.309> we

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and they said their answer is we

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
and they said their answer is we
recently<00:00:56.969> fixed<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> bug<00:00:57.690> involving<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> way

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
recently fixed the bug involving the way

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.200 
recently fixed the bug involving the way
motorcycles<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> bikes<00:00:59.520> handled<00:00:59.969> wall<00:01:00.120> in

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
motorcycles and bikes handled wall in

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
motorcycles and bikes handled wall in
midair<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.750> their<00:01:01.530> wall<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> air<00:01:02.010> since

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
midair on their wall in the air since

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.369 
midair on their wall in the air since
then<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.390> received<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:03.960> feedback<00:01:04.140> from

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
then we have received some feedback from

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.020 
then we have received some feedback from
the<00:01:04.650> stunting<00:01:05.070> community<00:01:05.549> letting<00:01:05.880> us<00:01:06.000> know

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the stunting community letting us know

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
the stunting community letting us know
how<00:01:06.659> much<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.020> enjoyed<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> old<00:01:07.710> handling

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
how much they enjoyed the old handling

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
how much they enjoyed the old handling
so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> original<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.420> air<00:01:09.630> bike<00:01:09.900> physics<00:01:10.380> will

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so the original in air bike physics will

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.850 
so the original in air bike physics will
be<00:01:10.799> restored<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.700> future<00:01:12.119> title<00:01:12.630> update<00:01:12.860> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
be restored in a future title update so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
be restored in a future title update so
I'm<00:01:14.010> assuming<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> next<00:01:15.030> title<00:01:15.180> update

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
I'm assuming in the next title update

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
I'm assuming in the next title update
they<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.900> add<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.590> stunting<00:01:17.189> or

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
they will add back in stunting or

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
they will add back in stunting or
gliding<00:01:17.909> whatever<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> call<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
gliding whatever you want to call it and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.020 
gliding whatever you want to call it and
after<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> says<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.640> would<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.210 
basically says they're going to be
adding<00:01:39.630> stunting<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.829> very<00:01:41.070> very

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
adding stunting back that's very very

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
adding stunting back that's very very
cool<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.640> I've<00:01:41.850> actually<00:01:41.909> found<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.540> lot

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
cool because I've actually found a lot

and stuff like that that I haven't been
able<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:48.810> gliding<00:01:49.439> has<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:50.399> been

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
able to do because gliding has not been

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
able to do because gliding has not been
in<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> while<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.960> hopefully<00:01:52.530> next

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
in there for a while but hopefully next

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.620 
in there for a while but hopefully next
title<00:01:53.070> update<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:53.759> add<00:01:53.909> stunting<00:01:54.420> back

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
title update they will add stunting back

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
title update they will add stunting back
in<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.049> point<00:01:55.290> 12<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.740> guess<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.310> probably

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
in one point 12 I guess that's probably

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.370 
in one point 12 I guess that's probably
what's<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.060> cold<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.840> yeah<00:01:58.200> it's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
what's going to be cold so yeah it's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.660 
what's going to be cold so yeah it's
going<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.740> amazing<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.219> something's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
going to be amazing when something's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.069 
going to be amazing when something's
back<00:01:59.880> there's<00:02:00.210> gonna<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> lot<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.689> stun

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
back there's gonna be a lot more stun

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.560 
back there's gonna be a lot more stun
montages<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> while<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
montages because for a while now the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
montages because for a while now the
suns<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.020> community<00:02:04.469> has<00:02:04.619> been<00:02:04.829> quite<00:02:05.159> low<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
suns in community has been quite low and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
suns in community has been quite low and
like<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.509> very<00:02:06.719> active<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.229> guess<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.469> could

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
like not very active I guess you could

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.229 
like not very active I guess you could
say<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:08.129> gliding<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> game

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
say because gliding is not in the game

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.530 
say because gliding is not in the game
so<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.259> yeah<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.890> guys<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:12.030> enjoy<00:02:12.390> this

back most people did it did not really
harm<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> game<00:02:16.410> whatsoever<00:02:16.710> i<00:02:16.980> don't<00:02:17.220> know

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
why they took it out but apparently

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.720 
why they took it out but apparently
enough<00:02:19.080> people<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> stunting<00:02:20.400> videos

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
enough people like the stunting videos

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.360 
enough people like the stunting videos
that<00:02:20.940> had<00:02:21.090> at<00:02:21.360> rockstar<00:02:21.930> games<00:02:21.959> at<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> end<00:02:22.650> so
