button which is usually used for your
exposure<00:00:55.620> lock<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.460> autofocus<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.360> your

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
control and your auto focus therefore

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
control and your auto focus therefore
you<00:01:12.149> know<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.450> camera's<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.869> trying<00:01:13.380> to

because<00:02:54.730> every<00:02:55.390> camera<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.990> could<00:02:56.170> be<00:02:56.290> a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
because every camera it could be a

because every camera it could be a
different<00:02:56.650> custom<00:02:56.980> function<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.460> it<00:02:57.520> would

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
different custom function and it would

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.460 
different custom function and it would
take<00:02:57.790> forever<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.570> it's<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.930> your<00:02:58.960> camera

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470

you can go online i'm sure and find one

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.720 
you can go online i'm sure and find one
a<00:03:30.790> PDF<00:03:31.240> version<00:03:31.270> of<00:03:31.690> one<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:33.100> check<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.550> out

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
a PDF version of one so check that out

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.540 
a PDF version of one so check that out
also<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.660> need<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.870> try<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.470> for<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.340> little

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
also you need to try it for a little

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.400 
also you need to try it for a little
while<00:03:36.760> don't<00:03:37.090> use<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.570> once<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.080> give<00:03:38.260> up

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
while don't use it once and give up

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.110 
while don't use it once and give up
because<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.860> can<00:03:38.980> be<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.340> little<00:03:39.670> weird<00:03:39.880> at

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
because it can be a little weird at

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.430 
because it can be a little weird at
first<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.630> definitely<00:03:40.750> take<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.230> little

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
first it can definitely take a little

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.770 
first it can definitely take a little
time<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.830> get<00:03:41.920> used<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:43.030> once<00:03:43.270> you<00:03:43.510> get<00:03:43.660> it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
time to get used to but once you get it
