 what is a new scheme concerning 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.460
 what is my namesake that aysÃ©n 6 with what 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.259
 which is the forbidden youtube of the eight 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.230
 doors that good is what it uses 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.550
 to fight against wood is to put 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.590
 the people who have not seen the manga but 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 Well, this one now, yes, there is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.309

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.719
 because what is this is that I'm going to 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.850
 show below show us 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.500
 several things that are good they are a little 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.540
 obvious because they were mentioned 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.460
 that the game was going to end or was going to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.470
 finish manga story no but 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.240
 Well, as always, these are 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.470
 cannes do not come bad for people 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.540
 that is not completely frozen 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.150
 precisely from the aspect of the sleeve like this 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.730
 Well, he does not know these details 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.800
 in this especially what is the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.329
 character is confirmed as part of 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.980
 the campaign is confirmed as 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.869
 playable character and well then here 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.210
 same comes the confirmation of what is 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.040
 kill the zhenning resource that good 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.720
 Well, a couple of days ago and well 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 had confirmed a week or so 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.980
 but nevertheless there was a problem with 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.210
 the design that good what was your cane 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.280
 it showed a design at the end it 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.930
 will implement as a stick ok then 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.550
 well then in this same rest 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.490
 shows in the same way I do not know why 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.680
 but good show us what it is to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.750
 character with the design that will be 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.760
 occupying what is the game that good 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.590
 it will be as covered with flames 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.740
 red and well then now it is the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.720
 eighth door the simon hack and well then 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.370
 Let 's say this is going to be will have two 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.260
 functions will work like what it is 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.090
 his last youtube of the character was going to 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.710
 work as your wake up mode 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 obviously the true this bolt the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 instant awakening as I eat it 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.500
 want to call 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.330
 but well, it will work from this 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.130
 way they also show us a bit of 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.630
 what is the appearance of the new naruto 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.090
 that also brought that cane that does not 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.950
 brings completion that seems simply 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.720
 a stick and well it speaks to us a little 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.460
 of what is the youtube that is going to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.470
 contain what the character is not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.270
 we also like a little bit of you know that 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.310
 with what is the sidor and perfected 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.660
 with the susano and good as I like them 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 mentioned they show the wood and what 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.100
 mentioned as a playable character not as 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.930
 he mentioned them because here he would be a 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 little but good here the important thing is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.110
 how it will work what it is then in 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.629
 this case 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.060
 maite ok 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.090
 the eight doors that will work for 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.099
 the next way they're going to have it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.629
 as last youtube and as good fusion 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.670
 So what is the awakening mode? 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.860
 obviously this is going to be a variation 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.540
 of the character for which we will have the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.540
 variation of what is 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.020
 the real favor blow if I'm not wrong and 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.370
 the turn dora in Japanese the other and good 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.050
 Well, this is going to be the third variation 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.720
 I doubt they're going to remove some so 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.700
 we will have three einstein 6 to play in 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.500
 what it is to be a quarter more then 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.770
 an agent the information is in party to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.660
 be a little more common let's say what 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.130
 good the reasons that the game then 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.050
 It is practically around the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.880
 corner is a few months away for its 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.890
 output taking into account the output of 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.660
 revolution but good people I hope 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.460
 that you liked do not forget to leave your 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.840
 like share it with your friends and good 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.160
 Well here I say goodbye we see the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.160
 next and bye
