seeing young young Pete Kerr this

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.279 
seeing young young Pete Kerr this
morning<00:00:37.039> and<00:00:37.269> first<00:00:38.269> thing<00:00:38.539> he<00:00:38.629> said<00:00:38.899> was<00:00:39.050> I

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
morning and first thing he said was I

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.099 
morning and first thing he said was I
feel<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:40.070> I've<00:00:40.219> just<00:00:40.249> written<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.699> Grand<00:00:40.940> Tour

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
feel like I've just written a Grand Tour

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.639 
feel like I've just written a Grand Tour
but<00:00:42.559> yeah<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.949> good<00:00:43.489> good<00:00:43.879> boost<00:00:44.089> of<00:00:44.269> confidence

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
but yeah a good good boost of confidence

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.279 
but yeah a good good boost of confidence
I<00:00:45.649> think<00:00:46.249> it<00:00:46.370> definitely<00:00:46.730> shows<00:00:46.940> I'm<00:00:47.269> where<00:00:48.260> I

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
I think it definitely shows I'm where I

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.069 
I think it definitely shows I'm where I
need<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.829> physically<00:00:49.489> at<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:49.999> point<00:00:50.300> I

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
need to be physically at this point I

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.439 
need to be physically at this point I
think<00:00:52.039> a<00:00:52.159> little<00:00:52.399> bit<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.819> little<00:00:53.210> bit<00:00:53.300> more

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
think a little bit a little bit more

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.479 
think a little bit a little bit more
work<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.659> do<00:00:53.960> touching<00:00:54.589> on<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:55.039> shaving<00:00:55.280> off

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
work to do touching on just shaving off

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.950 
work to do touching on just shaving off
a<00:00:55.519> little<00:00:56.239> bit<00:00:56.359> of<00:00:56.449> extra<00:00:56.780> weight<00:00:56.929> and

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
a little bit of extra weight and

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.969 
a little bit of extra weight and
touching<00:00:59.960> on<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.079> bit<00:01:00.260> more<00:01:00.409> a<00:01:00.440> bit<00:01:00.530> more<00:01:00.710> work

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
touching on a bit more a bit more work

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.459 
touching on a bit more a bit more work
before<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.399> tour<00:01:01.579> now<00:01:01.760> at<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:02.569> point<00:01:02.809> it's

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
before the tour now at this point it's

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.440 
before the tour now at this point it's
not<00:01:03.620> necessarily<00:01:04.250> about<00:01:04.309> really<00:01:04.880> chasing<00:01:05.150> it

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
not necessarily about really chasing it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.200 
not necessarily about really chasing it
now<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.810> think<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.440> works<00:01:06.680> done<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.120> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
now I think the works done it's in the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.500 
now I think the works done it's in the
bank<00:01:08.420> already<00:01:09.520> especially<00:01:10.520> after<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.150> Delfin

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
bank already especially after the Delfin

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.270 
bank already especially after the Delfin
air<00:01:11.630> now<00:01:11.780> such<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.080> hard<00:01:12.380> dolphin<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.830> was<00:01:13.040> just

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.070 
air now such a hard dolphin I was just
it's<00:01:13.820> good<00:01:14.030> now<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.540> take<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.750> few<00:01:14.870> days

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's good now just to take a few days

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.390 
it's good now just to take a few days
relatively<00:01:15.830> easy<00:01:16.010> suck<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.030> up<00:01:17.120> I<00:01:18.370> mean<00:01:19.370> you

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
relatively easy suck it up I mean you

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.250 
relatively easy suck it up I mean you
don't<00:01:19.730> want<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.030> get<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> tour<00:01:20.570> feeling

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
don't want to get to the tour feeling

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.550 
don't want to get to the tour feeling
tired<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:23.120> biggest<00:01:23.840> thing<00:01:24.020> going<00:01:24.050> into<00:01:24.500> a

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
tired the biggest thing going into a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.020 
tired the biggest thing going into a
three-week<00:01:24.980> race<00:01:25.160> I<00:01:25.370> think<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.850> be<00:01:25.940> as

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
three-week race I think is to be as

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.520 
three-week race I think is to be as
fresh<00:01:26.300> as<00:01:26.480> possible<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.910> so<00:01:28.910> it's<00:01:29.350> it's<00:01:30.350> also

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
fresh as possible and so it's it's also

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.250 
fresh as possible and so it's it's also
trying<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.950> balance<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.700> time<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.260> getting

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
trying to balance that time of getting

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.690 
trying to balance that time of getting
that<00:01:33.350> mental<00:01:33.800> break<00:01:33.980> of<00:01:34.190> being<00:01:34.400> at<00:01:34.490> home<00:01:34.520> and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
that mental break of being at home and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.390 
that mental break of being at home and
relaxing<00:01:35.570> before<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:36.100> before<00:01:37.100> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
can't even begin to think about how

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
because it's I mean you could be you

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.569 
because it's I mean you could be you
could<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.319> minutes<00:02:37.709> down<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.159> could<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:38.459> out

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
could be minutes down you could be out

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.360 
could be minutes down you could be out
of<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.790> race<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.359> mean<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.099> as<00:02:41.099> you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
of the race you I mean it's just as you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.759 
of the race you I mean it's just as you
said<00:02:41.489> it's<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.200> action-packed<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.500> first

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
said it's just so action-packed as first

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.319 
said it's just so action-packed as first
few<00:02:43.950> days<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.430> basically<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.060> different

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
few days is basically a different

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.839 
few days is basically a different
classic<00:02:45.930> everyday<00:02:46.379> yeah<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.489> going<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.730> be

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
classic everyday yeah it's going to be

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.449 
classic everyday yeah it's going to be
tricky<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.359> think<00:02:48.599> before<00:02:49.459> before

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
tricky and I think before before

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.780 
tricky and I think before before
anything<00:02:50.819> else<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.829> focus<00:02:53.069> just<00:02:53.250> has<00:02:53.579> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
anything else the the focus just has to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.309 
anything else the the focus just has to
be<00:02:53.819> on<00:02:54.060> getting<00:02:54.209> through<00:02:54.480> those<00:02:54.689> days<00:02:54.930> without

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
be on getting through those days without

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.530 
be on getting through those days without
any<00:02:55.500> issues<00:02:55.859> final<00:02:56.579> week<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.000> tour<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.389> what

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
any issues final week the tour is what

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.940 
any issues final week the tour is what
everyone's<00:02:57.900> kind<00:02:58.109> of<00:02:58.169> speculative<00:02:58.680> at<00:02:58.799> so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
everyone's kind of speculative at so

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.559 
everyone's kind of speculative at so
let's<00:02:59.459> say<00:02:59.609> we<00:02:59.730> all<00:02:59.849> get<00:03:00.000> through<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.359> first

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
let's say we all get through the first

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.899 
let's say we all get through the first
week<00:03:00.780> unscathed<00:03:01.590> how<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.669> go<00:03:02.790> about

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
week unscathed how do you go about

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.470 
week unscathed how do you go about

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
managing your form - to come to a peak

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.569 
managing your form - to come to a peak
and<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:07.109> at<00:03:07.200> your<00:03:07.319> best<00:03:07.590> for<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.129> end<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
and be at your best for the end of a

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.890 
and be at your best for the end of a
three-week<00:03:09.030> tour<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.389> that's<00:03:09.540> something<00:03:09.659> that

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
three-week tour is that's something that

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.559 
three-week tour is that's something that
is<00:03:10.079> quite<00:03:10.500> complicated<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:11.219> do<00:03:11.310> yeah<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.389> mean

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
is quite complicated to do yeah I mean

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.159 
is quite complicated to do yeah I mean
it<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:13.379> that's<00:03:14.159> that's<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.450> golden

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
it really that's that's the golden

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.050 
it really that's that's the golden
question<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.680> mean<00:03:16.829> there's<00:03:17.099> no<00:03:17.250> secret

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
question I mean there's no secret

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.860 
question I mean there's no secret
formula<00:03:18.090> or<00:03:18.780> no<00:03:20.090> best<00:03:21.090> way<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.359> doing<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.780> I

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
formula or no best way of doing it I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.539 
formula or no best way of doing it I
think<00:03:21.930> each<00:03:22.229> person<00:03:22.260> has<00:03:22.889> has<00:03:23.250> their<00:03:23.430> own

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
think each person has has their own

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.640 
think each person has has their own
individual<00:03:24.180> way<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.449> getting<00:03:24.780> there<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.199> I've

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
individual way of getting there and I've

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.409 
individual way of getting there and I've
done<00:03:25.919> some<00:03:26.159> grand<00:03:26.430> tours<00:03:26.729> where<00:03:26.909> I<00:03:26.940> feel<00:03:27.150> like

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
done some grand tours where I feel like

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.849 
done some grand tours where I feel like
I<00:03:27.599> get<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.079> third<00:03:28.319> week<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.739> I'm

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
I get to that third week and I'm

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.699 
I get to that third week and I'm
basically<00:03:29.250> just<00:03:29.340> hanging<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:31.560> look

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
basically just hanging on but if I look

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.949 
basically just hanging on but if I look
at<00:03:31.919> his<00:03:32.459> welter<00:03:32.819> last<00:03:33.030> year<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.329> think<00:03:33.479> that<00:03:33.659> was

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
at his welter last year I think that was

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.890 
at his welter last year I think that was
in<00:03:34.769> terms<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.459> going<00:03:35.819> into<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.180> Grand<00:03:36.449> Tour<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
in terms of going into a Grand Tour that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.929 
in terms of going into a Grand Tour that
was<00:03:37.049> probably<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.439> best<00:03:37.560> way<00:03:37.889> of<00:03:38.189> feeling

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
was probably the best way of feeling

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.569 
was probably the best way of feeling
wise<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.810> I've<00:03:40.079> ever<00:03:40.349> had<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.739> was<00:03:40.919> going
