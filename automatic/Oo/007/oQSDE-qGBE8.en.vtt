 ----- warning!! -----. I produce videos for Japanese people who are common sense, such as religion, politics, ethics and morals. These may be different from your country's common sense. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 ----- warning!! -----. If you try to look only at your country's values, you may find it uncomfortable. If this is not acceptable, please stop playing the video now. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 This subtitle has been adjusted for the "Google Machine Translation System". (It may be different from the original.)

 Cheap LED lights. Revenge. January 10, 2013 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello !! I am "YUKKURI" of the famous voice actor in Japan. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Today is my mother's birthday, so I'm going to buy cookies. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 The cookies made at this store are very delicious. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 That aside, the flow of cars is very slow from the beginning. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I thought it was a traffic jam. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 A police car was running. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Because the police car is running ahead, there is no worry of getting caught. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 But the speed limit is too slow. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Speaking of which, a new car of "YAMAHA RZ50" was posted on the motorcycle buying and selling information site. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 330,000 yen. ($ 3703.70 / Rate $ 1 = 89.10 yen) 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 It is expensive because it is a valuable car. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Parody of horse racing in Japan 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 I can not translate. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Since it is not common, there are not many people who can understand this content even in Japan. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 LED lights purchased at 100yen. Fix with tape etc. (TEST) 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 (100yen = $ 1.12 / Rate $ 1 = 89.10yen) 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 I will try position and bonding method later. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Left, 100yen LED light. Right, headlights. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 The 100yen LED is brighter than the headlight. ;-( 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 bonus 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Left, GENTOS 100 lm. Right, 100yen LED light.

 Left, GENTOS 100 lm. Right, GENTOS 200 lm. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Left, GENTOS 100 lm. Right, GENTOS 500 lm. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Drama. "Family Time" 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Please turn off the room light. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 (Sound like water) 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Turn on the room light. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 It is the sound of eating ice.
