00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's a say in 7 points so you get the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
mid-axillary abdomen and thigh so once

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.350 
mid-axillary abdomen and thigh so once
you<00:01:40.960> calculate<00:01:41.170> body<00:01:41.740> density<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.940> can<00:01:43.149> then

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
you calculate body density you can then

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.840 
you calculate body density you can then
calculate<00:01:43.899> percent<00:01:44.680> body<00:01:44.890> fat<00:01:45.040> using<00:01:45.610> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
calculate percent body fat using the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.600 
calculate percent body fat using the
equation<00:01:46.270> by<00:01:46.539> Siri<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:47.799> percent<00:01:48.220> body<00:01:48.460> fat

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
equation by Siri and so percent body fat

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.749 
equation by Siri and so percent body fat
equals<00:01:49.890> four<00:01:50.890> hundred<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.280> ninety<00:01:51.610> five

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
equals four hundred and ninety five

00:01:51.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
equals four hundred and ninety five
divided<00:01:52.450> by<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.750> body<00:01:53.110> density<00:01:54.360> minus<00:01:55.680> 450

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.260 

so<00:02:03.300> if<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.660> back<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.840> sample<00:02:07.170> female

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
so if we go back to our sample female

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.440 
so if we go back to our sample female
here<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.570> her<00:02:09.780> skinful<00:02:10.380> measures<00:02:11.330> we're<00:02:12.330> not

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
here are her skinful measures we're not

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.330 
here are her skinful measures we're not
going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.750> use<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.200> these<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.220> be

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
going to use all of these but we will be

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.440 
going to use all of these but we will be

other<00:02:28.920> metrics<00:02:29.520> but<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.380> equation

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
other metrics but for this equation

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.360 
other metrics but for this equation
these<00:02:32.160> are<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.520> seven<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.240> use<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
these are the seven that we use and the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.560 
these are the seven that we use and the
sum<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:36.000> these<00:02:36.650> seven<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:39.209> SS<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:43.010> equal<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
sum of these seven so SS is equal to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.560 
sum of these seven so SS is equal to
hundred<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:46.110> fifteen<00:02:46.650> point<00:02:47.550> six<00:02:49.430> buildings

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
hundred and fifteen point six buildings

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.660 
hundred and fifteen point six buildings
so<00:02:51.570> you're<00:02:51.840> simply<00:02:52.050> going<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.470> add<00:02:52.670> these

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
so you're simply going to add these

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.100 
so you're simply going to add these
seven<00:02:54.090> sites<00:02:55.250> together<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:57.870> you

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
seven sites together so then you

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.820 
seven sites together so then you
calculate<00:02:58.790> body<00:02:59.790> density

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:14.150 

you<00:03:06.370> are<00:03:06.490> just<00:03:06.730> going<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.150> plug<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.890> 100<00:03:09.630> 15.6

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.980 

into<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:17.140> long<00:03:17.620> previous<00:03:18.370> equation<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.660> we're

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
into the long previous equation so we're

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.860 
into the long previous equation so we're
going<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.200> go<00:03:20.320> at<00:03:20.820> 1.09<00:03:21.820> 7<00:03:23.100> minus<00:03:24.480> point<00:03:25.480> zero

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
going to go at 1.09 7 minus point zero

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.000 
going to go at 1.09 7 minus point zero
