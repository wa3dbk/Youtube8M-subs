well<00:00:03.989> now<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.170> we've<00:00:05.599> made<00:00:06.599> rabbits<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
well now that we've made rabbits and

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.700 
well now that we've made rabbits and
cross<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.910> grain<00:00:09.120> Gators<00:00:09.840> across<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.469> grain

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
cross the grain Gators across the grain

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.040 
cross the grain Gators across the grain
and<00:00:11.010> rabbits<00:00:11.430> with<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> grain<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.360> grooves

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
and rabbits with the grain and grooves

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.580 
and rabbits with the grain and grooves
along<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> grain<00:00:13.890> I<00:00:14.750> want<00:00:15.750> sure<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
along the grain I want sure just just a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
along the grain I want sure just just a
little<00:00:16.830> variation<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.400> how<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.029> these

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
little variation on how we can do these

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.739 
little variation on how we can do these
things<00:00:18.349> just<00:00:19.349> just<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.099> kind<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.749> suggestion

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:21.749 
things just just as kind of a suggestion

things just just as kind of a suggestion
we're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.169> to<00:00:22.259> be<00:00:22.380> doing<00:00:22.499> some<00:00:22.829> projects

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we're going to be doing some projects

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.489 
we're going to be doing some projects
later<00:00:23.489> on<00:00:23.730> where<00:00:24.539> we're<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.109> using<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
later on where we're going to be using a

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.220 
later on where we're going to be using a
lot<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.800> rabbits<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.609> dedos<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.509> grooves<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
lot of rabbits and dedos and grooves and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.269 
lot of rabbits and dedos and grooves and
that<00:00:28.829> sort<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.189> thing<00:00:29.249> and<00:00:30.769> my<00:00:31.769> interest<00:00:32.220> has

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that sort of thing and my interest has

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.389 
that sort of thing and my interest has
been<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> start<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.219> I've<00:00:35.309> been

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
been to to get you to start so I've been

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.189 
been to to get you to start so I've been
talking<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:35.730> using<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.480> simplest<00:00:37.019> of

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
talking about using the very simplest of

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.869 
talking about using the very simplest of
tools<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.399> show<00:00:38.519> you<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.699> couple

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
tools I just want to show you a couple

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.209 
tools I just want to show you a couple
of<00:00:39.059> things<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:40.199> speed<00:00:40.620> things<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of things that can can speed things up a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
of things that can can speed things up a
little<00:00:41.399> bit<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.750> help<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.379> uniformity

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
little bit and and help with uniformity

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.610 
little bit and and help with uniformity
in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.429> work<00:00:44.640> they're<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.539> necessary<00:00:46.379> but

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
in the work they're not necessary but

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.189 
in the work they're not necessary but
they're<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:46.980> nice<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.519> have<00:00:48.109> for<00:00:49.109> instance

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
they're really nice to have for instance

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.220 
they're really nice to have for instance
I<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:50.609> made<00:00:51.480> another<00:00:52.070> dingo<00:00:53.329> same<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.539> knife

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I just made another dingo same way knife

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
I just made another dingo same way knife
it<00:00:55.469> saw<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.210> chip<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.749> chisel<00:00:59.149> so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it saw it chip it up with the chisel so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.759 
it saw it chip it up with the chisel so
I<00:01:00.179> haven't<00:01:00.600> tried<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:01.140> take<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.409> right<00:01:01.710> down

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
I haven't tried to take it right down

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.100 
I haven't tried to take it right down
nice<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.579> neat<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.149> clean<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> chisel

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
nice and neat and clean with the chisel

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.400 
nice and neat and clean with the chisel
and<00:01:04.489> level<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.210> there's<00:01:07.140> there's

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
and level you know there's there's

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.570 
and level you know there's there's
another<00:01:07.710> tool<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.270> us

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
another tool that can do that for us

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.320 
another tool that can do that for us
here's<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:11.730> example<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.580> our

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
here's an example here this is our

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.280 
here's an example here this is our
router<00:01:16.490> yeah<00:01:17.540> where's<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.690> engine<00:01:19.050> where's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
router yeah where's the engine where's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.290 
router yeah where's the engine where's
the<00:01:19.470> motor<00:01:19.680> where's<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> plug<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
the motor where's the plug in right I

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.510 
the motor where's the plug in right I
know<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.810> you're<00:01:21.960> thinking<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
know what you're thinking but this is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.540 
know what you're thinking but this is
the<00:01:23.670> original<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.920> call<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.190> brother

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
the original kind of we call a brother

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.100 
the original kind of we call a brother
playing<00:01:26.940> sound<00:01:27.300> but<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.540> were<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.810> called

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
playing sound but they were just called

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.490 
playing sound but they were just called
rotors<00:01:29.570> basically<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.930> blade<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:33.500> could

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
rotors basically it's a blade that could

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.270 
rotors basically it's a blade that could
be<00:01:34.620> set<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> certain<00:01:35.430> distance<00:01:35.760> below<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
be set at a certain distance below this

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680 
be set at a certain distance below this
working<00:01:38.280> surface<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> adjustable<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.940> couple

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
working surface it's adjustable a couple

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.070 
working surface it's adjustable a couple
of<00:01:42.750> handles<00:01:43.230> what<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.460> means<00:01:44.760> is<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.390> set

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
of handles what this means is we can set

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.610 
of handles what this means is we can set
the<00:01:46.260> cutter<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> depth<00:01:48.120> we<00:01:48.420> want<00:01:48.660> our<00:01:48.960> data

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
the cutter to the depth we want our data

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.370 
the cutter to the depth we want our data
to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.130> chip<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.300> doesn't<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.230> to<00:01:52.290> be

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to be chip it out doesn't have to be

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.040 
to be chip it out doesn't have to be
tear<00:01:52.710> terribly<00:01:53.130> meet<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:54.360> set<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.840> right

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
tear terribly meet you set that right

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:06.319 
tear terribly meet you set that right
into<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> dado<00:01:55.940> just<00:01:56.940> backwards

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.130 

they're<00:02:08.340> perfectly<00:02:09.340> flat<00:02:09.780> perfectly<00:02:10.780> level

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
they're perfectly flat perfectly level

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.240 
they're perfectly flat perfectly level
to<00:02:11.170> an<00:02:11.860> exact<00:02:12.340> depth<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.810> want<00:02:17.129> if<00:02:18.129> you're

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
to an exact depth that we want if you're

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.589 
to an exact depth that we want if you're
doing<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.580> lot<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.819> them<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.239> see<00:02:19.450> where

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
doing a lot of them you can see where

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.309 
doing a lot of them you can see where
that<00:02:19.629> saves<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> lot<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.440> time<00:02:20.560> how<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:23.140> is

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
that saves you a lot of time how this is

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.830 
that saves you a lot of time how this is
an<00:02:23.440> old<00:02:23.620> Stanley<00:02:23.950> number<00:02:24.370> 71<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.569> find

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
an old Stanley number 71 you can find

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.020 
an old Stanley number 71 you can find
them<00:02:25.989> they're<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.319> very<00:02:26.560> expensive<00:02:27.030> there

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
them they're not very expensive there

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.140 
them they're not very expensive there
are<00:02:28.180> modern<00:02:28.660> enough<00:02:29.010> replicas<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.340> some<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
are modern enough replicas and some of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.949 
are modern enough replicas and some of
them<00:02:31.299> are<00:02:31.360> better<00:02:31.569> than<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> original

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959

number of others is a stanley 45 these
aren't<00:03:43.389> made<00:03:43.599> anymore<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:45.519> Stanley<00:03:45.910> made

aren't made anymore but Stanley made

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.569 
aren't made anymore but Stanley made
them<00:03:46.299> for<00:03:46.480> many<00:03:46.599> decades<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:48.099> can<00:03:48.280> see<00:03:48.400> they

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
them for many decades you can see they

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.849 
them for many decades you can see they
they<00:03:49.000> belong<00:03:49.359> in<00:03:49.569> a<00:03:49.630> family<00:03:50.079> this<00:03:50.109> is<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.680> age

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
they belong in a family this is the age

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.960 
they belong in a family this is the age
of<00:03:51.069> cast<00:03:52.060> iron<00:03:52.329> right<00:03:53.099> light<00:03:54.099> back<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.579> top<00:03:54.760> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
of cast iron right light back to top and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.460 
of cast iron right light back to top and
basically<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.900> has<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.139> fence<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:57.040> can<00:03:57.250> be<00:03:57.340> set

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
basically it has a fence that can be set

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.099 
basically it has a fence that can be set
cutter<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.269> fence<00:04:01.269> can<00:04:01.480> run<00:04:01.660> along<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
cutter and the fence can run along the

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.059 
cutter and the fence can run along the
edge

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.920 

you<00:04:08.069> can<00:04:08.220> see<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.700> starts<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:09.239> cut<00:04:09.480> a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
you can see that it starts the cut a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.160 
you can see that it starts the cut a
groove<00:04:10.079> that's<00:04:10.860> always<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:12.420> same<00:04:12.689> distance

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
groove that's always the same distance

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.900 
groove that's always the same distance
from<00:04:13.319> an<00:04:13.500> edge<00:04:15.109> there's<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.229> def<00:04:16.470> stop<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:17.699> will

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
from an edge there's a def stop it will

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.819 
from an edge there's a def stop it will
cut<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> groove<00:04:18.389> just<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.139> far<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.680> no

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
cut the groove just so far and no

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.290 
cut the groove just so far and no
farther<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:21.830> speeds<00:04:22.830> things<00:04:23.009> up<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.639> just

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
farther that speeds things up I just

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.710 
farther that speeds things up I just
wanted<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> show<00:04:25.020> those<00:04:25.199> to<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.530> now<00:04:26.720> because

can afford it if you can come across

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.740 
can afford it if you can come across
them<00:04:42.930> inexpensively<00:04:43.729> they<00:04:44.729> are<00:04:44.789> very<00:04:44.910> useful
