the end I kind of messed that up so yeah
nothing<00:00:35.219> too<00:00:35.370> crazy<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:36.120> too<00:00:36.300> hard

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.150 

maybe<00:00:40.710> maybe<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> faster<00:00:42.510> combos<00:00:43.160> but

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
maybe maybe one of the faster combos but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.900 
maybe maybe one of the faster combos but
uh<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.820> go<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> next<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.910> hold

square twice or tap square twice hold
square<00:00:53.160> twice<00:00:53.430> it'll<00:00:53.940> combo<00:00:54.300> into<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
square twice it'll combo into the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.029 
square twice it'll combo into the
haymaker<00:01:00.020> seems<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> big<00:01:01.620> numbers

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
haymaker seems like a lot of big numbers

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
haymaker seems like a lot of big numbers
or<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.969> lot<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> numbers<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> middle

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

or a lot of numbers there in the middle
and<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> big<00:01:04.739> number<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> end

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and then a big number there at the end

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.630 
and then a big number there at the end

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
let's see yeah so not too bad I don't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.160 
let's see yeah so not too bad I don't
mind<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.909> move<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:16.110> combo<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.250> honest

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
mind this move this combo to be honest

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.730

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
we'll go from the hand blasters into the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490 
we'll go from the hand blasters into the
bow<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.330> hold<00:01:27.930> triangle

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

bow now this one is just hold triangle
tab<00:01:28.710> triangle<00:01:29.130> whole<00:01:29.280> triangle

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:47.390 

um<00:01:40.010> let's<00:01:41.010> see<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:45.619> don't<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.830> like<00:01:47.130> that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
um let's see I don't really like that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.530 
um let's see I don't really like that
move<00:01:48.240> too<00:01:48.900> much<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.680> honest<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:51.270> looks<00:01:51.330> like

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
move too much to be honest it looks like

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.730 
move too much to be honest it looks like
it<00:01:51.660> hits<00:01:51.810> pretty<00:01:52.050> big<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.440> end<00:01:52.470> right

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it hits pretty big at the end right

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.330 
it hits pretty big at the end right
there<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.680> I'm<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.920> big<00:01:56.100> bow

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
think I actually used the other one in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.230 
think I actually used the other one in
the<00:02:05.040> middle<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.430> somewhere<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.880> may<00:02:06.150> have

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the middle there somewhere you may have

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.229 
the middle there somewhere you may have
seen<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.020> uh<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.590> hold<00:02:08.399> triangle<00:02:09.030> three

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
seen it it's uh just hold triangle three

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:23.160 
seen it it's uh just hold triangle three
times<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:13.820> yeah<00:02:14.820> there<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.690> it
