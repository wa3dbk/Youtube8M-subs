00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
forehead and all the way down it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
forehead and all the way down it's
incorrect<00:01:52.950> t-zone<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.970> only<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> center

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
incorrect t-zone is only in the center

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
incorrect t-zone is only in the center
of<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.020> face<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.439> these<00:01:56.219> little<00:01:56.549> dots<00:01:56.759> right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of your face so these little dots right

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.330 
of your face so these little dots right
here<00:01:57.329> these<00:01:57.509> are<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.840> pores<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
here these are your pores and the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
here these are your pores and the
highlighted<00:01:59.880> area<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.840> your<00:02:00.990> t-zone

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
highlighted area is actually your t-zone

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.889 
highlighted area is actually your t-zone
so<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.310> little<00:02:02.700> tiny<00:02:03.090> round

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so it's just like a little tiny round

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.550 
so it's just like a little tiny round
bubble<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> center<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.070> your

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
bubble of the center of your

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.710 
bubble of the center of your
forehead<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:06.820> all<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.149> way<00:02:07.240> down<00:02:07.479> your

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
forehead going all the way down your

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
nose and all the way to your chin so it

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.430 
nose and all the way to your chin so it
kind<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.929> makes<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.650> tea<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:13.230> calling<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.319> your

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
kind of makes a tea for calling it your

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.320 
kind of makes a tea for calling it your
teaser<00:02:14.650> earning<00:02:15.160> on<00:02:15.310> how<00:02:15.489> large<00:02:15.730> your<00:02:16.030> pores

are in your t-zone can determine your
skin<00:02:19.209> types<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.500> smaller<00:02:20.920> pores

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
skin types so if you have smaller pores

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.370 
skin types so if you have smaller pores
you're<00:02:22.060> going<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.480> towards<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> dry<00:02:23.110> side

you're going to be towards the dry side

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.229 
you're going to be towards the dry side
if<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:23.980> larger<00:02:24.489> pores<00:02:24.790> you're<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.180> to

if you have larger pores you're going to

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.839 
if you have larger pores you're going to
be<00:02:25.390> more<00:02:25.569> oily<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.800> we're<00:02:27.250> gonna<00:02:27.340> find<00:02:27.670> out

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
be more oily so we're gonna find out

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.400 
be more oily so we're gonna find out
what<00:02:27.880> skin<00:02:28.239> type<00:02:28.269> you<00:02:28.630> are<00:02:28.660> today<00:02:29.170> for

can be considered a skin tight but it's

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.890 
can be considered a skin tight but it's
actually<00:02:38.470> not<00:02:38.980> it's<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.459> condition<00:02:39.640> also<00:02:40.239> if

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
actually not it's a condition also if

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.990 
actually not it's a condition also if
you<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.110> acne<00:02:41.350> skin<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.340> considered<00:02:42.880> a

you have acne skin that's considered a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.580 
you have acne skin that's considered a
disorder<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.940> dry<00:02:46.239> skin<00:02:46.630> you're<00:02:47.290> most

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
disorder have dry skin you're most

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620 
disorder have dry skin you're most
likely<00:02:47.890> not<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.580> produce<00:02:48.760> enough<00:02:49.360> oil

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
likely not going to produce enough oil

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.350 
likely not going to produce enough oil
so<00:02:50.410> your<00:02:50.799> pores<00:02:51.099> are<00:02:51.430> going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.849> be<00:02:51.970> really

really small and you can barely see them
in<00:02:54.760> your<00:02:54.940> t-zone<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.799> means<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.580> have

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790

tend to be sensitive because of the acid
mantle<00:03:10.329> lacks<00:03:11.019> oil<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.100> products<00:03:12.609> that
