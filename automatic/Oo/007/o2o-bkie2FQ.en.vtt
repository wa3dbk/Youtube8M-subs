sides and the way it's played is so

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.020 
sides and the way it's played is so
difficult<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.750> after<00:00:13.170> 36<00:00:14.130> years<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.790> flute

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
difficult that after 36 years of flute

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
difficult that after 36 years of flute
making<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.630> still<00:00:16.109> can't<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.710> it

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
making I still can't do it

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.910 
making I still can't do it
so<00:00:17.880> here's<00:00:18.180> Eric<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> flute<00:00:19.020> maker<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.590> being

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
so here's Eric the flute maker not being

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
so here's Eric the flute maker not being
able<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.130> play<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> flute<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.480> said<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
able to play a flute and said that you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.939 
able to play a flute and said that you
have<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> whistle

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
have to whistle

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:35.299 
have to whistle
consider<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.150> whistling<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:35.130> make<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
consider your whistling so to make a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
consider your whistling so to make a
long<00:00:35.550> story<00:00:35.670> short<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.320> can't<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
long story short if I can't do it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
long story short if I can't do it
I<00:00:38.100> presume<00:00:38.700> maybe<00:00:39.059> most<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.750> can't<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
I presume maybe most of you can't do it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.270 
I presume maybe most of you can't do it
thus<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.820> created<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.710> Egyptian

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
thus we have created here the Egyptian

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.540 
thus we have created here the Egyptian
flute<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:46.469> western<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.309> blowing

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
flute in the western way of blowing

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.319 
flute in the western way of blowing
sideways<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.100> smile<00:00:50.520> spit<00:00:51.000> watermelon

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sideways so you smile spit watermelon

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.069 
sideways so you smile spit watermelon
seeds<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.120> roll<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.850> and

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
seeds you can roll it about a bit and

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
seeds you can roll it about a bit and
what<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.230> found<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.920> whole<00:00:59.190> structure

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
what we found out in the whole structure

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
what we found out in the whole structure
is<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.690> didn't<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.320> any

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is that one of them didn't make any

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
is that one of them didn't make any
sense<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.309> Western<00:01:02.699> mind<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.480> threw

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
sense to the Western mind so we threw

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.140 
sense to the Western mind so we threw
that<00:01:03.809> hole<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.199> thus<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.220> left<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.790> four

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that hole out thus we are left with four

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.260 
that hole out thus we are left with four
on<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.330> top<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
on the top and one in the back and here

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.050 
on the top and one in the back and here
is<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> sound<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:11.040> modified<00:01:11.520> Egyptian
