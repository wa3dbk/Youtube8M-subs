 favorite 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.840
 cosmic cowboy group right away

 cosmojazz chamonix season 6 moriarty 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.710
 ware 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.610
 the beautiful magical setting the frame is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.050
 magic it's magic like everything 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.450
 magical and natural natural 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.060
 supernatural mature it is indescribable 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.650
 this demo mode it would be too sad 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.240
 we are not disappointed with the trip 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.590
 will come back thanks to moriarty 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.590
 yeah thanks to the cosmojazz 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.619
 I am with rosemary and arthur me 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 it's one of the most beautiful concerts in fact 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 I will tell you the truth this festival 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.049
 I believe that to organize only for 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.610
 that moment that is to say that they put 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.259
 six years to come here but I find 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.909
 it's a bit long even if I am 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.380
 very angry rose-marie why you have 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.899
 put six years to come here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 why why why I do not know 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.799
 we really were really stupid 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.869
 a mom because after this experience 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.289
 these chestnuts I hope we will see the year 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.640
 next but I think we were scared 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.200
 to get on foot but as you tell us 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.349
 drove up because we 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.349
 see well 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.870
 the experience of playing like that in full 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 you know it but that's it 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.690
 this kind of woodstock in the mountains 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.240
 is that why you 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.880
 to be tight next to each other where 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.970
 you feel a little bit in a cocoon at 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.830
 this immensity that will scare you into 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.000
 do we are always a little tightened 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.550
 on each other even on big 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.550
 euro festival scenes because we have 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.620
 started in acoustics we did a lot 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.510
 in concert with a single microphone and that's 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.640
 true that being very close helping the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.630
 others it helps to get along already 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.540
 also is to have a form of fusion 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.540
 between us of organic energy 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.990
 between us one is one is glued tight 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.970
 like that and it's good for music 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.160
 voice I'd love to play with you for 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.290
 to be a little stuck tight with you but 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.060
 beyond this solidarity that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.440
 finally see what 's been 16 years 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.890
 you are together rose marie how a 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.330
 group can hold for 16 years and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.460
 get along as well how do we hold 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.070
 there we fight a lot huh that's 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.480
 dirty this is the secret we are arguing 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.010
 but we hold with collaborations 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.350
 have done a lot of collaborations 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.850
 meeting of artists from around the world 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.950
 brings oxygen and then 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.360
 experiences like this here if we 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.190
 was just in the routine every 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.990
 days the concert in the rock room 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.880
 there it is sure that we would not hold 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.250
 besides, it's unmissable after 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.350
 ten fifteen dates in in this kind of 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.730
 to leave that there we do not actually 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.950
 it's a bit like running 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.740
 from a couple to 6 you do not want a 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.840
 pianist non forgiveness to art so that makes 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.610
 there oh well listen, we talked about oxygen 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.270
 I think you filled it up 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.040
 oxygen 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.739
 you left for at least six months 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:20.090
 quiet without scenes of non households 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:23.390
 it's possible thanks a lot to the paris 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.390
 thank you arthur
