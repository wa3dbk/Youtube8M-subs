00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.750
 Use the conjunction rule in the plural to write 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.800
 Phrase 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.700
 We have (77 + 2) +3 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.680
 in another way 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.860
 Simplify both expressions to prove 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.710
 They have the same output 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.230
 It seems to us that the law of interdependence is in combination 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 Too complicated, it means you can 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.670
 Link these three numbers in different ways or you can 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 Gather them in a different order 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 Let me make it clear 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.920
 The way the issue was written, (77 + 2) 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.090
 And then wrote +3 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.530
 The statement in brackets indicates that it counts 77 + 2 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 Before combining with the 3 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 If we want to evaluate this, we will evaluate 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.930
 Between the brackets first, we say, well 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 77 + 2 = 79, if between the brackets 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.730
 Worth 79 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.050
 Our 3 stays 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.430
 79 + 3 = 82, if output 82 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.690
 This is if we value it in the same order 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.570
 Which he gave us 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.190
 Now, the law of interdependence says in the plural it 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.080
 It does not matter if we collect 77 + 2 first or we collect 2+ 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.860
 3 First, we can link phrases differently anyway 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.590
 If this does the same thing 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.250
 Same thing as, we can 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.610
 Write it this way 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.520
 Let me write all the numbers 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.765
 77 + 2 + 3 

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.090
 If we do not have arcs here, it actually is 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 The same thing here, because 77 + 2 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.430
 = 79 + 3 = 82 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.510
 But do you know what is the law of interdependence? 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.380
 I can type it as 77 + 2 + 3 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.430
 I can gather this first and then add 77 to the output, and this 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.970
 It will be the same in case you collect these two 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.790
 The first two numbers are then added 3 to the output 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 Let us prove this to ourselves 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.240
 2 + 3 = 5, and 77 + 5 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.130
 77 + 5 = 82 again 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.840
 If it does not matter how the thread is setup 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.570
 In all cases we will get 82 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.729
 This is the law of interdependence in combination
