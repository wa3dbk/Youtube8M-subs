00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:20.699
 There it is, I'm from the band on man and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.500
 band homage to belo horizonte and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 I was called here by the staff of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.830
 stomp to take to test the new pedal 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.059
 that is coming out of them now that is the cash 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.649
 and what china is a dynamic overdrive 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.930
 good for those who do not know that vertrek 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.660
 dynamic, we'll talk a little bit 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 about it during the course of the test 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 Come on, I'm using a fender. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 mexican telecaster unifying pedroni 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.270
 and the clean guitar sound is basically 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.270
 that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.440
 to force the pedal here with a good drive 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.390
 low can you feel a 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:22.590
 saturation as if it were a saturation of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 valves then beauty for those who 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.899
 they do not know what a dynamic truth is 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.850
 I'm going to go up a little drive here. 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.679
 for you to feel the great thing in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 dynamic truth is that he feels very 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.020
 tight you give then if you touch 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.910
 weak it will distort - the signal and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:48.360
 you play harder it distorts more 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:51.770
 let's see in practice is there you can 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.770
 use for several things for example 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.900
 the bomb had a little pole of it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:18.170
 for us to feel it closed 01 soma 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.170
 more filtered passes something more serious 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 it is important to note that even when 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 the filter is pulled harder 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.130
 you do not have too many acute losses 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.240
 so the sign of what is is not much 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.860
 committed 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.510
 now we will prodrive the pedal max 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.100
 for us to feel it is almost as if 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.100
 it was a fine kantzow distortion 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.220
 well this is well and even with a high drive 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.260
 people can have a dynamic 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.260
 controlled by the volume of guitar 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.360
 still manage to get clean and 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.530
 As we grow older, we will 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.530
 arriving at the fans 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.890
 good is this 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.890
 I'm thank you so much, stop, get out of here.
