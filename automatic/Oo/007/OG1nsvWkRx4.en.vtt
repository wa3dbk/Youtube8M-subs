 "Tombs" (sweeping the grave) Music: たまぁ~ず sweeping the tomb: Mirror sound company (act2) Piano: Kongmu 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.540
 ...heard the sound of swearing. 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.190
 In front of me 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.510
 There is a big rock standing there 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 That meaning 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.820
 I am not sure 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.130
 But still put my hand together 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.120
 (summer) 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.770
 Get up early 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.090
 Go out with your family 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740
 "Where are you going?" 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.400
 "mom" 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.710
 We went to the field path 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.990
 I want to wait here 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.650
 so boring 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.960
 "Let's go back soon? Dad." 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 I understand later 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.590
 The mother who said that showed a lonely expression 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.880
 Clear sky, rising white smoke 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.530
 I don’t really like this way. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.270
 Sad things like me make me sad 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.510
 Autumn has come 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 Crossing the winter 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.470
 Spring past 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.480
 It’s summer again. 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 Repeat 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.790
 years 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.100
 The meaning of words will continue 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.010
 I am in love 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.670
 "Grandpa, can you hear?" 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.980
 "I have a lovely person." 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.640
 "You have a good grandson!" 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.290
 "Grandma, can you hear it?" 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.610
 "I gave birth to a lovely child!" 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.260
 It’s summer again. 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.920
 It’s time to sweep the grave. 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.230
 We drove back to our hometown 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.890
 In the nostalgic 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.540
 that place 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.000
 I will join hands with my children. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
