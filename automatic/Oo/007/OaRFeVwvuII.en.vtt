so<00:00:20.080> we<00:00:20.650> teach<00:00:21.130> them<00:00:21.550> how<00:00:21.850> to<00:00:22.269> do<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.869> scales<00:00:23.289> so

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
so we teach them how to do the scales so

wonderful thing the 4th finger plays

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.770 
wonderful thing the 4th finger plays
only<00:01:41.290> one<00:01:41.620> time<00:01:42.070> in<00:01:42.100> each<00:01:42.790> octave<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.720> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
only one time in each octave of the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.950 
only one time in each octave of the
scale<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:45.430> we<00:01:45.820> repeat<00:01:46.240> one<00:01:46.450> two<00:01:46.630> three

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
scale because we repeat one two three

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.020 
scale because we repeat one two three
and<00:01:47.200> then<00:01:47.470> one<00:01:47.680> two<00:01:47.830> three<00:01:48.040> four<00:01:48.310> every<00:01:48.760> scale

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
and then one two three four every scale

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.850 
and then one two three four every scale
is<00:01:49.240> composed<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.840> those<00:01:49.960> two<00:01:50.229> groups<00:01:50.409> it's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
is composed of those two groups it's

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.190 
is composed of those two groups it's
just<00:01:51.280> like<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> telephone<00:01:52.120> number<00:01:52.330> seven

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
just like a telephone number seven

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just like a telephone number seven
digits<00:01:53.670> three<00:01:54.670> plus<00:01:55.270> four<00:01:55.620> so<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.920> fourth

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
digits three plus four so the fourth

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.390 
digits three plus four so the fourth
finger<00:01:57.549> appears<00:01:58.299> only<00:01:58.510> one<00:01:59.229> time<00:01:59.620> so<00:01:59.950> if<00:02:00.190> you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
finger appears only one time so if you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.230 
finger appears only one time so if you
know<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.290> fourth<00:02:02.650> finger<00:02:03.280> note<00:02:03.549> is<00:02:03.970> for

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
know what the fourth finger note is for

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.789 
know what the fourth finger note is for
each<00:02:04.450> scale<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.229> course<00:02:05.440> it's<00:02:05.590> different

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
each scale and of course it's different

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.480 
each scale and of course it's different
for<00:02:06.130> each<00:02:06.250> scale<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.810> when<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.679> come<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.459> a

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
for each scale then when you come to a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.010 
for each scale then when you come to a
finger<00:02:10.060> crossing<00:02:10.450> either<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.650> thumb<00:02:12.069> under

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
learning how to finger the scales then

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.000 
learning how to finger the scales then
we<00:03:00.570> would<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:00.900> them<00:03:01.110> write<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.500> scale<00:03:01.770> on

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
we would have them write the scale on

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.710 
we would have them write the scale on
the<00:03:02.160> keyboard<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:02.880> another<00:03:03.360> little

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
the keyboard that's another little

the keyboard that's another little
visual<00:03:04.170> aid<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.710> them<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:06.150> have

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
visual aid for them and then we have

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.180 
visual aid for them and then we have
them<00:03:06.480> write<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.050> out<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.590> manuscript

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
them write it out on the manuscript

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.100 
them write it out on the manuscript
paper<00:03:08.370> one<00:03:09.120> octave<00:03:09.540> ascending<00:03:09.960> and

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
multi multiple copies of this or we say

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.470 
multi multiple copies of this or we say
to<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> parents<00:03:44.730> who<00:03:44.760> make<00:03:44.940> multiple<00:03:45.450> copies

the minors and we keep tell you how to
to<00:03:53.190> derive<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.630> minor<00:03:55.410> scales<00:03:55.860> as<00:03:56.160> well<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.590> to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
to derive the minor scales as well so to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.070 
to derive the minor scales as well so to
go<00:03:58.740> back<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.280> site<00:03:59.490> in<00:03:59.820> charge<00:04:00.150> after<00:04:00.600> they

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
go back to the site in charge after they

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.620 
go back to the site in charge after they
have<00:04:01.320> done<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:02.250> scale<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.820> understand<00:04:03.300> what

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
have done the scale I understand what

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.390 
have done the scale I understand what
that<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:04.080> then<00:04:05.690> we<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.720> one<00:04:07.290> circle<00:04:07.740> all<00:04:07.950> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
that is then we have one circle all the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.590 
that is then we have one circle all the
black<00:04:08.640> key<00:04:09.390> notes<00:04:10.370> put<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> slash<00:04:11.880> through<00:04:12.300> the

they see it they're gonna play it always

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.150 
they see it they're gonna play it always
