00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.319
 Hello, you Zafira is not just a tiny mini 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.049
 Video what's going on for five minutes 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 that's sort of the biker answer to the last video where i got around these guys 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.619
 there do 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.800
 and while I have got to establish a few and have got in my ostrach 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 following news found into the o2 fun 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.760
 she paints the history contract 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.090
 it takes the air to fly it makes my team the match 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.090
 for e-mail blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.230
 As said before, more people have been developed to get spoken UKE 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.390
 I show nothing to do with money 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.760
 that's about 2 percent 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.020
 Erich knows me in the end in the corner and the little luck strings do everything 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020
 a in the branches KlÃ¶dens 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.239
 and year 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.160
 i got the ewk i believe in four minutes 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.530
 around him and in the depths of the sea 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 This has the Social Court challenge 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.790
 Percent 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.090
 Pound yes I have the thing 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240
 after entries gameplay or something 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.310
 get here 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.620
 Unfortunately, there was a lot of change as in the last video but 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.370
 I hope that bothers the snow so Barthel and the hard drive 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.120
 I'll never say exactly 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.360
 Percent of what should gamble away I like that quite well 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.770
 the ACEA I have lifted something moving which I am not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.040
 bad 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 all other weapons men 1 or how that thing is I like quite a bit 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.100
 five years 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.540
 but that goes back to 35 back 3 out 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.900
 Who now wonders why I sometimes end up fifth 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.290
 and wait 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.370
 that's belief in the place to see very well that's because 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.800
 the team had to 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.980
 my heart also has dad and percent of these people is in Modern Warfare 2 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.760
 pretty cool 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.230
 and I was always where the opponents came from 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.010
 that's why it's never so profiled 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.759
 Prof problematic problematic if you play the defensive 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.149
 Percent the neo went 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:14.679
 to get 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.950
 and I'll give you a few little things that will make me feel closer to life 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.559
 a meet the allegations fall 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:25.919
 So I clearly find advantages of online now that probably the weapon selection 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.759
 Bubbles downside for me is it's the seventh win to create another 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.589
 Strikes build on each other 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.939
 and that is somehow marriage 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.599
 si bit wrong 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.950
 what really cool jersey of Trie rer really cool if 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.419
 if something like that would be considered compatible with those Probst 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.769
 because Don Stumpp it is difficult to play is not bad so I have 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.079
 now meanwhile Main 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.939
 fallen a finding what we do not like so much is that 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.689
 m comparisons to blackouts 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.389
 The weapons so if I now more Sepp appeared but then in the hand 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.919
 I'm still in a good mood and it just works 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.870
 Percent of the cost sound 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.420
 that's all pretty much percent countries would ear 4 and ears and the deficits 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.949
 you will 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.119
 partially 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.209
 Elke Kiltz year 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.459
 No all this promo Hungary in the right way war 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.079
 it is also no disadvantage to read it and be Holger Glandorf 7 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.079
 then midfield - because Nina is so good the steps so 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:35.619
 Jahr und Lektor Time what I like yours it just keeps percent of Kitzinger 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.399
 Weapons barrier to the possibilities 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:43.369
 to watch or to play something different captures the natural 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:48.559
 To be honest, Black Ops is living the Tier 12 over the top 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.159
 I have to take this because I too 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.669
 blackouts 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.669
 exactly the same with year cashier sits created 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.619
 but it is more that is 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.559
 we like the sun 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:07.509
 where you can be team on NBCU my all here you need more skill old 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.489
 Black Ops I think so who in Black Ops you can tell more 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:17.459
 whoever with the weapon or a middle aim al-wazir in Minden too 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.590
 so for me is my personal opinion 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.550
 yes of course the people who say that yes I have no idea but then have 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.009
 I think Kainer good 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.319
 I am that it is not easy 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.629
 with Qt kg just ask a joke than in black box so I have now 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.379
 started lousy parts 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.069
 clear now with kg happy 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.379
 where comma 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.379
 10 or so without playing on kg now 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.550
 but every market from the percent 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.580
 to both teams keep what he wants 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.189
 ND three coming out I'm looking forward to it 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.189
 will certainly give back things that upset him but 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.229
 Verdascos shine again 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.389
 It's good looking
