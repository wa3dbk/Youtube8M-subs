00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.720
 This car was introduced 2002 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.879
 year and became the third SUV 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.309
 volkswagen in the history of the 2006 model 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.570
 Received a small update in 2010 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.570
 a completely new generation has come out 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.840
 this is the new 2014 volkswagen touran 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 the freshest and it is attractive and the rack 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 that it is not able to spoil even 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.690
 blue is the main changes 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.460
 some water changed bumper optics 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.170
 new rear diffuser fog 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.479
 Apeksimova now even in the database 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.930
 but the most important difference lies right 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.940
 in plain view from the front 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.110
 before restyling, we were 2 here 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.880
 chrome stripes 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.229
 And in their new four and this all changes 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.210
 the second most important change is not so much 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.640
 noticeably but she has a car became 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.619
 a little shorter by 2 millimeters 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.880
 changed the shape of some elements but 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.130
 only masters will notice this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.840
 pre-restyled version is attentive 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.240
 for example, there were separate buttons 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 control heated steering and frontal 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.310
 glass 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 well and of course it is necessary to note 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.810
 the highlight is now white instead 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.890
 red and my eyes are frankly 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 thank designers thank you well and so 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.210
 the car looks more solid and he's on 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 really solid specifically this 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.099
 equipment would cost you almost the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.260
 4 thousand dollars very pleased 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.420
 media support google maps 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.280
 the truth so far they are not there but they promise soon 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
 adaptive cruise control got better 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.879
 now you can even drive 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.680
 megalopolis generally forget about the pedals 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.540
 the car itself will accelerate and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.030
 slow down here to stop before 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 in front of the 7th golf course roamed 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.569
 emergency braking system after an accident 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 to prevent subsequent 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.010
 collision more so if control 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.510
 over auto lost windows automatically 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.250
 rise and straps tighten 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.080
 restyled model refreshed line 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.349
 engines power three liter 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.840
 turbodiesel v6 grew to 262 horse 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.459
 forces and consumption at the same time even fell to 6 6 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.190
 liters per hundred but it's in perfect 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.260
 conditions under very ideal minimum 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.620
 the value that I got 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.140
 see on the highway it's 72 liters to the mountains not 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.849
 It is worth counting on 9 liters at a very 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.530
 moderate everywhere in my time 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.170
 operation unfortunately consumption 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.269
 was 15 17 liters and only then 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.700
 because this car is real 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.799
 provocateur in him in some wondrous way 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.870
 feel like you can blink 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.560
 all the high beam right and left 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.239
 by the way yes 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.450
 optics is turning right behind 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.430
 a car and yet families with pennies 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.019
 seconds to a hundred it is very tempting 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.970
 especially when you are first on 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.069
 traffic light by the way to our market this 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.519
 the car will fall into the old 3-liter 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:34.470
 v6 rated at 245 horsepower instead 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.599
 two at 62 he and a torque of 550 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.870
 millimeters instead of five hundred and eighty 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.209
 well, it's very nice car very 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.389
 quiet right no complaints at all 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.670
 there is no engine sound at all 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.670
 similar to a field after all you are 6 but not 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.690
 the road is good for his goods but this one 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.549
 car behind the stove options for the most 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.190
 I do not want to go through the main ones 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.440
 examples if your hands are busy you can 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.280
 open the trunk just swipe 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.280
 under the bumper 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.049
 if you can upload something heavy 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.250
 adaptive suspension can be lowered to 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.250
 loading conditions 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.110
 Our equipment has advanced 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.970
 audio system one audio content 10 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.920
 speakers so now i decide myself 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.070
 what to listen to around me in traffic 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.930
 beautiful sound at 6 or news at 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.150
 the system has everything including two slots for 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.860
 sd card and hard disk count 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.380
 seat adjustment exceeds 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.780
 the number of muscles on the back and all the settings 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.180
 including steering and tilt mirrors 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.770
 can save in squat and camera radars 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.850
 separate climate control even for 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.360
 rear passengers 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.650
 a bunch of things still called taureg 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.570
 I have a language SUV 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.419
 turns and because he is so 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.270
 dear or I was asked just drove 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.690
 on different SUVs and this is different 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.690
 from them 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.889
 tau rex package terra antic not on 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.289
 pavement is an all-wheel drive system 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.909
 po-motion asymmetric locking 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.470
 differential torso ground clearance 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.539
 adjustable from eighteen to thirty 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.729
 centimeters down with 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.560
 ratio of 256 inter-axle lock 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.909
 differential locking rear 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.889
 cross-axle differential 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.740
 ford depth 60 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.500
 centimeters articulation 430 millimeters 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.060
 angle of entry 34 centimeters and exit 32 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.409
 longitudinal passability of 24 centimeters 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.389
 it is interesting that it is practically 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.219
 uncompromising car he has 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.719
 very few competitors capable 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.879
 contend with him off-road 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.830
 even the famous landrover defender and jeep 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.990
 wrangler are inferior then u fish in our 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.639
 configuration in many ways for example toureg 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.280
 take a ford 10 centimeters more 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.530
 than defender and on 12 than ringer even in 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.150
 track where 1 and 2 are stuck due to lumen 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.219
 under bridges taureg with thirty 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.810
 centimeters will be generally called 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.810
 Taureg some all-wheel drive 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.719
 pshikalka for the city ​​can only as 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.190
 it would be correct not to say auto blockhead and 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:10.069
 is it worth saying that mentioned 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.199
 SUVs are inferior wagons on the road here 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.150
 turned on the sport mode lowered the suspension and 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.279
 you go on the rails of course small 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.440
 there are shortcomings for example this is ridiculous 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:20.120
 gray insert on the front panel or 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.130
 display car from four cameras 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.469
 as though a plan view of which nothing 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.120
 understandable but it's all the little things taureg yet 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.779
 occupies a worthy place in his 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.130
 segment 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:30.289
 I think the reasons to change your 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.479
 dorestayling toureg but new little 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.039
 unless you bought your in the database and now 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.659
 want minced full time 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.430
 upgrade but for those who like 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.379
 ponders upgraded choice 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.690
 the model should be a good option to 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.870
 word base, it is as before 60000 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.870
 dollars 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:35.860
 we went with my body normal 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:40.690
 car for example if your hands are busy 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:52.840
 car can open example hands 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:58.060
 busy trunk can open no hands 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.400
 busy trunk can open for example 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:05.520
 if your hands are busy you can open the trunk 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.520
 just running your foot under the bumper
