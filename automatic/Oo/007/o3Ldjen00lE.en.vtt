00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.480

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.480
 channel are frames and with all of us 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:27.920
 you are seeing people focusing on everything 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.640
 well set and olive let's go 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.300
 here playing when the people puppies 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.730
 popcorn cocktails etc. and so on 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.239
 attending the guests could the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.920
 people born and well, well, I tell you 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.250
 with many familiar faces here in 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 principle unite shabelle at xxvi take on 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.140
 yes 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.640
 it's more until a lot of press we want 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.130
 know what it is that has prepared us 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.270
 later I'm going to focus a lot 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.270
 the screens will not be 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.250
 when a pendrive to the left of that 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.110
 runner that you see to the left 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.460
 is where the popcorn is talking 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.290
 cocktails and others 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.020
 this is already boiling over here because 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.020
 put is to test the game 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.580
 those people around here and then good with my 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.820
 hands but we will go there the bottom 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 well to see what the presentation is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.600
 that tell us about the game presents its 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.640
 lifetime 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 so nothing for my court and for the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 Moment more kisses hugs 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.080
 yarns you have found in the next 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.080
 video 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.320
 here we have david trying a bit the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 game 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.680
 I already asked that you could record the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.270
 market screen permission to wash 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.830
 which they were adapting to the whole world 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 so nothing we're going to give a little bit 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.070
 you see these first images a little bit 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.070
 of the game in movement 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.009
 and now is that graphically very cool 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.310
 David commented that maybe he is missing a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.380
 tad of speed to the character a bit 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.690
 of agility maybe but good too 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.690
 we are in the first phase of the game in 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.060
 the first constant moments and up 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.590
 what do you do with the controls you'll have 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.670
 a bit where you move and others but 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 good graphically you see 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.220
 well, well, fast, I like it 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.410
 It pretty much looks like a charter 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.200
 has an air and did not comment you see that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.300
 also a little roll tom tom raider 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.850
 so well here you are watching this 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.730
 the character appears on the screen as 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.730
 that is blurred you want to focus 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.819
 We arrived here in the middle of the forest 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.819
 for a walk 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.189
 in the menus insurance 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.690
 in america 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.400
 and as I said earlier we have the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.769
 wait to enter and try 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.599
 you can try if not waiting for what 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.770
 is the presentation and we are testing a 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.690
 bit the game you see that this is still 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.960
 the messages that you will find in your 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.960
 dishes 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.090
 by very crowded 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.319
 the player 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.940
 so nothing will keep telling you until 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940
 now
