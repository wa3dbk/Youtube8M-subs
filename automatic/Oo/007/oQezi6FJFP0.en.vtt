that's<00:00:04.440> not<00:00:04.620> gonna<00:00:04.770> stop<00:00:04.859> me<00:00:05.130> from<00:00:05.310> making<00:00:05.520> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
that's not gonna stop me from making a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.169 
that's not gonna stop me from making a
video<00:00:06.089> for<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.390> guys<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:07.379> basically<00:00:08.150> what<00:00:09.150> I

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
video for you guys so basically what I

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.049 
video for you guys so basically what I
built<00:00:09.420> today<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.559> very<00:00:11.070> much<00:00:11.820> more

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
built today is a very much more

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.099 
built today is a very much more
simplified<00:00:12.480> version<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.769> my<00:00:13.980> old<00:00:15.109> minecart

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
simplified version to my old minecart

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.980 
simplified version to my old minecart
system<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.400> basically<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.300> would<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.690> uh

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
system and basically this would just uh

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
system and basically this would just uh
you<00:00:19.710> could<00:00:19.890> call<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.609> cart<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.650> initially

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
you could call a cart in and I initially

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.679 
you could call a cart in and I initially
think<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:23.460> partially<00:00:23.730> broken<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
think it's partially broken at the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.099 
think it's partially broken at the
moment<00:00:24.920> but<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.279> did<00:00:26.550> work<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.119> had<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> video<00:00:27.779> on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
moment but it did work I had a video on

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
moment but it did work I had a video on
it<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.410> anyway<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.699> takes<00:00:30.150> way<00:00:30.449> too<00:00:30.480> long

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it and anyway it just takes way too long

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.530 
it and anyway it just takes way too long
to<00:00:31.230> receive<00:00:31.590> your<00:00:31.920> chests<00:00:32.160> send<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> back<00:00:32.850> it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to receive your chests send it back it's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.440 
to receive your chests send it back it's
way<00:00:33.840> too<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.739> redstone<00:00:35.340> too<00:00:35.550> big<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
way too much redstone too big and so I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.660 
way too much redstone too big and so I
simplified<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.950> much<00:00:38.340> more

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
simplified it over here it's much more

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.270 
simplified it over here it's much more
compact<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.420> much<00:00:39.540> smaller<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.190> gonna

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
compact and much smaller and I'm gonna

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.380 
compact and much smaller and I'm gonna
show<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.460> how<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> works

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
show you how it works

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.569 
show you how it works
and<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:43.469> gonna<00:00:43.770> show<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> Redstone

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and I'm gonna show you the Redstone

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.410 
and I'm gonna show you the Redstone
behind<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.309> it's<00:00:47.309> too<00:00:47.730> much<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.239> put<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
behind it and it's too much to put a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
behind it and it's too much to put a
tutorial<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> same<00:00:49.680> video<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.700> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
along but that one over there actually

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.260 
along but that one over there actually
has<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> system<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
has a system for that but that's not it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.550 
has a system for that but that's not it
shouldn't<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.570> too<00:01:42.720> hard<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.020> put<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
shouldn't be too hard to put into this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
shouldn't be too hard to put into this
system<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.220> maybe<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.909> later<00:01:45.119> in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
system I can maybe do that later in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.770 
system I can maybe do that later in
another<00:01:45.720> video<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.630> won't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
another video but for now it won't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
another video but for now it won't
really<00:01:49.020> work<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.530> tried<00:01:49.890> putting<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
really work I tried putting it in but it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.999 
really work I tried putting it in but it
won't<00:01:50.909> work<00:01:51.000> too<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:52.799> reason

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
won't work too well and for some reason

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.690 
won't work too well and for some reason
that<00:01:53.040> torch<00:01:53.369> acts<00:01:53.850> weird<00:01:54.560> like<00:01:55.560> flashes<00:01:56.549> at

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that torch acts weird like flashes at

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
that torch acts weird like flashes at
the<00:01:56.820> end<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.420> reason<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.930> usually<00:01:58.259> does

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.780 
the end for some reason or usually does
alright<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.729> let's<00:01:59.909> say<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> want<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:01.790> that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
alright so let's say I want my that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940 
alright so let's say I want my that
stuff<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.960> bring<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> me<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> don't

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
stuff you know bring it to me I don't

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
stuff you know bring it to me I don't
think<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.369> didn't<00:02:05.700> put<00:02:05.969> stuff<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
think I didn't put stuff in all the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.369 
think I didn't put stuff in all the
chests<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.789> show<00:02:09.319> just<00:02:10.319> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
chests I just put that for show just to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.020 
chests I just put that for show just to
demonstrate<00:02:10.920> all<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.489> I'm<00:02:11.580> rushing<00:02:11.910> out

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
demonstrate all right so I'm rushing out

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.360 
demonstrate all right so I'm rushing out
work<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.360> basically

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
work so basically

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.230 
work so basically
whenever<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> Redstone<00:02:17.730> behind<00:02:17.760> it

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
whenever this is the Redstone behind it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.100 
whenever this is the Redstone behind it
it's<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:18.720> compact<00:02:19.380> very<00:02:20.930> pushed<00:02:21.930> together

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
it's very compact very pushed together

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.520 
it's very compact very pushed together
basically<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> whenever<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.720> would<00:02:25.080> click<00:02:25.350> this

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
basically so whenever I would click this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.800 
basically so whenever I would click this
button<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.850> repeater<00:02:27.270> would<00:02:27.420> charge<00:02:27.660> this

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
button this repeater would charge this

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.140 
button this repeater would charge this
block<00:02:28.080> which<00:02:28.320> would<00:02:28.500> charge<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.310> tract<00:02:29.640> which

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
block which would charge the tract which

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.000 
block which would charge the tract which
would<00:02:30.300> send<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> cart<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:31.620> basically

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
would send the cart and that's basically

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.250 
would send the cart and that's basically
the<00:02:32.130> whole<00:02:32.250> sending<00:02:32.640> mechanism<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the whole sending mechanism and then a

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.560 
the whole sending mechanism and then a
signal<00:02:34.740> would<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.070> sent<00:02:35.430> down<00:02:35.550> here<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.450> this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
signal would be sent down here to this

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.820 
signal would be sent down here to this
RS<00:02:36.960> nor<00:02:37.110> latch<00:02:37.260> which<00:02:38.190> would<00:02:39.080> kind<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.710> like

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
RS nor latch which would kind of be like

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.070 
RS nor latch which would kind of be like
a<00:02:40.890> T<00:02:41.190> flip-flop<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:42.000> turn<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.630> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
a T flip-flop to turn this on and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.080 
a T flip-flop to turn this on and
whenever<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.350> turns<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.920> basically<00:02:47.850> this

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
whenever this turns on basically this

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.070 
whenever this turns on basically this
has<00:02:48.270> two<00:02:48.480> functions

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
has two functions

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.699 
has two functions
it<00:02:49.250> sets<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.490> track<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.390> turn<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.870> way<00:02:52.110> so

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it sets the track to turn that way so

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.460 
it sets the track to turn that way so
that<00:02:52.860> whenever<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.370> car<00:02:53.850> comes<00:02:54.120> back<00:02:54.470> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
that whenever the car comes back it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.610 
that whenever the car comes back it
would<00:02:55.740> go<00:02:55.950> into<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.370> appropriate<00:02:56.640> slot

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
would go into the appropriate slot

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.310 
would go into the appropriate slot
instead<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.740> going<00:02:59.040> keep<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.209> up<00:03:00.330> it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
instead of going keep on going up it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.100 
instead of going keep on going up it
would<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.800> turn<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.220> right<00:03:02.430> here<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.240> so

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
would just turn in right here and so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.050 
would just turn in right here and so
that's<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.040> first<00:03:05.070> function<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that's the first function and then the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.730 
that's the first function and then the
second<00:03:06.420> function<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:08.060> shows<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.740> basically

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
second function it shows you basically

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.910 
second function it shows you basically
comes<00:03:10.980> down<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.400> show<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.640> what<00:03:11.790> uh<00:03:12.920> like

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
comes down here to show you what uh like

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.630 
comes down here to show you what uh like
what<00:03:14.630> chest<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.500> car<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.980> called<00:03:17.220> like

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
what chest or what car you called like

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.210 
what chest or what car you called like
that<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.530> hopefully<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.560> didn't<00:03:19.890> call<00:03:20.100> them

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
that and hopefully I didn't call them

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.820 
that and hopefully I didn't call them
two<00:03:20.400> at<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.610> same<00:03:20.760> time<00:03:21.000> no<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.540> didn't<00:03:22.200> all

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
two at the same time no I didn't all

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.910 
two at the same time no I didn't all
right<00:03:23.010> uh<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:24.680> also<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:26.790> system<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.800> this<00:03:28.800> is

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
right uh and also this system if this is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.220 
right uh and also this system if this is
basically<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.610> don't<00:03:30.360> know<00:03:30.480> what<00:03:30.630> gate<00:03:30.930> it's

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
basically I don't know what gate it's

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.080 
basically I don't know what gate it's
called<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.560> think<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.800> has<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> name<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:32.640> any

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
called I think it has a name but if any

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.320 
called I think it has a name but if any
of<00:03:33.209> these<00:03:33.360> are<00:03:33.570> turned<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:34.250> then<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:36.060> will

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
of these are turned on then this will

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.820 
of these are turned on then this will
turn<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:37.010> which<00:03:38.010> makes<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.970> light<00:03:39.209> turn<00:03:39.450> on

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
turn on which makes this light turn on

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.440 
turn on which makes this light turn on
right<00:03:40.830> here<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.820> same<00:03:41.850> thing<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
right here and the same thing for the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.550 
right here and the same thing for the
other<00:03:42.480> side<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.730> basically<00:03:45.090> whenever<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.959> turn

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
other side so basically whenever I turn

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.360 
other side so basically whenever I turn
this<00:03:46.769> button<00:03:47.010> off<00:03:48.769> or<00:03:49.769> when<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.950> rest<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
this button off or when I rest in the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.160 
this button off or when I rest in the
car<00:03:50.550> back<00:03:50.820> these<00:03:51.300> should<00:03:51.540> turn<00:03:51.750> off<00:03:54.170> whatever

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
car back these should turn off whatever

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.830 
car back these should turn off whatever
that<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:56.459> whole<00:03:56.610> thing<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.000> reset<00:03:57.420> as<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.720> can

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
that the whole thing is reset as you can

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.140 
that the whole thing is reset as you can
see<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.550> reset<00:03:59.910> system

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
see and this is the reset system

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.320 
see and this is the reset system
whenever<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.840> cart<00:04:01.140> drops<00:04:01.680> down<00:04:02.090> it'll<00:04:03.090> run

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
whenever the cart drops down it'll run

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.449 
whenever the cart drops down it'll run
over<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:03.690> detector<00:04:04.230> rail<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.980> someone's

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
over this detector rail and someone's

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.680 
over this detector rail and someone's
calling<00:04:05.760> me<00:04:05.790> hold<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.920> alright<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.340> then

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
calling me hold on alright and then

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.750 
calling me hold on alright and then
basically<00:04:09.690> these<00:04:10.500> gets<00:04:11.190> sent<00:04:11.400> into<00:04:11.459> these

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
basically these gets sent into these

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.690 
basically these gets sent into these
repeaters<00:04:12.180> which<00:04:12.830> resets<00:04:13.830> every<00:04:14.190> RS<00:04:14.519> nor

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
repeaters which resets every RS nor

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.599 
repeaters which resets every RS nor
latch<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.239> system<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.169> that's<00:04:17.160> how<00:04:17.580> I

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
latch in the system and that's how I

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.340 
latch in the system and that's how I
gets<00:04:17.880> reset<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:19.650> yeah<00:04:20.640> that's<00:04:21.000> basically<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
gets reset and yeah that's basically the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.510 
gets reset and yeah that's basically the
whole<00:04:23.419> system<00:04:24.419> behind<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.229> if<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.220> want

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
whole system behind it and if you want

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.560 
whole system behind it and if you want
it<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:27.090> have

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
it to have

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.690 
it to have
button<00:04:27.960> by<00:04:28.080> button<00:04:28.110> then<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.130> have<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.370> set<00:04:29.580> up

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
button by button then you have to set up

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.540 
button by button then you have to set up
your<00:04:29.790> carts<00:04:30.590> kind<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.680> like<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:32.040> zigzag

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
your carts kind of like a zigzag

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.100 
your carts kind of like a zigzag
formation<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:35.340> can<00:04:35.520> have

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
formation like that so that you can have

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.500 
formation like that so that you can have
your<00:04:37.110> turning<00:04:37.590> tracks<00:04:37.950> at<00:04:38.760> every<00:04:39.180> end<00:04:39.330> with

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
your turning tracks at every end with

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.500 
your turning tracks at every end with
powered<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.110> middle<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:42.090> yeah<00:04:42.300> that's

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
powered in the middle and so yeah that's

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.910 
powered in the middle and so yeah that's
basically<00:04:42.780> how<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> works

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920
