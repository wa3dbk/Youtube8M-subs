right<00:02:57.590> here

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
right here

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.599 
right here
maybe<00:02:59.359> it's<00:02:59.540> little<00:02:59.719> safer<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.109> wait<00:03:00.319> but<00:03:01.099> you

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
maybe it's little safer to wait but you

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.199 
maybe it's little safer to wait but you
know<00:03:01.819> whatever<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.419> can<00:03:02.629> get<00:03:02.750> away<00:03:02.840> with<00:03:04.209> so

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
know whatever you can get away with so

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.610 
know whatever you can get away with so
I'm<00:03:05.329> waiting<00:03:05.629> here<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.019> box<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.409> pass

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
I'm waiting here for the box to pass

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.099 
I'm waiting here for the box to pass

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
because if it lands on you it can crush

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.699 
because if it lands on you it can crush
you<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.500> you'll<00:03:09.950> die<00:03:11.169> like<00:03:12.169> I<00:03:12.290> said<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.590> can

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
before it stops swinging well because

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.690 
before it stops swinging well because
you<00:04:11.140> can<00:04:11.260> see<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.440> grounds<00:04:11.650> electrified<00:04:12.130> and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
then just make it over this jump and

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.250 
then just make it over this jump and
that's<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.350> for<00:04:14.470> chapter<00:04:14.500> 16
