00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.320
 check out my favorite viewers i'm on today 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.269
 the kitchen will cook puffs with apple 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.890
 delicious on any at any tea 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.990
 with pleasure everything will be delicious 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.180
 let's start the recipe for that degree 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.670
 easy to handle probably any 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.230
 let's start we need puff 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.269
 I have the dough here 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.739
 he is 500 grams apple 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.520
 some butter and cinnamon also 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.610
 need an egg 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.980
 yolk for lubrication apples cleaned 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.450
 peel and from the viscera cut 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:53.180
 such small triangle cubes 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.180
 pan send vegetable oil 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 after she is a little hub 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.380
 it's all doing a little could 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.380
 add there our apples the old lady 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.619
 and here is such a dilemma if you have apples 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.840
 savory 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.000
 there are such acidic varieties that need 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.880
 add sugar 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.250
 if they have you sweet like mine then i don't 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.170
 add these I would Kim a little stew 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.659
 to make them soft 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.810
 but no tour but how would they 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.509
 soaked with cinnamon and their juice have become 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 a little softer go to our test 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.340
 I have two such layers 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.520
 it needs a little roll in one 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.709
 direction from one layer I have here 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.090
 turned out such a square now we have it 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:03.340
 cut into portions cut into 4 pieces and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.459
 from one reservoir are such 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:13.380
 four parts now in one will do with 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.380
 on the one hand, we will make some cuts 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.010
 It looks closer 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.680
 the apples are ready for us 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.500
 cooled on our prepared dough 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.650
 lay out in this part where we are not 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.650
 cut our stuffing 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.680
 after you put the stuffing then 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.739
 most convenient to pinch the edges when 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 help plug and it turns out so beautiful 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.670
 little pattern 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 you see 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.170
 from all sides 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.090
 I spread puffs I make such a gap 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.300
 because they will still 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.610
 swell and now I will put in 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.760
 oven oven me pre 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.410
 warmed up and how to put our 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.400
 puff in the oven take the egg yolk 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.580
 preferably kill and grease them to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:50.270
 beautiful glitter oven warmed up at me 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:52.940
 up to 180 degrees minutes thirty second 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.980
 recipe a che the same current place apples i 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.100
 I will use cottage cheese 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.690
 I'll tell you how much 5 percent 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.160
 little greasy and cottage cheese we will need 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:13.970
 rub sugar because we 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:19.340
 of course so tasteless that's where I am 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:22.190
 take a half at home i think that 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.340
 how much is enough for me just before 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.240
 terraces or powdered sugar add 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.240
 some vanilla 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.510
 all this is thoroughly mixed city 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.080
 ready to take of course try to take 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.310
 natural your not artificial 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.890
 the only cottage cheese I know 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.130
 which I take this one precisely because 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.380
 a lot of fakes and artificial 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.900
 tours of course not the one there very much 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.870
 starch any substitutes so before 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.480
 try to continue the process right there 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.110
 same same dough with 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.460

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.830
 bon appetit 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.040
