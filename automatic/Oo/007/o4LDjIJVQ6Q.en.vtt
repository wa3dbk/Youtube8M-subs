the<00:03:14.880> right<00:03:15.000> format<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.990> good<00:03:16.650> thing<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.860> make

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the right format so good thing I make

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.220 
the right format so good thing I make
these<00:03:17.160> little<00:03:17.370> mistakes<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:19.020> can

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
these little mistakes so that you can

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.770 
these little mistakes so that you can
learn<00:03:19.350> from<00:03:19.410> them<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:19.800> guess<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.300> once<00:03:21.570> those

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
learn from them I guess so so once those

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.900 
learn from them I guess so so once those
are<00:03:22.220> selected<00:03:23.220> right<00:03:23.370> then<00:03:23.550> we're<00:03:23.640> gonna<00:03:23.730> hit

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
are selected right then we're gonna hit

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.470 
are selected right then we're gonna hit
OK

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
OK

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.560

which I have for my suspend minister

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.120 
which I have for my suspend minister
ater<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:08.390> this<00:04:09.390> pin<00:04:09.660> number<00:04:09.990> we<00:04:10.680> recommend

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
ater so this pin number we recommend

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.680 
ater so this pin number we recommend
using<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.459> password<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.970> at<00:04:12.120> least<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.570> know

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
using a password of at least you know

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.230 
using a password of at least you know
eight<00:04:12.930> digits<00:04:13.410> in<00:04:13.620> length<00:04:13.940> just<00:04:14.940> for<00:04:15.120> higher

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
eight digits in length just for higher

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.220 
eight digits in length just for higher
security<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:16.170> I<00:04:16.470> hit<00:04:17.310> activate<00:04:17.790> on<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.230> now

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
security so I hit activate on that now

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.660 
security so I hit activate on that now
providing<00:04:19.770> that<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.549> right

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670

and<00:04:24.360> show<00:04:24.570> me<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.560> not<00:04:25.740> correct<00:04:26.190> it's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
and show me if it's not correct it's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.840 
and show me if it's not correct it's
going<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.580> keep

popping up and and asking you for the
passcode<00:04:29.340> again<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.600> looks<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:31.020> took

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
passcode again so it looks like it took
