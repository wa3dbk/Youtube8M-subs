00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
from Brazil not the most amazing player

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.490 
from Brazil not the most amazing player
in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> world<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.200> does<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in the world but you know it does the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
in the world but you know it does the
job<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.430> fit<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> nicely<00:01:18.060> into<00:01:18.509> our

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
team as you can see here Rafa soubise

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.330 
team as you can see here Rafa soubise
and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:24.030> another<00:01:24.780> player<00:01:25.110> she<00:01:25.439> scored

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and I think another player she scored

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
and I think another player she scored
two<00:01:26.490> goals<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.540> obviously<00:01:28.049> he<00:01:28.320> he

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
two goals there and then obviously he he

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.219 
two goals there and then obviously he he
gets<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.630> hazard<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> then

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
gets it to one with hazard and then

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
gets it to one with hazard and then
again<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.920> shortly<00:01:32.250> after<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.360> makes<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.720> 22

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
again not shortly after it makes it 22

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440 
again not shortly after it makes it 22
with<00:01:34.200> perini<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.369> again<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
with perini which is again you know a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.630 
with perini which is again you know a
bit<00:01:37.020> annoying<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.890> behalf<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
bit annoying on our behalf because it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.999

we<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> bit<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.660> trading<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.080> well<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
we do do a bit of trading as well in a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.410 
we do do a bit of trading as well in a
couple<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.830> episodes<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:21.090> here<00:03:21.269> we're<00:03:21.390> just

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
couple of episodes but here we're just

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.199 
couple of episodes but here we're just
searching<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.680> formation<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.550> would<00:03:23.880> fit

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
searching for a formation that would fit

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.720 
searching for a formation that would fit
us<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:25.470> know<00:03:25.620> maybe<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.130> better<00:03:26.400> than<00:03:26.610> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
us you know maybe a bit better than the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.870 
us you know maybe a bit better than the
4321<00:03:27.300> formation<00:03:27.720> i<00:03:28.470> was<00:03:28.560> think<00:03:28.709> about<00:03:28.739> 451<00:03:29.519> but

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
4321 formation i was think about 451 but

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.270 
4321 formation i was think about 451 but
you<00:03:30.000> know<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:30.989> remember<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.350> being<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.800> bit

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
you know I just remember it being a bit

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.750 
you know I just remember it being a bit
too<00:03:32.310> complicated<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:33.750> play<00:03:33.959> with<00:03:34.140> especially

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
too complicated to play with especially

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.970 
too complicated to play with especially
when<00:03:35.760> building<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.120> hybrid<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.950> very

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
when building a hybrid is you know very

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.580 
when building a hybrid is you know very
quite<00:03:38.459> annoying<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:39.170> 42<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.320> singing<00:03:40.530> about

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
quite annoying but 42 is singing about

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.440 
quite annoying but 42 is singing about
as<00:03:40.920> well<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.220> very<00:03:41.459> easy<00:03:41.670> formation<00:03:42.239> for

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
as well it's very easy formation for

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.540 
as well it's very easy formation for
hybrids<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.830> end<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.040> think<00:03:44.280> I'd<00:03:44.370> do

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
hybrids but in the end I think I'd do

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.710 
hybrids but in the end I think I'd do
just<00:03:44.580> settle<00:03:45.000> with<00:03:45.150> four<00:03:45.360> three<00:03:45.540> two<00:03:45.690> one

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
just settle with four three two one

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.720 
just settle with four three two one
because<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.920> sort<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.340> formation

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
because it is sort of the formation

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.440 
because it is sort of the formation
which<00:03:48.180> i<00:03:48.480> was<00:03:48.720> using<00:03:48.900> last<00:03:49.200> time<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:51.000> was

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
which i was using last time and I was

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.820 
which i was using last time and I was
kind<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.690> comfortable<00:03:51.989> comfortable<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.709> it

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
kind of comfortable comfortable with it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.280 
kind of comfortable comfortable with it

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
usually that's the main point you build

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.199 
usually that's the main point you build
your<00:04:07.860> habit<00:04:08.130> around<00:04:08.400> or<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> center<00:04:08.910> mid<00:04:09.060> as

well<00:04:09.390> looking<00:04:10.230> at<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.380> few<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.709> blue<00:04:10.890> cards

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
well looking at a few of the blue cards

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.650 
well looking at a few of the blue cards
not<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.640> would<00:04:11.970> really<00:04:12.239> be<00:04:12.390> able<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
not that I would really be able to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.509 
not that I would really be able to
afford<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:13.170> but<00:04:13.830> it's<00:04:13.980> quite<00:04:14.160> interesting

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
afford them but it's quite interesting

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.759 
afford them but it's quite interesting
to<00:04:14.760> see<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.390> know<00:04:15.750> for<00:04:15.989> future<00:04:16.109> episodes<00:04:16.350> and

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
to see you know for future episodes and

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.610 
to see you know for future episodes and
further<00:04:17.400> into<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.820> game<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.169> might<00:04:19.470> even

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
further into this game that I might even

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.229 
further into this game that I might even
be<00:04:19.739> able<00:04:19.830> to<00:04:19.950> buy<00:04:20.070> them<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.760> think<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:21.209> you

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
be able to buy them but I think as you

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.820 
be able to buy them but I think as you
will<00:04:21.419> have<00:04:21.539> seen<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.780> your<00:04:21.900> screen<00:04:22.109> strip<00:04:22.470> just

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
will have seen on your screen strip just

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.250 
will have seen on your screen strip just
then<00:04:23.130> we<00:04:23.820> saw<00:04:24.000> Robinho<00:04:24.539> in<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.840> striker<00:04:25.140> for

then we saw Robinho in a striker for
three<00:04:25.590> two<00:04:25.770> one

ending in around 3 minutes or so and
there<00:04:29.280> was<00:04:29.370> only<00:04:29.430> about<00:04:29.610> free<00:04:29.970> have<00:04:30.090> free

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
there was only about free have free
