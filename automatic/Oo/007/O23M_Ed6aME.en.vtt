00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.720
 Kostanay model model my model 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.300
 anti-tank gun this is german 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.630
 pak40 anti - tank gun 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.760
 before you is a model model of a custom company 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.070
 Brek instructions you can download 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.750
 free on their website like 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.150
 introductory model is the most 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.979
 just a little what they do but before 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.909
 you this gun anti-guns 

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:38.649
 pak40 times of the second world war 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:42.100
 75mm barrel in general so 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.139
 creepy thing quite famous story with 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.850
 originals you will not tell me 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:47.769
 it's not very interesting who needs it here 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.739
 You googled this one and I already know 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.530
 I will focus on the features of the assembly that 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.299
 interesting you can see here 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.639
 externally, the model looks very basic 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.369
 even nothing with the original 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.739
 certainly not the perfect length of the trunk she 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:05.710
 too small in the original generally very long 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.430
 should be lower should be a gun then 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.870
 there are proportions to them of course 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.450
 real others should be hers 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.940
 the proportions however there are interesting 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.790
 moments and how much it is interesting so on 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.630
 my mind is disgusting now show 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.180
 scientists from interesting moments 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.159
 where are you going to cool 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.229
 creep gun itself minus gun not 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.640
 rotates that is someone detail 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.600
 long she holds this part 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.450
 and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.750
 the basis of which is mounted wheels otherwise it is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.140
 everything generally falls off so the gun is not 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.119
 turns here and disgusting 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.040
 time here at this gun 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.979
 data wheel chock they 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.270
 fall off constantly check 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.200
 mount on binoculars and these things he's mine 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.680
 he looks terrible 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.320
 here until I collected when I saw this 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.729
 I gave the instructions cool but such 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.350
 speed will not and its option and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.750
 especially a little bit different now 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.410
 I understand that this option is only 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.820
 option on the shelf nadya frame to play with 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.100
 by this or somehow use 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.440
 in general, it is impossible to constantly creature 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.560
 as in binoculars , as you can see 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.310
 here holes like metaldeath snap 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.579
 they hold very very tales and once again 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.260
 too bad it has to deliver and can be but 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.690
 during assembly 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.530
 she 's constantly debug me interesting 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.980
 done then the shields will be quite mounts 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.860
 I liked it originally 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.260
 Here is a tool to give a total and 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.620
 true name homemade gun 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.470
 falling apart in the hands of this minus but if 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.330
 you need and put somewhere on 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.159
 Dmitry Nadya frame some of your 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.420
 use can be for cartoons 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.879
 although you have to tinker with these to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.760
 the option is quite so impossible granite 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.250
 can you use it for me 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.860
 she did not like much though interesting 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 the solution in the design is let 's 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.180
 traditions a couple of photos and we will 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.180
 complete the review of this model 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.790
 here we looked dan with you 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.160
 modelka is small 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.200
 she has her pluses and minuses i 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.239
 I donâ€™t really like military equipment 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.099
 when her 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.470
 whether you are going to collect it yourself 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.300
 instructions invoice you always look 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.930
 some ideas you can use 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.849
 and their other homemade products fell off in 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.790
 I liked this model mount 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.330
 from this part but then connected with i 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.870
 built 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.840
 but I really liked the lining here these 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.540
 emphasis they fall off the ducks that poured 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.390
 not a playable thing at all but on the shelf 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.580
 In principle, you can put on this I 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.070
 goodbye you put like if you 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.079
