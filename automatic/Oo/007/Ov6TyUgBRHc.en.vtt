own um I bought one it actually was like

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.130 
own um I bought one it actually was like
the<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:24.510> i<00:00:24.630> ever<00:00:24.660> bought<00:00:25.080> from

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the very first game i ever bought from

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.790 
the very first game i ever bought from
boards<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> bits<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.699> import<00:00:27.449> copy<00:00:27.800> back

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
boards and bits it was import copy back

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.169 
boards and bits it was import copy back
when<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.099> tough<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> hold<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
when it was tough to get a hold of and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.460 
when it was tough to get a hold of and
so<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> actually<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.019> did<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so I actually I did like the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.959 
so I actually I did like the
compatibility<00:00:32.160> kit<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.640> everything<00:00:32.880> like

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
compatibility kit and everything like

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
compatibility kit and everything like
that<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.600> tiles<00:00:33.899> would<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> same<00:00:34.590> as

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that so my tiles would be the same as

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
that so my tiles would be the same as
the<00:00:34.770> expansions<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the expansions and what have you and I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.959 
the expansions and what have you and I
ended<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.840> trading<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.380> away<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.969> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
ended up trading that away and I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.619 
ended up trading that away and I
remember<00:00:39.629> thinking<00:00:40.170> yeah<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.520> few<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
remember thinking yeah a few of you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
remember thinking yeah a few of you
might<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.260> seen<00:00:43.440> my<00:00:43.950> review<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> I'd

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
might have seen my review of that I'd

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
might have seen my review of that I'd
run<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> galaxy<00:00:45.329> trucker<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.110> didn't<00:00:46.770> give

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
run a galaxy trucker and I didn't give

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920 
run a galaxy trucker and I didn't give
it<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.670> best<00:00:47.910> review<00:00:48.300> ever<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.600> said<00:00:48.840> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it like the best review ever I said it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
it like the best review ever I said it
was<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.230> game<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.649> wasn't<00:00:49.920> awesome<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
was a good game it wasn't awesome and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
was a good game it wasn't awesome and
then<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.210> remember<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.840> remember<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.320> traded<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
then I remember I remember I traded the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430 
then I remember I remember I traded the
game<00:00:52.890> away<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.289> between

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
game away and I think that was between

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
game away and I think that was between
print<00:00:55.890> runs<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.610> tough<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
print runs and so it's tough to get a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.189 
print runs and so it's tough to get a
hold<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> him<00:00:57.420> somebody<00:00:57.719> offered<00:00:58.170> me

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
hold of him somebody offered me

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
hold of him somebody offered me
something<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:58.949> good<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.120> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
something that was really good and so I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
something that was really good and so I
traded<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.620> remember<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> month

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
traded it and I remember like a month

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
traded it and I remember like a month
later<00:01:03.270> i<00:01:03.570> immediately<00:01:03.989> regretted<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
later i immediately regretted it and I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.330 
later i immediately regretted it and I
was<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.080> jonesing<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> play<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> game

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
was just I was jonesing to play the game

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.410 
was just I was jonesing to play the game
and<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> bought<00:01:11.100> another<00:01:11.310> copy<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and so I bought another copy and it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
and so I bought another copy and it
actually<00:01:12.869> had<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> rebirth<00:01:13.920> within<00:01:14.909> my

ton of cardboard I'm assuming all right

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.510 
ton of cardboard I'm assuming all right
so<00:04:02.680> shouldn't<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.740> too<00:04:03.980> much<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.160> a<00:04:04.370> surprise

finally looks like we have oh ok this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.280 
finally looks like we have oh ok this
would<00:04:26.450> be<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.720> base<00:04:26.990> game<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:29.570> trucker's

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
would be the base game the trucker's

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.950 
would be the base game the trucker's
guide<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.890> galaxy<00:04:31.460> that's<00:04:31.730> for<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.390> base

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
guide to the galaxy that's for the base

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.940 
guide to the galaxy that's for the base
game<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.920> then<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:35.570> expanded<00:04:36.530> guide<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.920> the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
game and then the expanded guide to the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.310 
game and then the expanded guide to the
galaxy<00:04:37.460> for<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.790> first<00:04:38.000> expansion<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:40.580> then

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
galaxy for the first expansion and then

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.910 
galaxy for the first expansion and then
the<00:04:42.320> another<00:04:42.890> expanded<00:04:43.730> guide<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.380> galaxy

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
the another expanded guide to the galaxy

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.130 
the another expanded guide to the galaxy
so<00:04:46.280> ask<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.670> for<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.880> third<00:04:47.120> expansion<00:04:47.390> it's

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
so ask you for the third expansion it's
