on<00:00:12.110> ice<00:00:12.379> session<00:00:12.889> is<00:00:13.010> the<00:00:13.129> application<00:00:13.279> of

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
on ice session is the application of

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.129 
on ice session is the application of
what<00:00:14.029> we<00:00:14.150> do<00:00:14.270> on<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:14.480> weight<00:00:14.629> room<00:00:14.779> and<00:00:14.959> on<00:00:15.020> the

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
what we do on the weight room and on the

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.260 
what we do on the weight room and on the
track<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:15.709> how<00:00:16.070> we<00:00:16.129> can<00:00:16.250> apply<00:00:16.580> that<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.150> what

track and how we can apply that to what

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.700 
track and how we can apply that to what
we<00:00:17.359> do<00:00:17.480> on<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.750> ice<00:00:17.900> we're<00:00:18.500> going<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.650> start

we do on the ice we're going to start
with<00:00:18.949> just<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:19.250> dynamic<00:00:19.699> warmup<00:00:20.029> a<00:00:20.210> lot<00:00:20.390> like

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539

going to apply it to the ice so here we
go<00:00:23.179> we'll<00:00:23.720> just<00:00:23.869> go<00:00:23.960> around<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.320> circle<00:00:24.499> will

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
go we'll just go around the circle will

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.710 
go we'll just go around the circle will
work<00:00:24.980> on<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.130> couple<00:00:25.339> drills<00:00:25.759> first<00:00:26.539> thing

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
high knee concentrate on one side will

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.260 
high knee concentrate on one side will
do<00:00:32.419> seven<00:00:32.870> on<00:00:32.960> one<00:00:33.170> side<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:33.880> don't<00:00:34.880> have<00:00:34.970> carry

do seven on one side I don't have carry

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.680 
do seven on one side I don't have carry
switch<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.840> other<00:00:35.960> side<00:00:37.360> high<00:00:38.360> knee<00:00:38.420> on

switch to the other side high knee on
the<00:00:38.720> other<00:00:38.930> side<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:44.630> now<00:00:44.720> we<00:00:44.840> can<00:00:44.990> do

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
the other side and now we can do

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.230 
the other side and now we can do
rotation<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:45.770> we<00:00:45.860> go<00:00:45.980> with<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.130> high<00:00:46.370> knee<00:00:46.430> and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
rotation so we go with a high knee and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.610 
rotation so we go with a high knee and
we'll<00:00:47.420> rotate<00:00:47.630> it<00:00:47.930> around<00:00:47.990> we<00:00:48.230> really<00:00:48.410> want<00:00:48.560> to
