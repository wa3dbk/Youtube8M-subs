00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.320 

so<00:00:08.309> now<00:00:08.490> we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> install<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
so now we're going to install the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.860

striker<00:00:09.630> plate<00:00:09.929> onto<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.920> frame<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.690> best

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
striker plate onto the frame so the best

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.250 
striker plate onto the frame so the best
idea<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.380> put<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> striker<00:00:13.889> plate<00:00:15.020> in<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
idea is to put the striker plate in the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
idea is to put the striker plate in the
door<00:00:16.440> first<00:00:18.020> like<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:20.180> then<00:00:21.180> close<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
door first like that and then close the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
door first like that and then close the
door<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:23.090> we'll<00:00:24.090> mark<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.810> top<00:00:25.050> part<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
door and then we'll mark the top part of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.170 
door and then we'll mark the top part of
the<00:00:26.670> striker<00:00:26.939> plate<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> frame<00:00:29.060> by<00:00:30.060> that
