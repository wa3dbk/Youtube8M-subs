00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.430
 they were born in the late 19th century it was derived from the bicycle and the other 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.149
 derived from the carriage 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.829
 from that moment they started to compete 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:16.760
 for you 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.119
 consumer 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.010
 today just over 100 years 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.560
 after this story even if you ask questions like which one is the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.890
 better with the car 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 We'll win 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 ibra tries to answer that question. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
 on my right side leandro mello with his bmw thousand and two hundred 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.010
 and in my left fernando corner revealed with his bmw c4 pm 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.820
 in every year of pleasure that arms are presented 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.970
 I will think a lot about what I think was a milestone 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.740
 in the history of bmw 15 best or in technology and comfort 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.040
 it is from this model that 9 arbil spent and engineers to develop the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.090
 bike also establishes ways i know bmw 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 I use motorport 102 followed by 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.360
 barely reaches the 100 horses this motorcycle already comes with four engine 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.119
 cylinders with more than 160 horses so it was a milestone for bmw what she 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.200
 united comfort and performance technology 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.969
 The interesting thing about this bike 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.829
 It makes different any other motorcycle is 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.109
 bring the electric power leco 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.840
 I did not know Pedro. You can push a button. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 you have three types of regulation performance normal 'to comfortable 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.239
 and there sportv even with the motorcycle in motion and depending on the situation 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.569
 you may be operating this year's operation may be 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.809
 busy 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:33.489
 I do not keep the bike because I think the art of motorcycle riding is 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.759
 most pleasurable you have to go 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.089
 works the full weight of your body whether it is an arm in the forced air to true 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.049
 force on your leg pulling 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.709
 so I think 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.920
 is a set of art form of motorcycle riding for me more pleasurable 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.670
 and acceleration of the motorcycle in front of the car uses resume acceleration of the motorcycle 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.749
 I think it will take too long to make a car appear 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.140
 Fernando, why do you think your bmw 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.869
 It's better than cure the problem. 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.579
 I must have lost the first place in the group and a little more comfort 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.379
 b is the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.849
 this purpose was above all precisely because 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.219
 you can see that the specific use car 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.099
 are two places and pilates there is also the cabriolet version error 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.019
 mix a little until then 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.329
 the process is only different from being removed 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.809
 you hear what I prefer plus the four goals still because 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.339
 to me opposite the air conditioning I can have a camicase it was so good 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.299
 how much a motorcycle with the local finished pdv I had a flu 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.479
 the tite on the curve barely wait what for example 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.889
 and has almost double the power in a year 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.519
 only that there is a whole apparatus of the weight ratio of 70 you 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.519
 will realize 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.610
 season sir jayder soares 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.410
 at this age 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.580
 curves and sits in the front show of the singer make feel the concept passes in the network 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.409
 in the middle of the curve why have not you already taken all 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.110
 honey gibson you get out of my face contact still balancing me plagiarized 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.699
 with the upturned butt 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 Let's have some nonsense. 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.120
 the repair of grace 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.460
 despite the steep fall 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.059
 What's the time, it's time to learn 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.059
 prose and poetry 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.339
 in this new world 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.529
 for sure i just thought of the car you in the hand on my face 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.860
 but there is this kindness that plagues the front of the camera of the melon woman I imagined that 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.650
 I still can not feel the matter 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.580
 nothing is revealed more famous of the automobile adriano will continue using engines 2 0
