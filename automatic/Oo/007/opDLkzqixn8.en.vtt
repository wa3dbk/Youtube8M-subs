00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:40.239
 but without chemistry 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.670
 and I go to option 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.390
 live 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.550
 if you do not like it 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.880
 the competition was composed of 10 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.010
 tracks of different categories 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.140
 modified super modified and free in 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.360
 Each participant will participate in 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.550
 four or five tracks can be a jeep 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.650
 that is highly modified can be 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.990
 a tubular vehicle manufactured for this 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.840
 kind of tracks there are pilots of mexico that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.930
 have competed in the USA and have obtained 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.080
 good places obviously in the usa there 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.600
 more there is more capital and there are better 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.280
 vehicles there is more technology but in 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.570
 mexico are not left behind there are very good 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.110
 vehicles equipped with very good 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.430
 pilots if at any time in 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.710
 any team competitor 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.970
 participate in a US serial and it does not go 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 to stay does not show it 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.240
 for me 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.240
 when 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 for all 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.620
 tango 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.390
 but the most crawling club we come four 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.069
 competitors and we come in the category 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.590
 of super modified and good 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.319
 expectations is to be able to take some 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.959
 some recognition this from the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.969
 club and if it's not good only with 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.709
 finish the routes as the scores 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.180
 and more than anything else, continue to acquire 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.040
 experience in this beautiful sport because 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.019
 I calculate that I have in this in 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.540
 this vehicle took almost 300 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.939
 thousand pesos and it does not end but you do not finish 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.519
 this simply good a tire 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.909
 it costs you seven thousand pesos they last you a 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.069
 year then I'm not a sport that you 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.260
 you wait for this kind of events to be able to 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.000
 get some benefit or some prize 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.639
 to help you a little bit not to 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.100
 counteract this will be the only woman who 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:25.260
 will enter here to compete like this is 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.640
 nerves the normal nerves there 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.240
 but good to see how it's going 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.240
 approximately four years 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.580
 my dad my dad was already in this and 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.570
 I started to accompany him and because he started me 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.480
 to like and I started to put one of 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.070
 special, I believe that women and 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.170
 men we have the same capacity not 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.990
 then it is not you do not feel something 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.960
 special and good to see how this is going 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.940
 and this is a risk we do not know how we 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.940
 will go by as modified as it is 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.450
 forehead 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.630
 before 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.669
 when 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.060
 arango
