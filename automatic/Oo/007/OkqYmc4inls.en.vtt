00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
lines and then go look in the mirror and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.920 
lines and then go look in the mirror and
I've<00:02:11.800> got<00:02:11.980> all<00:02:12.130> these<00:02:12.250> greasy<00:02:12.640> bits<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.420> makeup

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
but it's stuck in that so I tried to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.980 
but it's stuck in that so I tried to
sort<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.410> tackle<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.160> currently<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.390> today

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
sort of tackle that currently and today

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.500 
sort of tackle that currently and today
I'm<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.680> try<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.310> my<00:02:21.430> bags<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.240> to

I'm going to try this on my bags and to

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.440 
I'm going to try this on my bags and to
see<00:02:22.750> what<00:02:23.410> difference<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.160> makes<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.940> see<00:02:25.240> if

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
see what difference it makes and see if

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110 
see what difference it makes and see if
you<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.690> actually<00:02:25.840> tell<00:02:26.050> on<00:02:26.530> camera<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you can actually tell on camera the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
you can actually tell on camera the
difference<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.690> does<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.770> I'm

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
difference that it does make so I'm

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
difference that it does make so I'm
going<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.520> zoom<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.820> now<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:34.000> see<00:02:34.570> my<00:02:35.290> name

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
going to zoom in now the see my name

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890 
going to zoom in now the see my name
yeah<00:02:36.250> I'm<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.180> sure<00:02:37.270> what<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.570> cream<00:02:37.750> is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
yeah I'm not sure what this cream is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.150 
yeah I'm not sure what this cream is
gonna<00:02:38.050> do<00:02:38.290> because<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> lines<00:02:38.890> aren't

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
gonna do because the lines aren't

00:02:39.160 --> 00:03:37.640 
gonna do because the lines aren't
actually<00:02:39.640> there

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.650 

okay<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.710> I'm<00:03:38.950> not<00:03:39.100> sure<00:03:39.160> exactly<00:03:39.760> if<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.480> can

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
okay so I'm not sure exactly if you can

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.630 
okay so I'm not sure exactly if you can
see<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.170> camera<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:41.980> it's<00:03:42.130> made<00:03:42.280> much<00:03:42.490> of<00:03:42.520> a

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
see on camera that it's made much of a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.400 
see on camera that it's made much of a
difference<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:43.360> think<00:03:43.660> because<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.080> don't<00:03:44.110> have

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
difference I think because I don't have

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.560 
difference I think because I don't have
really<00:03:44.650> obvious<00:03:44.980> wrinkles<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.450> know

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
really obvious wrinkles and you know

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.060 
really obvious wrinkles and you know
don't<00:03:46.720> suffer<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.380> heavily<00:03:47.680> whether<00:03:47.890> it's

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
don't suffer that heavily whether it's

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.340 
don't suffer that heavily whether it's
hard<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.460> see<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.880> real<00:03:49.180> difference<00:03:49.480> I've<00:03:50.290> seen

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
hard to see a real difference I've seen

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.230 
hard to see a real difference I've seen
videos<00:03:50.650> where<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.310> know<00:03:51.460> older<00:03:51.850> ladies<00:03:52.120> have

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.510 
got really really you know properly
saggy<00:03:54.820> bags<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.960> you<00:03:56.110> bags<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.620> they're

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
just gone instantly but just by using

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.600 
just gone instantly but just by using
that<00:04:00.490> on<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:01.030> eye<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:02.170> see<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:03.010> I've<00:04:03.430> just

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
that on one eye I can see that I've just

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.910 
that on one eye I can see that I've just
been<00:04:03.730> had<00:04:03.940> enough<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.240> mirror<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.740> can

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
been had enough in the mirror and I can

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.600 
been had enough in the mirror and I can
see<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.940> indent<00:04:07.740> you<00:04:08.740> can<00:04:08.860> kind<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.340> see

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
see that the indent you can kind of see

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.580 
see that the indent you can kind of see
it<00:04:09.700> from<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:10.000> angle<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.720> looks<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.350> lot

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
it from that angle this looks a lot

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.020 
it from that angle this looks a lot
heavier<00:04:12.240> these<00:04:13.240> this<00:04:13.600> bag<00:04:13.870> here<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:15.030> it's

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
heavier these this bag here and it's

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.340 
heavier these this bag here and it's
definitely<00:04:17.820> smooth<00:04:18.820> my<00:04:19.180> skin<00:04:19.510> out<00:04:19.630> my<00:04:20.019> skin

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
definitely smooth my skin out my skin

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.800 
definitely smooth my skin out my skin
feels<00:04:21.540> tight<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.930> little<00:04:23.080> bit<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:25.210> definitely

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
feels tight a little bit but definitely

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.960 
feels tight a little bit but definitely
there<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.620> definitely<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.280> noticeable

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
there is definitely a noticeable

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.960 
there is definitely a noticeable
improvement<00:04:28.180> under<00:04:28.960> here<00:04:29.650> this<00:04:30.550> doesn't<00:04:30.880> last

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
improvement under here this doesn't last

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.909 
improvement under here this doesn't last
forever<00:04:31.180> it's<00:04:31.810> like<00:04:32.169> sort<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.590> couple<00:04:32.770> of

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
forever it's like sort of a couple of

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.800 
forever it's like sort of a couple of
our<00:04:33.070> thing<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.550> think<00:04:33.790> or<00:04:34.090> no<00:04:34.360> maybe<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.690> bit

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
our thing I think or no maybe a bit

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.420 
our thing I think or no maybe a bit
longer<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.380> think<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.860> sort<00:04:36.040> of<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.250> how

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
longer so I think is it sort of like how

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.950 
longer so I think is it sort of like how
are<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.640> supposed<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.000> use<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.360> like<00:04:37.510> if<00:04:37.630> we<00:04:37.780> go

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
are you supposed to use it like if we go

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.320 
are you supposed to use it like if we go
out<00:04:38.169> but<00:04:38.710> believe<00:04:39.010> that<00:04:39.370> if<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:40.060> need<00:04:40.180> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
out but believe that if you need the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330 
out but believe that if you need the
more<00:04:40.660> often<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.230> use<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.770> yourself<00:04:42.160> you

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
more often that you use it yourself you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.650 
more often that you use it yourself you
train<00:04:42.640> your<00:04:42.850> skin<00:04:43.120> into<00:04:43.800> becoming<00:04:44.800> more<00:04:45.250> tight

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
train your skin into becoming more tight

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.070 
train your skin into becoming more tight
etc<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:47.880> don't<00:04:48.880> know<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.510> exact<00:04:49.810> science

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
etc I don't know the exact science

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.630 
etc I don't know the exact science

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
research if you're worried about it I

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.830 
research if you're worried about it I
just<00:04:53.830> thought<00:04:53.919> it<00:04:54.100> tested<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.640> results<00:04:55.450> for

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
just thought it tested the results for

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.780 
just thought it tested the results for
myself<00:04:56.229> today<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.100> difference<00:04:57.520> and

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
myself today to see the difference and

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.840 
myself today to see the difference and
that<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:58.960> noticeable<00:04:59.830> difference<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:00.760> you

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
that is a noticeable difference so you

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.200 
that is a noticeable difference so you
can<00:05:01.030> see<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.210> get<00:05:01.479> all<00:05:01.600> these<00:05:01.750> lines<00:05:02.140> there<00:05:03.210> they

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
can see I get all these lines there they

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.940 
can see I get all these lines there they
have<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:05.010> decrease<00:05:06.010> slightly

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950
