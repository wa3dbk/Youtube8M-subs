fun<00:00:24.330> video<00:00:24.710> on<00:00:25.710> guitar<00:00:26.130> ramping<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:26.730> kind<00:00:27.360> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
fun video on guitar ramping and kind of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.260 
fun video on guitar ramping and kind of
just<00:00:27.630> make<00:00:28.200> it<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.410> 101<00:00:28.950> type<00:00:29.160> course<00:00:29.490> but

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
just make it a 101 type course but

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.609 
just make it a 101 type course but
should<00:00:30.449> also<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.810> helpful<00:00:31.020> for<00:00:31.289> some<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
should also be helpful for some of you

should also be helpful for some of you
that<00:00:31.770> have<00:00:31.830> heard<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> reamping<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> are

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that have heard of reamping and are

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
that have heard of reamping and are
maybe<00:00:33.360> looking<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.900> incorporate<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> into

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
maybe looking to incorporate it into

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.080 
maybe looking to incorporate it into
your<00:00:34.830> workflows<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> show<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.879> the

your workflows I'm going to show you the
equipment<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> need<00:00:36.980> but<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.220> let's<00:00:38.370> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
equipment you need but first let's just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670 
equipment you need but first let's just
kind<00:00:38.699> of<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.269> reamping<00:00:40.080> is<00:00:40.379> for

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
kind of go over what reamping is for

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.140 
kind of go over what reamping is for
those<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.190> may<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.519> about<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
those of you that may not know about it

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.479 
those of you that may not know about it
reamping<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.199> a<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.620> powerful<00:00:43.860> tool<00:00:44.430> for

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
reamping is a really powerful tool for

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
reamping is a really powerful tool for
engineers<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:45.660> allows<00:00:45.900> us<00:00:46.140> as

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
engineers because it allows us as

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
engineers because it allows us as
engineers<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:47.940> play<00:00:48.089> with<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.360> guitar

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
engineers to go and play with the guitar

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
engineers to go and play with the guitar
tone<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.229> not<00:00:49.769> necessarily<00:00:50.280> worry<00:00:50.610> about

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
tone and not necessarily worry about

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.640 
tone and not necessarily worry about
committing<00:00:51.479> the<00:00:51.629> tone<00:00:51.839> to<00:00:52.049> the<00:00:52.170> hard<00:00:52.379> drive

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
committing the tone to the hard drive

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.590 
committing the tone to the hard drive
when<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.010> first<00:00:53.309> start<00:00:53.519> recording<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.420> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
when we first start recording we just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.780 
when we first start recording we just
record<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.049> direct<00:00:55.440> input<00:00:55.680> signal<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.549> dry

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
record a direct input signal just a dry

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.939 
record a direct input signal just a dry
guitar<00:00:56.850> signal<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.500> keep<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.890> on

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
guitar signal and you can keep that on

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.680 
guitar signal and you can keep that on
hand<00:00:59.339> and<00:00:59.519> then<00:00:59.640> later<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.239> session<00:01:00.449> if

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
hand and then later in the session if

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.180 
hand and then later in the session if
you're<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.930> happy<00:01:01.290> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.739> guitar<00:01:02.040> tone

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
you're not happy with the guitar tone

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
you're not happy with the guitar tone
you<00:01:02.369> printed<00:01:02.790> or<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.570> whatever<00:01:03.809> plugins

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you printed or with whatever plugins

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.299 
you printed or with whatever plugins
you're<00:01:04.379> working<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.220> take

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you're working with then we can take

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
you're working with then we can take
that<00:01:05.519> di<00:01:05.670> signal<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.600> send<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:06.960> from

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that di signal we can send it out from

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960 
that di signal we can send it out from
our<00:01:07.260> DAW<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.220> send<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> back<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.880> our

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
our DAW and we can send it back into our

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
our DAW and we can send it back into our
amplifier<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.320> play<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.590> some

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
amplifier so we can play with some

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.929 
amplifier so we can play with some
native<00:01:10.890> tones<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.310> find<00:01:11.520> something<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
native tones and find something that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
native tones and find something that
maybe<00:01:12.060> sounds<00:01:12.270> better<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> mix<00:01:12.979> so

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
maybe sounds better in the mix so

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.609 
maybe sounds better in the mix so
essentially<00:01:14.610> um<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.810> allows<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.530> more

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
essentially um it just allows for more

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.560 
essentially um it just allows for more
flexibility<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> mix<00:01:17.610> stage<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.120> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
flexibility at the mix stage and it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.330 
flexibility at the mix stage and it
really<00:01:18.750> allows<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.620> find<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.100> tone<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
really allows you to find a tone that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.330 
really allows you to find a tone that
you<00:01:20.580> love<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.210> play<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.390> mic<00:01:21.630> positions

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
you love and to play with mic positions

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.590 
you love and to play with mic positions
different<00:01:23.340> polar<00:01:23.670> patterns<00:01:24.180> different

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
different polar patterns different

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660 
different polar patterns different
amplifiers<00:01:24.930> whatever<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.160> know<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.550> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
amplifiers whatever you know it's just a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.110 
amplifiers whatever you know it's just a
really<00:01:26.700> flexible<00:01:27.410> very<00:01:28.410> powerful<00:01:28.950> way<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.430> get

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
really flexible very powerful way to get

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.920 
really flexible very powerful way to get
good<00:01:30.270> guitar<00:01:30.570> tones

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
good guitar tones

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
good guitar tones
so<00:01:31.380> let's<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.830> ahead<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.250> look<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so let's go ahead and just look at the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
so let's go ahead and just look at the
equipment<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> guys<00:01:33.270> need<00:01:33.480> first<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.080> then

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
equipment you guys need first and then

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
equipment you guys need first and then
we'll<00:01:34.830> get<00:01:34.950> into<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.190> process<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> I'll<00:01:35.850> show

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we'll get into the process and I'll show

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 
we'll get into the process and I'll show
you<00:01:36.060> guys<00:01:36.150> how<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> actually<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:36.990> okay<00:01:37.380> cool

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you guys how to actually do it okay cool

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.040 
you guys how to actually do it okay cool
so<00:01:38.060> obviously<00:01:39.060> enough<00:01:39.300> you<00:01:39.510> guys<00:01:39.690> will<00:01:39.900> need

so obviously enough you guys will need

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.780 
so obviously enough you guys will need
your<00:01:40.200> computer<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.980> DAW<00:01:41.160> software<00:01:41.190> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
your computer your DAW software of

choice we're using Pro Tools here then

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.410 
choice we're using Pro Tools here then
you'll<00:01:44.430> need<00:01:44.550> probably<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> couple<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> cables

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you'll need probably a couple of cables

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
you'll need probably a couple of cables
that<00:01:45.659> may<00:01:45.840> vary<00:01:46.110> depending<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.650> your<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.070> owe

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that may vary depending on your I owe

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
that may vary depending on your I owe
situation<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.840> balanced<00:01:49.230> cables

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
situation I like to have balanced cables

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.290 
situation I like to have balanced cables
if<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> runs<00:01:50.070> are<00:01:50.220> longer<00:01:50.580> than<00:01:50.730> 20<00:01:51.030> feet<00:01:51.150> or

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
if the runs are longer than 20 feet or

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.450 
if the runs are longer than 20 feet or
so<00:01:51.330> just<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.750> prevent<00:01:52.020> adding<00:01:52.800> ground<00:01:53.010> hum<00:01:53.280> or

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so just to prevent adding ground hum or

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
so just to prevent adding ground hum or
signal<00:01:53.790> degradation<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:55.110> you'll<00:01:55.230> need<00:01:55.320> your

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
signal degradation then you'll need your

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
signal degradation then you'll need your
ramp<00:01:55.740> box<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.159> use<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.550> radial<00:01:56.880> Pro<00:01:57.090> RMP<00:01:57.659> which

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
ramp box I use the radial Pro RMP which

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
ramp box I use the radial Pro RMP which
is<00:01:57.930> built<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.290> tank<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.770> affordable<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
is built like a tank it's affordable and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
is built like a tank it's affordable and
it<00:01:59.729> does<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.970> job<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.479> well<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.920> then

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it does this job really well and then

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.370 
it does this job really well and then
you'll<00:02:02.370> obviously<00:02:02.580> need<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.000> microphone<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you'll obviously need a microphone to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840 
you'll obviously need a microphone to
record<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.070> performance<00:02:05.550> from<00:02:05.700> your

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
record the performance from your

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
record the performance from your
amplifier<00:02:06.330> we'll<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:06.960> sm57<00:02:07.290> on

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
amplifier we'll just have an sm57 on

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219 
amplifier we'll just have an sm57 on
there<00:02:08.069> today<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.209> example<00:02:09.599> obviously

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there today for this example obviously

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
there today for this example obviously
your<00:02:10.649> guitar<00:02:10.920> amplifier<00:02:11.280> will<00:02:11.549> be<00:02:11.580> needed<00:02:11.940> as

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
your guitar amplifier will be needed as

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.420 
your guitar amplifier will be needed as
well<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:13.379> take<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> look<00:02:13.799> on<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.099> of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
well so if we take a look on the back of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.800 
well so if we take a look on the back of
my<00:02:14.549> interface<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.069> we've<00:02:17.280> got

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
my interface here you can see we've got

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.080 
my interface here you can see we've got
outputs<00:02:18.810> seven<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:19.560> eight<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.860> available<00:02:20.090> so

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
outputs seven and eight are available so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.170 
outputs seven and eight are available so
we'll<00:02:21.360> go<00:02:21.480> ahead<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> send<00:02:22.790> line<00:02:23.790> output

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
we'll go ahead and send line output

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.979 
we'll go ahead and send line output
number<00:02:24.390> seven<00:02:24.930> out<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.410> my<00:02:25.530> interface

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
number seven out for my interface

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.960 
number seven out for my interface
into<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.650> reamp<00:02:27.980> box<00:02:28.189> so<00:02:28.400> that's<00:02:28.519> where<00:02:28.819> we're

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
into the reamp box so that's where we're

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.640 
into the reamp box so that's where we're
going<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.239> send<00:02:29.480> our<00:02:29.599> di<00:02:29.780> signal<00:02:30.079> out<00:02:30.409> for

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
going to send our di signal out for

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.679 
going to send our di signal out for
reamping<00:02:31.129> is<00:02:31.340> output<00:02:31.760> number<00:02:31.909> seven<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.510> we'll

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
reamping is output number seven so we'll

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.559 
reamping is output number seven so we'll
go<00:02:32.780> ahead<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.989> plug<00:02:33.170> into<00:02:33.349> there<00:02:33.530> now<00:02:33.680> and

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
go ahead and plug into there now and

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.880 
go ahead and plug into there now and
from<00:02:35.569> output<00:02:35.750> number<00:02:36.049> seven<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> other<00:02:36.739> end

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
from output number seven the other end

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.649 
from output number seven the other end
of<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.069> cable<00:02:37.280> will<00:02:37.819> then<00:02:38.030> go<00:02:38.239> into<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
of that cable will then go into the

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.429 
of that cable will then go into the
input<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.379> our<00:02:40.040> reamp<00:02:40.879> box<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.629> then<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
input of our reamp box here and then the

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.160 
input of our reamp box here and then the
output<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.370> reacts<00:02:43.970> I'm<00:02:44.329> just<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:45.109> to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
output of the reacts I'm just going to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.110 
output of the reacts I'm just going to
attach<00:02:45.500> an<00:02:45.709> unbalanced<00:02:46.340> quarter-inch<00:02:46.790> guitar

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
attach an unbalanced quarter-inch guitar

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.690 
attach an unbalanced quarter-inch guitar
instrument<00:02:47.659> cable<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.200> then<00:02:49.069> that's<00:02:49.370> going

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
instrument cable and then that's going

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
instrument cable and then that's going
to<00:02:49.790> go<00:02:49.909> right<00:02:50.120> into<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.420> front<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.629> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
to go right into the front of the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.300 
to go right into the front of the
amplifier<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.439> like<00:02:51.650> if<00:02:51.799> you're<00:02:51.859> plugging<00:02:52.099> a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
amplifier just like if you're plugging a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580 
amplifier just like if you're plugging a
guitar<00:02:52.670> directly<00:02:53.510> into<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.349> amplifier

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
guitar directly into the amplifier

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.390 
guitar directly into the amplifier
itself<00:02:55.189> okay<00:02:55.720> okay<00:02:56.720> guys<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.290> let's<00:02:58.010> just<00:02:58.220> go

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
itself okay okay guys so let's just go

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.550 
itself okay okay guys so let's just go
through<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> scenario<00:02:59.000> here<00:02:59.510> right<00:02:59.690> now<00:02:59.870> so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
through a scenario here right now so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.369 
through a scenario here right now so
10:00<00:03:01.099> on<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.280> client<00:03:01.849> I'm<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.200> your

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
10:00 on the client I'm you I'm your

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.319 
10:00 on the client I'm you I'm your
band<00:03:03.650> your<00:03:03.859> guitar<00:03:04.190> player<00:03:04.489> whoever<00:03:04.909> we're

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
band your guitar player whoever we're

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.000 
band your guitar player whoever we're
just<00:03:05.480> going<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.659> record<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.019> DI<00:03:06.230> track<00:03:06.650> just

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
just going to record a DI track just

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.960 
just going to record a DI track just
using<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.489> plug-in<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:09.019> Pro<00:03:09.290> Tools<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.970> then

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
using a plug-in in Pro Tools and then

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.729 
using a plug-in in Pro Tools and then
I'll<00:03:11.060> show<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.359> how<00:03:11.750> we<00:03:11.810> send<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.349> back<00:03:12.560> out

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
I'll show you how we send that back out

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.530 
I'll show you how we send that back out
to<00:03:12.980> re<00:03:13.159> amp<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.549> then<00:03:13.670> back<00:03:13.879> into<00:03:14.090> Pro<00:03:14.299> Tools

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
to re amp and then back into Pro Tools

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910 
to re amp and then back into Pro Tools
so<00:03:14.780> here's<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.200> first<00:03:15.349> step<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.769> process

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
so here's the first step of the process

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.069 
so here's the first step of the process
that's<00:03:16.700> tracking<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.239> DI<00:03:17.389> guitars<00:03:17.840> this

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
that's tracking the DI guitars this

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.690 
that's tracking the DI guitars this
guitars<00:03:18.409> going<00:03:18.620> direct<00:03:19.010> into<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> preamp

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
guitars going direct into the preamp

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.879 
guitars going direct into the preamp
over<00:03:19.970> here<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:20.930> into<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.260> instrument<00:03:21.500> input

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
over here just into the instrument input

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.379 
over here just into the instrument input
so<00:03:22.010> let's<00:03:22.159> go<00:03:22.280> ahead<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.549> record<00:03:22.639> a<00:03:22.939> take<00:03:23.150> and

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
so let's go ahead and record a take and

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:47.780 
so let's go ahead and record a take and
then<00:03:23.900> we'll<00:03:24.019> send<00:03:24.139> it<00:03:24.260> out<00:03:24.319> for<00:03:24.379> rampion

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.050 

okay<00:03:48.629> so<00:03:49.019> we've<00:03:49.379> recorded<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.890> DI<00:03:50.099> guitar<00:03:50.549> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
okay so we've recorded the DI guitar you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.910 
okay so we've recorded the DI guitar you
can<00:03:51.090> see<00:03:51.450> I've<00:03:51.659> got<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.019> dry<00:03:52.230> signal<00:03:52.290> right

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
can see I've got the dry signal right

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.979 
can see I've got the dry signal right
here<00:03:53.159> in<00:03:53.280> Pro<00:03:53.489> Tools<00:03:53.659> straight<00:03:54.659> in<00:03:54.780> from<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
here in Pro Tools straight in from the

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.649 
here in Pro Tools straight in from the
guitar<00:03:55.260> into<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.620> preamp<00:03:56.120> into<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> DAW

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
guitar into the preamp into the DAW

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.729 
guitar into the preamp into the DAW
so<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:57.959> we're<00:03:58.079> going<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.230> send<00:03:58.439> it<00:03:58.590> out<00:03:58.709> to

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
so now we're going to send it out to

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.830 
so now we're going to send it out to
rehab<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.610> first<00:03:59.879> I'll<00:04:00.120> show<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.360> guys<00:04:00.569> what

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
rehab but first I'll show you guys what

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.899 
rehab but first I'll show you guys what
you<00:04:00.900> need<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.260> do<00:04:01.409> in<00:04:01.530> Pro<00:04:01.709> Tools<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:02.579> get<00:04:02.790> it

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
you need to do in Pro Tools to get it

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.550 
you need to do in Pro Tools to get it
from<00:04:03.030> A<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.209> B<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.720> let's<00:04:03.900> take<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.110> look<00:04:04.379> there

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
from A to B so let's take a look there

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.589 
from A to B so let's take a look there
what<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.890> need<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.129> do<00:04:05.280> okay<00:04:05.459> guys<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.329> here<00:04:06.480> we

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
what you need to do okay guys so here we

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.180 
what you need to do okay guys so here we
are<00:04:06.629> Pro<00:04:06.959> Tools<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.409> can<00:04:07.440> see<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:07.980> we<00:04:08.069> have

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
are Pro Tools you can see that we have

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.680 
are Pro Tools you can see that we have
the<00:04:08.280> dry<00:04:08.459> guitar<00:04:08.519> track<00:04:09.000> which<00:04:09.150> we<00:04:09.299> recorded

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
the dry guitar track which we recorded

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.330 
the dry guitar track which we recorded
to<00:04:09.810> an<00:04:10.049> amplitude<00:04:10.379> for<00:04:10.709> reference<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.220> all

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
to an amplitude for reference it's all

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.460 
to an amplitude for reference it's all
bypassed<00:04:11.790> now<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.239> then<00:04:12.870> we've<00:04:13.019> got<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> ramp

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
bypassed now and then we've got a ramp

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.110 
bypassed now and then we've got a ramp
guitar<00:04:14.010> track<00:04:14.280> which<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:14.519> where<00:04:14.790> we'll<00:04:14.909> print

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
guitar track which is where we'll print

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.580 
guitar track which is where we'll print
to<00:04:15.359> so<00:04:15.750> we're<00:04:15.900> essentially<00:04:16.139> just<00:04:16.260> going<00:04:16.410> to

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
to so we're essentially just going to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.800 
to so we're essentially just going to
create<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.859> loop<00:04:17.100> from<00:04:17.370> Pro<00:04:17.579> Tools<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.510> amps

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
create a loop from Pro Tools to the amps

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.539 
create a loop from Pro Tools to the amps
and<00:04:18.900> back<00:04:19.049> into<00:04:19.289> Pro<00:04:19.470> Tools<00:04:19.680> again<00:04:20.039> and<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.430> you

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
and back into Pro Tools again and if you

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.050 
and back into Pro Tools again and if you
remember<00:04:20.729> we<00:04:21.389> plugged<00:04:21.660> our<00:04:21.810> ramp<00:04:22.109> box<00:04:23.060> into

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
remember we plugged our ramp box into

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.240 
remember we plugged our ramp box into
the<00:04:24.389> output<00:04:24.600> number<00:04:24.960> seven<00:04:25.470> on<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> back<00:04:26.039> of

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the output number seven on the back of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.580 
the output number seven on the back of
my<00:04:26.430> converter<00:04:26.910> box<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:28.169> we're<00:04:28.320> sending

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
my converter box and so we're sending

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.180 
my converter box and so we're sending
our<00:04:29.400> signal<00:04:30.300> out<00:04:30.449> of<00:04:30.600> output<00:04:30.930> number<00:04:31.050> seven<00:04:31.560> to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
our signal out of output number seven to

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.659 
our signal out of output number seven to
the<00:04:33.180> ramp<00:04:33.840> box<00:04:34.080> then<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.860> guitar<00:04:35.220> amp<00:04:35.430> then

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
the ramp box then to the guitar amp then

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.570 
the ramp box then to the guitar amp then
the<00:04:35.760> guitar<00:04:35.910> amp<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.510> going<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.590> play<00:04:37.860> into<00:04:38.430> the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
the guitar amp is going to play into the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.460 
the guitar amp is going to play into the
sm57<00:04:39.090> which<00:04:39.510> is<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.780> turn<00:04:39.960> plugged<00:04:40.289> into

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
sm57 which is in turn plugged into

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.350 
sm57 which is in turn plugged into
analog<00:04:41.100> input<00:04:41.400> number<00:04:41.639> two<00:04:41.820> on<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.030> interface

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
analog input number two on the interface

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.409 
analog input number two on the interface
which<00:04:42.600> is<00:04:43.130> what<00:04:44.130> our<00:04:44.160> ramp<00:04:44.699> channel<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.120> set<00:04:45.300> to

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
which is what our ramp channel is set to

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.120 
which is what our ramp channel is set to
record<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.080> input<00:04:46.470> number<00:04:46.680> two<00:04:46.889> which<00:04:47.100> is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
record to is input number two which is

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.219 
record to is input number two which is
that<00:04:47.370> microphone<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:48.419> we're<00:04:48.750> going<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.020> go

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
that microphone so we're going to go

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.350 
that microphone so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.770> send<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.430> out<00:04:50.639> output<00:04:51.120> number

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
ahead and send this out output number

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.060 
ahead and send this out output number
seven<00:04:51.660> which<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:51.870> where<00:04:52.169> we<00:04:52.289> have<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.889> rear

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
seven which is where we have the rear

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.860 
seven which is where we have the rear
box<00:04:53.280> plugged<00:04:53.550> into<00:04:53.699> okay<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.240> that's<00:04:54.479> physical

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
box plugged into okay so that's physical

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.719 
box plugged into okay so that's physical
output<00:04:55.139> number<00:04:55.229> seven<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.800> we're<00:04:56.550> going<00:04:56.669> to

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
output number seven and we're going to

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.580 
output number seven and we're going to
want<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:56.940> set<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.330> pre<00:04:57.510> fader<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.990> we

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
want to set that the pre fader and we

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.350 
want to set that the pre fader and we
can<00:04:58.830> still<00:04:59.099> adjust<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.550> gain<00:04:59.760> here<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.180> kind

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
can still adjust the gain here to kind

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.300 
can still adjust the gain here to kind
of<00:05:00.389> get<00:05:00.510> hotter<00:05:00.960> or<00:05:01.289> less<00:05:01.500> hot<00:05:01.710> just<00:05:01.919> depending

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
of get hotter or less hot just depending

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.529 
of get hotter or less hot just depending
on<00:05:02.430> your<00:05:02.520> taste<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.000> how<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.150> want<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.449> to

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
on your taste and how you want it to

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.420 
on your taste and how you want it to
sound<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:04.020> kind<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.710> find<00:05:04.889> this<00:05:04.979> is<00:05:05.130> more<00:05:05.310> of<00:05:05.370> a

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
sound I kind of find this is more of a

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.250 
sound I kind of find this is more of a
natural<00:05:05.580> area<00:05:05.970> here<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.389> negative<00:05:06.599> 20<00:05:06.960> DB

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
natural area here in that negative 20 DB

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.750 
natural area here in that negative 20 DB
range<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:07.949> that's<00:05:08.070> we'll<00:05:08.310> leave<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.610> that's

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
range so that's we'll leave it that's

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.480 
range so that's we'll leave it that's
fine<00:05:09.030> for<00:05:09.210> reference<00:05:09.690> so<00:05:10.199> now<00:05:10.440> if<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:10.949> arm<00:05:11.250> this

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
fine for reference so now if I arm this

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.240 
fine for reference so now if I arm this
ramp<00:05:11.760> guitar<00:05:12.060> track<00:05:12.500> for<00:05:13.500> record<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:14.070> will

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
ramp guitar track for record you will

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.389 
thing as an engineer and get the sounds
after<00:06:03.559> you've<00:06:03.830> already<00:06:03.979> got<00:06:04.189> a<00:06:04.219> good

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:04.399 
after you've already got a good

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.059 
after you've already got a good
performance<00:06:04.789> committed<00:06:05.209> to<00:06:05.330> the<00:06:05.479> disk<00:06:05.659> there

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
again yeah it's pretty cheap that radial

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.790 
again yeah it's pretty cheap that radial
box<00:06:08.689> would<00:06:08.929> probably<00:06:09.259> be<00:06:09.349> the<00:06:09.439> only<00:06:09.469> piece<00:06:09.769> of
