00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:29.369 
scared because there's got to be

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:30.949 
scared because there's got to be
something<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:29.849> makes<00:05:30.119> you<00:05:30.239> feel<00:05:30.419> good<00:05:30.659> or<00:05:30.899> at

something that makes you feel good or at

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.269 
something that makes you feel good or at
least<00:05:31.019> make<00:05:31.349> sense<00:05:31.649> of<00:05:31.829> what's<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.099> point
