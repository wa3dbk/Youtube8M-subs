00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.120
 this is apricot bars 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.309
 I kind of like this to me chocolate 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.459
 70 percent dark in ganache 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.520
 al and apricots 500 grams of pasta di 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.160
 candied apricots 150 g of butter 50 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.919
 grams of milk chocolate 25 g of 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.189
 my best cocoa butter 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.070
 let's come then let's learn how we learn 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.650
 this is the 1 degree dark chocolate 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.420
 we merged at 45 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.539
 we also reach 50 degrees if the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.160
 chocolate with a cocoa paste 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.960
 important cocoa paste liquor of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.239
 cocoa for example the big ones are there more 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.590
 perfume today because you didn't say one 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.870
 wrong thing to ask for money 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.789
 you're specializing in the aromas you feel 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.989
 of chocolate when a player or one 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.789
 good good kakà pasta 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.550
 percentage also come out 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.199
 days of perfumes released 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.239
 details that recall precisely 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.719
 his particular training 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.080
 then the type of cocoa itself to gods 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.340
 aromas well selected by companies not 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.740
 I know nothing is left to chance and everything then 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.250
 is exalted again if you cycle 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.780
 it looks better then what i owe 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 to be a teacher now I ask you for a hand 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:25.689
 to clean up the monster effort for a moment 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 it cleans itself as you clean it done 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.000
 on purpose 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.649
 no because other times every time 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.479
 also they run but always the car 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.600
 in fact it would have made the figure I said 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.110
 now another rag but he has 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 need a shop to get my hands 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.000
 ok i'll give you the card thanks next 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.649
 then the other ingredients as totò 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.360
 here we have apricot fruit 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.590
 candied fruits you can use many fruits 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.210
 candied fruit now we have used the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.579
 apricots but the marron glacé yes 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.909
 they lend very well we also have 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.130
 of milk chocolate this circular 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.609
 Milk chocolate not these also the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.770
 if what is this about the rum 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:14.140
 but since you don't like it separately 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.020
 so let's start war quickly 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.210
 what 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.040
 here then that moves you then 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.550
 quickly we give to prepare the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.990
 fingers look good we prepare to 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.640
 our mold that can be precisely 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.280
 this is a soft plastic but 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.950
 normally we can also have some 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.250
 rigid molds simply fill them 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.180
 we totally empty them by doing more for 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.500
 the jaws heat the barrel yes if the ce 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.050
 do in this case since not 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.880
 we therefore have the ganache in this case 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.070
 is a ganache with another type of 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.350
 conductor of flavor in this case the 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.810
 check soap here as you saw it 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.790
 the candied pasta then we combine 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.620
 milk chocolate and cocoa butter e 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.600
 unbelievable how it changes pending sentence or 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.340
 which last created while it is part of 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.140
 stop its very nature therefore not 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.400
 we create traumas by combining the two products 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.540
 we pour them on the candied mass 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.830
 so this case we used 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.650
 apricots but as I told you before 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.600
 we can safely use any 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.270
 we have made the type of scanned fruit 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.310
 pulp in the hovel we pureed and 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.650
 made into puree it really looks almost like one 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.270
 jam is not a jam 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.880
 instead we have now inserted 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.440
 cocoa butter milk chocolate combined 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.120
 together we put them on 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.500
 apricots we used her birth 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.260
 milk because you do not attack it 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.330
 taste of the inhabitants is because we have 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.030
 added cocoa butter because from 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.650
 too strong in this case so if 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.270
 they will help us to solidify 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.810
 or make more 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.490
 and this sort of malleable indeed 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.030
 apricot jam we have 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.220
 prepared 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.000
 Now add the butter is 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.000
 entrusted kindly we pour the butter go 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:08.550
 we mix everything with this melted butter 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.650
 like this in a saucepan we can 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.390
 melt it in the same microwave saucepan 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.580
 the less this does not change the compound is 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.739
 important the emulsion of this type of 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.630
 jaws which is particular because not 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.340
 having solid pan base but in this case it is 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.760
 base and fruit is important that 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.830
 the emulsion takes place with a saucepan 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.110
 with a marisa precisely with not with one 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.720
 whip that would prevent us from 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.470
 figures to analyze them is a lot 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.930
 naturally the chains are nice 2 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.790
 then know them instead if we had 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.250
 used a whip with too much incorporated 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.570
 air in this great counterclockwise gentleman 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.270
 beautiful and also because in question one 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.360
 question of strength we can give in 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.190
 force the mandate yes then I ask you 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.680
 to also pour roma inside is 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:09.510
 our born is ready, we continue 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:12.960
 an emulsion we will be very fast to hear 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.880
 smells we are our sac à poche where it is 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.430
 here it is, I don't have to blow in it 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.680
 following, they made fun of me because 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:26.880
 it blew inside and strange as not 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.290
 I understand why then are the fingers 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.120
 which we have prepared before then 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.970
 when the bottom but there is a temperate 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:38.070
 now we are going to complete them we fill 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.750
 our mold so we will go to 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.540
 get a soft product inside the 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.450
 finger but soft cream we have to 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.790
 however seal with what with del 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.599
 tempered chocolate that the fudge that 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.879
 have tempered before we go to 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.799
 to bend quickly I have prepared 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.119
 while you read someone else for 

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:59.379
 anticipate you because you have to do them 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.679
 however crystallize the butter of 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.779
 cocoa must review but cannot think 

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:08.969
 neck but it will then lend itself to closure 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.969
 which must be made with other chocolate 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.259
 you know now when we finish at 

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:18.419
 studio rush to eat messenger 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:22.539
 12 you have to make it cool or 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:25.419
 crystallize more correctly from 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:28.239
 to explain the temperature change me 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.459
 risk in the possible time but it is probable 

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:32.439
 we keep cocoa butter duct work 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:39.159
 now we also take the ones I have 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:46.649
 anticipated dark chocolate e 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:49.529
 we are going to disconnect these too 

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:52.929
 breaking it we will find the stuffed part 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:57.599
 now I can then see you next 

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:57.599
 week I eat bye bye bye
