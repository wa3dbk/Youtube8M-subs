so what's chicken 65 I grew up eating

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
so what's chicken 65 I grew up eating
this<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.570> India<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.049> never<00:00:16.289> really<00:00:16.560> gave<00:00:16.770> it

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
this in India and I never really gave it

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.160 
this in India and I never really gave it
a<00:00:16.949> thought<00:00:17.190> as<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.029> why<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.480> called<00:00:18.779> chicken

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
a thought as to why it's called chicken

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.500 
a thought as to why it's called chicken
65<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> googled<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.490> some<00:00:21.000> people<00:00:21.029> say

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
65 so I googled it and some people say

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.420 
65 so I googled it and some people say
that<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.590> chicken<00:00:22.980> needs<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.310> be

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that is because the chicken needs to be

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.689 
that is because the chicken needs to be
65<00:00:24.029> days<00:00:24.390> old<00:00:24.800> another<00:00:25.800> person<00:00:26.250> said<00:00:26.460> well

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
65 days old another person said well

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.450 
65 days old another person said well
it's<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:27.449> 65<00:00:28.109> ingredients<00:00:28.460> but

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it's because you use 65 ingredients but

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.040 
it's because you use 65 ingredients but
I<00:00:29.699> don't<00:00:30.000> think<00:00:30.119> any<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> those<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.900> really

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
I don't think any of those are really

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.110 
I don't think any of those are really
true<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:32.099> happened<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
true what really happened is there was a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000 
true what really happened is there was a
canteen<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> India<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> back<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> day<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
canteen in India and back in the day and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.319 
canteen in India and back in the day and
you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.130> when<00:00:35.370> used<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> put<00:00:35.850> those<00:00:36.000> type

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you know when used to put those type

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
you know when used to put those type
walls<00:00:36.600> together<00:00:36.780> they'd<00:00:37.350> actually<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.950> those

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
walls together they'd actually put those

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.069 
walls together they'd actually put those
metal<00:00:38.460> letters<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> when<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.690> actually

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
metal letters and when they actually

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560 
metal letters and when they actually
printed<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.700> numbers<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.149> jumbled

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
printed it the the numbers got jumbled

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.560 
printed it the the numbers got jumbled
up<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.960> became<00:00:43.320> chicken<00:00:44.100> 65<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:45.090> item

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
up and it became chicken 65 not item

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
up and it became chicken 65 not item
number<00:00:45.840> 65<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> story

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
number 65 so I think that's the story

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
number 65 so I think that's the story
I'm<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.780> let's<00:00:49.079> get
