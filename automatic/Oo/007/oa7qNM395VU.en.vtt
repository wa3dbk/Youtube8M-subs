00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.410
 typical of the large millimeter telescope 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.380
 one of the observation tools 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.789
 most powerful astronomical in the world and 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.579
 which is found in the volcano sierra 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.379
 negro in puebla mexico will participate in 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.429
 the most ambitious project in history 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.429
 of astronomy 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.990
 observe a black hole that has 500 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.780
 times the size of our sun that is 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.870
 located in the center of the Milky Way 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.860
 in about a month we are going to do 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.500
 an experiment with the ctm connected to a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.440
 telescope on the south pole a telescope 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.750
 ninet fernet del sur sublime telescope 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.600
 ticos in hawaii between cars 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.660
 submillimeter in the US and others in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.150
 europe the project is part of the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 initiative event horizon telescope that 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.020
 will connect the antennas of the main 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.989
 Millimeter telescopes of the planet 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 to measure the shadow and shape of the hole 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 black in the center of our galaxy 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 called sagittarius 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.170
 the goal is to simulate a huge 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.890
 observatory with a connected antenna 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.380
 between hawaii usa-mexico 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.720
 Antarctica and Europe this way 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 astronomers will look for images to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 through data interpretation 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.110
 statistics of chemical composition 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.300
 of the black hole to know better your 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 shape and size 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.410
 the experiment will perform tests of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 physics and general relativity in one of 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.470
 the most extreme laboratories of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.170
 universe 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.320
 the large millimeter telescope is located 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.240
 at 4600 meters above sea level in 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.150
 the top of the Sierra Negra volcano in 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.680
 populate the purity of heaven offers the 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.120
 perfect conditions for 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.120
 observation of the universe 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.310
 in the depths of the galaxy 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.440
 spiral called milky way a whirlwind 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.140
 of hot matter swirls 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.790
 around a black hole is more than 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.970
 a million times more massive than the sun 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.729
 many galaxies or maybe all contain 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.980
 this monster inside them these 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.350
 supermassive black holes are 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.320
 they keep swallowing stars planets 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.510
 asteroids comets and clouds of gas that 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.180
 they wander near the crowded core 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.549
 galactic 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.849
 the spaceship I like the telescope 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.680
 these nuclear topic of the nasa 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.870
 recently in 2012 he caught the hole 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.099
 central black of the Milky Way when 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.099
 I was having a snack 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.250
 the black hole snacks are a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.010
 violent process in which the food is 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.379
 shattered by powerful tides and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.060
 heated to millions of degrees as 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.709
 that goes down the throat of the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.709
 gravitational singularity 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 something that the dotcom informative agency
