00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.429
 Now we play a piece expand 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.219
 that's it's the opening scene of me 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 It would have brought it that way 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.580
 that is really the entry way 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.830
 Classically my role would be paul temple 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.420
 and you are so graham hawkes the boss 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.920
 from scotland yard as always 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 is desperate because there is a murder 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.760
 series in london of the year 949 and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 nobody knows what to do 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 therefore asked paul temple for advice when 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.610
 ball yes so clever but not in it me 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.809
 I am forward you are forbes we can do so 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.180
 but you can do it that way 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 we want that that's it we can 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.649
 Let's try it over cross 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.510
 read so I am indeed paul temple 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.399
 but you would talk to me and you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm to graham forbes but I would 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.969
 they speak 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.739
 it is also very complicated but how 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.930
 So I do it if you do something then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.820
 not in your way when I clearly shows how lips 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.780
 as a paul temple you speak my voice 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.100
 and the other way its nice experiment 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.449
 that's what they understood midnight 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 we do but we have understood 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.730
 I did not understand it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.110
 so that's why I'm you and me 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:14.280
 You're not exactly what it is when we are 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 pull it black and white 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 Do you know everything is still in it? 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.690
 nachgeguckt made feasible 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.100
 hello also cookbooks and you are so 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
 see it at that time than it soon 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 History is at home at Paul Temple 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.080
 yes, so graham comes from scotland yard and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.140
 tell them what it is right now 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.240
 given bad has nice that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 They do not want to visit again 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.850
 you like a cup of tea or pull it 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
 a whiskey with so close up 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:55.890
 right now I could quite well a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:02:00.110
 whiskey with soda needed in the temple to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.110
 probably for good 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.220
 so now I feel better 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.500
 what does she really have to do with me? 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 home run 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.910
 was the case wally the case 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.100
 five weeks ago on thursday the 12th 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.840
 september disappeared on mysterious 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.250
 wise a girl named barbara valais 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.920
 was not in the newspapers that the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.330
 people by train or wool in seven 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 was discovered by one 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.709
 Norwegian called Peter davis but what 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.660
 was particularly funny two days after 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.120
 Her disappearance received her groom 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.650
 Edward Day by enrolling a small one 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.610
 diamonds industry it was the industry 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.360
 miss wales on the day of the abduction 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.770
 has worn 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.380
 in the industry was a small piece of paper 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.050
 what was written with red ink 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.390
 with the best recommendations of mister 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.209
 gregory with the best recommendations from 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.640
 mystery 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.640
 yes, yes, yes 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.820
 It was fantastic street music love 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.580
 the big question is who is the ominous 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.170
 mister gregory there are up to thousands 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.099
 of suspects and one is and 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.819
 That's the story of the piece 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.160
 madness 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.390
 that is so on this dvd that is 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.390
 the cd cd 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.170
 you know it could be natural that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.819
 it also on DVD one day 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.910
 heavy of these programs like you there 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.290
 in the show if now 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.810
 that is the paradox of this time 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.160
 the meanwhile plays as dvd 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.750
 be recorded on tv 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.739
 be broadcasted so it is and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.299
 conversely one does not know any more 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.519
 yes, I wish you much success that you are 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.069
 and 60s 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.150
 friedrich the whole world cavallis of 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.060
 Mr. know you but also unbelievable 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.680
 good with it though this time still 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.090
 not love at all is right but this 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.620
 radio plays are in the 80s again and again 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.200
 want to repeat and there I am then 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.940
 we are both 82 years old I am 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
 then socialized with it and 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.329
 these stories are in parts like this 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.829
 obscure but still you are at the end 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.479
 still surprised when paul temple 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.370
 At the end in the final cocktail party 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.510
 magic the offender out of the hat i believe 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.940
 it was as asked how are they supposed to 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:34.970
 cd very worth listening to and traveling 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.700
 the colleagues and bastian with this show 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.620
 on the first 13 and 19 in Trier 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.600
 Twentieth in Kaiserslautern and everything 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.320
 more under bastian pastewka de calm 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.320
 exactly 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.960
 the city council had 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 under par in the trend 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.610
 then he is rather nice or 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:30.200
 then he is it is the rs is im 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.910
 eye of the observer now I was called 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.390
 I do not think so out of it 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.190
 make the ladies here in the courtroom is then 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.730
 we have to ask myself then lift the 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:45.110
 hands 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:47.860
 So find the ladies this autumn so 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.860
