00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello welcome one more day does bad hd 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.750
 today I bring you an information that as 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.639
 you see up there in the trick title in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 hot spot or said as you want 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.150
 call it is a trick that I think that 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.799
 nobody knows or that nobody and I have not seen 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.059
 nor to any youtuber to do it nor 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 comment it or anything like that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.880
 they have done it, they have commented on it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.320
 is that as you know it is a way of 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.119
 game type of launch zone in the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 that as you can see they give 200 points for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 enter the barracks or the zone of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 launch in this case to the point 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.449
 hot and what is the trick with the trick 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.250
 is in leaving it is worth leaving the point 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.840
 hot you're worth those who are 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.640
 around here and leave the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.530
 enemy conquer the hot spot worth 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 it seems silly you go for the goal 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 you are going to kill much more so you are going to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.190
 get a lot more streaks and you're going to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.649
 help the team much more you know that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.510
 they give 125 points each time each loss that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.739
 do at the hot spot more than 200 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.260
 catch it you see here that they had taken it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 well now inside again and 200 points 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 again and so on it can 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 do infinite times just that you have 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 to let the enemy take charge 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.589
 who is taking and again 200 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.679
 points you see here 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.320
 every time you do it or to swim 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.750
 those 125 of the low plus 200 of the point 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.789
 hot or be a real asshole 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.710
 authentic savage you have not seen anything 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.689
 that took me out in the ones you're in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 I have not taken almost anything and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.939
 I also have sneaky control today with 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.740
 the msc but that does not matter any weapon 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.209
 just to make it clear to you 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.759
 you have to enter the hot spot 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:32.640
 you know they give you 200 points for entering 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.390
 once in trace let the enemy 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 take that hot spot it's worth taking that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.630
 that barracks you enter what you kill I go to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.670
 give 125 plus 200 for taking again the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.319
 hot spot is a super super way 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.799
 simple to take off streak is very very 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.000
 easy the truth I think I did not want 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.459
 that he was going to pass he thought they were just going to 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.770
 give 200 points once ie once 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.270
 that you had taken the first one no longer 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.459
 they were going to give 200 points or they were going to give 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.349
 the 125 of casualties but the case is that not 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.810
 this is the case is that they give 200 points 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.179
 every time he reconquers so 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.979
 say the hot spot so nothing 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.690
 I hope you liked it I hope that 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.690
 let's be line 11 in the next video
