this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.959> the<00:00:10.139> Ferrari<00:00:11.039> 458<00:00:11.789> Italia<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.900> we've

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
this is the Ferrari 458 Italia and we've

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.049 
this is the Ferrari 458 Italia and we've
come<00:00:13.199> to<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.379> Bedford<00:00:13.709> Auto<00:00:13.860> drom<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.969> the

come to the Bedford Auto drom to the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.810 
come to the Bedford Auto drom to the
west<00:00:15.240> circuit<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
west circuit see what it can do the the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
west circuit see what it can do the the
target<00:00:18.180> time<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:19.140> twenty<00:00:19.440> one<00:00:19.590> seven<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
target time is one twenty one seven and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.670 
target time is one twenty one seven and
I<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.120> set<00:00:21.330> by<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.540> Scuderia<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I was set by the Scuderia and the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
I was set by the Scuderia and the
Ferrari<00:00:22.950> guys<00:00:23.190> are<00:00:23.400> hopeful<00:00:23.700> that<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.940> car

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
Ferrari guys are hopeful that this car

00:00:24.180 --> 00:01:03.660 
Ferrari guys are hopeful that this car
can<00:00:24.330> beat<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.590> let's<00:00:25.770> see<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.220> do

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.910 

so<00:01:04.449> now<00:01:04.600> we're<00:01:04.809> heading<00:01:05.379> out<00:01:05.470> onto<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.800> west

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
so now we're heading out onto the west

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.160 
so now we're heading out onto the west
circuit<00:01:06.400> which<00:01:06.970> we<00:01:07.090> know<00:01:07.240> very<00:01:07.360> well<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.930> car

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
circuit which we know very well in a car

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.050 
circuit which we know very well in a car
that<00:01:08.200> where<00:01:08.470> we're<00:01:09.159> just<00:01:09.190> learning<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:09.760> turned

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
that where we're just learning it turned

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
that where we're just learning it turned
out<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.330> be<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.690> pretty<00:01:11.680> special<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.330> kit

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
out to be a pretty special but a kit

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700 
out to be a pretty special but a kit
much<00:01:15.700> lighter<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.600> handle<00:01:17.409> than<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.560> might

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
much lighter to handle than you might

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.650 
much lighter to handle than you might
expect<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.490> much<00:01:18.729> easier<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:19.210> handle<00:01:19.570> as<00:01:19.630> well

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.600 
with the front and rear grip absolutely
maximized<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.430> that

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
maximized and that was the one that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:59.480 
maximized and that was the one that
delivered<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.270> ultimate<00:02:45.660> lap<00:02:45.810> time<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> we've

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
delivered the ultimate lap time so we've

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.850 
delivered the ultimate lap time so we've
looked<00:02:59.790> at<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> data<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.140> fastest<00:03:01.680> lap

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
looked at the data and the fastest lap

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.700 
looked at the data and the fastest lap
was<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> 120<00:03:03.000> point<00:03:03.360> three<00:03:03.630> which<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.410> pretty

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
was a 120 point three which is pretty

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.530 
was a 120 point three which is pretty
amazing<00:03:04.950> that's<00:03:05.340> just<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.730> tenth<00:03:05.970> slower<00:03:06.360> than

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
amazing that's just a tenth slower than

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.890 
amazing that's just a tenth slower than
a<00:03:06.600> Caterham<00:03:06.990> r500<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.210> almost<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.390> second<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
a Caterham r500 and almost a second and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.420 
a Caterham r500 and almost a second and
a<00:03:09.930> half<00:03:09.960> faster<00:03:10.500> than<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.740> Scuderia<00:03:10.950> managed

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
a half faster than the Scuderia managed

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.500 
a half faster than the Scuderia managed
around<00:03:11.730> here<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.860> pure<00:03:14.370> Road<00:03:15.210> car

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
around here and for a pure Road car

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.070 
around here and for a pure Road car
that's<00:03:16.320> very<00:03:16.710> impressive<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.480> road<00:03:18.480> tyres<00:03:18.780> as

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
that's very impressive on road tyres as

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.630 
that's very impressive on road tyres as
opposed<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> Corsa<00:03:19.950> tyres<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.280> were<00:03:20.460> on<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
opposed to Corsa tyres that were on the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.400 
opposed to Corsa tyres that were on the
Scuderia<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.870> very<00:03:22.530> good<00:03:22.680> lap<00:03:22.890> time<00:03:23.130> indeed
