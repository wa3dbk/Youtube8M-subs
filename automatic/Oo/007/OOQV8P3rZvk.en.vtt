00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.990
 hi all friends today I am a shop 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.760
 frame because without called me 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.000
 to warn me the new has arrived 18 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.279
 140 which we will buy at 18 105 and then 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.290
 finally to a new perspective that we will call 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.050
 today optics hicks and we'll see later which 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.450
 we unpacked the nikon 18 140 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.160
 italcard manuals with Italian warranty 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:42.309
 four-year European guarantee 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:50.980
 and here is the goal then but then 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:53.730
 here we find the lens hood here it is 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 template 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:05.170
 hb 30 dive here it is the same as the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:13.390
 18 140 protection bag lo 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:17.680
 here we put cardboard and here is the 18th 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 105 the first difference we notice between 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.080
 the 18 105 the 18 140 and that of 405 a mount 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.020
 in plastic while 740 metal lovers 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.180
 so we talk a little more resistant 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.400
 of the test shots with 18 105 on 18 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.800
 140 and we will compare them with 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.860
 optics now let's go see the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.229
 shots taken with 18 105 the 18 140 e 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 the hicks perspective that was actually a 50 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.640
 mm 1.8 g 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.630
 we leave immediately with 18 105 to 18 mm the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.890
 fully open diaphragm 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.890
 the image is sharp 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.869
 the focus was made on the here 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:07.950
 ok now 18 140 to 18 mm this too 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:12.750
 very sharp photo diaphragm all open 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.080
 also on 18 140 then 18100 550 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080
 millimeters 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:26.240
 here the depth of field or begins to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:30.500
 reduce and then 18100 40 50 mm to be noted 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.370
 an important thing that on the 18 140 to 50 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.890
 mm 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.110
 we have a maximum aperture 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:45.790
 of f 4.8 while on 18 105 to 50 mm 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:49.360
 we have an aperture of f5 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.280
 then 18 105 to 105 mm 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.099
 here the depth of field is even more 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.359
 reduced but the image remains clear where 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.359
 the focus was made 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.840
 1840 to 140 mm almost the same thing 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.970
 now let's look at these other two shots 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.580
 this shot was made or 18 105 al 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.250
 18 mm and we look a little in the corners 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.950
 what happens here these black dots 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.690
 present on the ceiling begin to 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.810
 become a bit confused I am not 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:36.020
 perfectly sharp instead on the 18 140 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.069
 in the corners the sharpness seems to be 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.069
 higher 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.060
 also on the right here we review the image 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.780
 taken with 18 105 and actually 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.320
 that with 18 140 seems to be more 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.170
 sharp now let's look at two more 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.900
 pictures taken this time with 50 mm 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:11.030
 1.8 g this here that we now open 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:16.940
 taken at diaphragm f 5 then as on 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.400
 18 105 50 mm but the 50 mm 1.8 g gives us 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.140
 a superior sharpness as we know 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.230
 that lenses with focal length 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.520
 fixed they are always a bit sharper 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.520
 of the zoom lenses 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.580
 then 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.710
 last image taken with 50 mm 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.340
 this time at full aperture then 1.8 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.939
 and see how the image remains anyway 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.620
 very clear therefore 50 mm premium 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:51.360
 1.8 really behaves really well 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.509
 summarize the things we have said in 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.780
 this video on 18,140 actually 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.060
 sharper than 18 105 the 18 105 pro ha 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.759
 a lower cost and never forget 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.710
 to buy at least a 50 mm than over 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.500
 to offer you really sharpness 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.990
 high having for all diaphragm 1814 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.659
 can be useful in poor conditions 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.250
 light and everything after teased almost worth 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.250
 beds by frame it
