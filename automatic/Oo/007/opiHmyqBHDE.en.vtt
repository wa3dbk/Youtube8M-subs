assembles we take our camera mount and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.739 
assembles we take our camera mount and
we'll<00:00:57.309> lock<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.519> down<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.089> you'll<00:00:58.570> notice

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
we'll lock it down and you'll notice

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.750 
we'll lock it down and you'll notice
that<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.109> camera<00:00:59.320> map<00:00:59.649> has<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.129> little<00:01:00.519> coin

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
that the camera map has a little coin

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.270 
that the camera map has a little coin
screw<00:01:01.089> there<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.989> allows<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.949> remove

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
screw there that allows you to remove

screw there that allows you to remove
the<00:01:03.489> camera<00:01:03.879> piece<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.590> don't<00:01:05.740> have

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the camera piece so that you don't have

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.860 
the camera piece so that you don't have
to<00:01:06.010> disassemble<00:01:06.640> everything<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.270> then<00:01:07.750> you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
to disassemble everything and then you

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.400 
to disassemble everything and then you
can<00:01:08.050> mount<00:01:08.230> that<00:01:08.320> back<00:01:08.680> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.390> rods<00:01:10.660> these

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
can mount that back on the rods these

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.600 
can mount that back on the rods these
are<00:01:11.620> industry<00:01:12.220> standard<00:01:12.700> 15<00:01:13.120> millimeter<00:01:13.600> rods

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
are industry standard 15 millimeter rods

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.810 
are industry standard 15 millimeter rods
the<00:01:15.610> locking<00:01:16.830> wing<00:01:17.830> tabs<00:01:18.790> here<00:01:19.270> or<00:01:19.450> claw<00:01:20.350> cable

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the locking wing tabs here or claw cable

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.450 
the locking wing tabs here or claw cable
just<00:01:21.820> like<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.360> higher<00:01:22.870> priced<00:01:23.380> units<00:01:23.830> so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
just like on the higher priced units so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.560 
just like on the higher priced units so
you<00:01:24.520> never<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.000> worry<00:01:25.180> about<00:01:25.270> them<00:01:25.540> in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
you never have to worry about them in

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.930 
you never have to worry about them in
pinching<00:01:26.260> on<00:01:26.410> a<00:01:26.920> camera<00:01:27.400> body<00:01:27.610> or<00:01:27.850> an

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
pinching on a camera body or an

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
pinching on a camera body or an
accessory<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.740> then<00:01:29.920> mount<00:01:30.190> your<00:01:31.560> follow

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
accessory you then mount your follow

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.500 
accessory you then mount your follow
focus<00:01:32.920> onto<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:34.060> rods<00:01:36.060> you'll<00:01:37.060> notice<00:01:37.360> that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
focus onto the rods you'll notice that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.420 
focus onto the rods you'll notice that
the<00:01:37.630> follow<00:01:37.870> focus<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:38.410> mounted<00:01:38.800> on<00:01:38.920> an<00:01:39.040> angle

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
the follow focus is mounted on an angle

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.000 
the follow focus is mounted on an angle
what<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.330> does<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.870> allows<00:01:40.900> this<00:01:41.470> rubber

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
what this does is it allows this rubber

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.160 
what this does is it allows this rubber
friction<00:01:42.460> ring<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.850> contact<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.510> focus<00:01:43.960> ring

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
friction ring to contact the focus ring

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.980 
friction ring to contact the focus ring
on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.440> lens<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.360> thereby<00:01:46.360> eliminate<00:01:46.870> the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
on the lens and thereby eliminate the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.710 
on the lens and thereby eliminate the
need<00:01:47.170> for<00:01:47.440> any<00:01:47.920> lens<00:01:48.220> gears<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:49.390> allows

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
need for any lens gears this allows

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.880 
need for any lens gears this allows
quick<00:01:50.020> setup<00:01:50.410> and<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:52.150> lens<00:01:52.360> follow<00:01:53.230> focus<00:01:53.530> is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
quick setup and the lens follow focus is

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.160 
quick setup and the lens follow focus is
also<00:01:54.610> marked<00:01:55.470> 180<00:01:56.470> degrees<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:58.180> also<00:01:58.450> put

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
also marked 180 degrees you can also put

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.770 
also marked 180 degrees you can also put
your<00:01:59.320> own<00:01:59.500> marks<00:01:59.920> on<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.730> body<00:02:00.940> with<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.540> grease

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780

pencil and put your focus pull marks

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.010 
pencil and put your focus pull marks
wherever<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.940> deem<00:02:10.929> them<00:02:11.170> necessary<00:02:13.020> there's

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
wherever you deem them necessary there's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.100 
wherever you deem them necessary there's
also<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.470> industry<00:02:15.250> standard<00:02:15.730> size<00:02:15.910> square

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
also a industry standard size square

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.190 
also a industry standard size square
for<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.650> use<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> crank<00:02:18.430> or<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> whip<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
for the use with a crank or a whip and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.600 
for the use with a crank or a whip and
all<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.380> all<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:22.060> total<00:02:22.240> assembly<00:02:22.840> time<00:02:23.610> is

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
all in all the total assembly time is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.080 
all in all the total assembly time is
under<00:02:24.970> 30<00:02:25.240> seconds<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.950> here<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> 7d

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
