00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.910
 the franchise made in Finland by network 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.110
 links that started making fire from 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.110
 flash in the year 2000 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.130
 but it was only in 2009 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.130
 in consoles 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.420
 on Sunday would let us bring 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.700
 evolution that is so far my favorite 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.260
 of the whole series but today we're going to see in 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.670
 the last delivery that has left for 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.590
 next generation consoles including 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.660
 the Cuban team and the playstation 4 and 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.710
 let's see if it exceeds its predecessors or 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.450
 it is simply more of the same 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 the essential formula has not changed much 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 in each level you get on a motorcycle and you must 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.140
 go through a succession of obstacles 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 jumping or giving crazy pirouettes the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 physics of the world and see how your pilot will 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 take out the dirt every time you fail is 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.750
 essential part of the fun and believe me 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.090
 that will fall over and over and over and over and over and over 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.500
 again but every time you fall 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.180
 you learn and in the end you finish 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.009
 perfecting your technique until 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.620
 you get a perfect game by getting 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.570
 a gold or platinum medal 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.280
 then you must beat the record of your 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.620
 friends and the people around the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 world this creates a huge incentive for 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.000
 re play each level and establish a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 unbeatable time this time there is a little 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.330
 It varies over vehicle including by 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 first time a four-wheel drive and a 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.200
 mountain bike everyone has a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.910
 particular behavior and it's a 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220
 true challenge to control the 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.320
 most advanced vehicles the first 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.180
 levels are pretty simple until 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.460
 they teach you how to do the boni hop here 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 where I really think you put a job 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.180
 ultra difficult 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.660
 is that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.580
 to advanced levels are 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.490
 ruthlessly difficult that has me 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.770
 to balance your broker I bet you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.220
 that are going to take many and many and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.220
 many times 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.780
 but part of the fun is not 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.049
 fall and at the beginning like that in this 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.049
 moment 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.410
 and then you can play with your pilot in the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.890
 graphic 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.450
 obama does not want the school not to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.520
 uy wants to ride bike 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.270
 until after many 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.270
 Attempts 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.740
 until after many attempts by 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.720
 you do it 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.550
 at 8 o'clock 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.650
 geographic are the most spectacular 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.170
 of the series and there are some scenarios that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.880
 they are simply majestic the way 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.950
 multiplayer returns with action to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.020
 four players at the local level which 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.430
 it's a very good additional minigame but 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.560
 I would have liked to see some new 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.599
 game modes 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.340
 the futuristic tone did not convince me 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.290
 all the levels that I liked the most 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.760
 were those that resembled the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.170
 previous games and they felt more 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 earthly 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.470
 I did not like the challenges either 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.390
 individual or acrobatics since 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.880
 some feel a bit forced 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.459
 I also saw several texture errors each 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.050
 Once a level began happily 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.790
 essential traction mechanics follows 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.120
 being very entertaining and adrenaline 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.680
 what it provides is efficient because it will take 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.599
 about six hours finish all the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.069
 levels but to get each of 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.590
 gold medals could pass 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.450
 weeks this added to the level editor 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.370
 and to the new packages of worlds that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.340
 will come soon guarantees you that 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.930
 they will continue hired for a good time 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.220
 I liked quite a trail your vision 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.080
 but this is my suggestion for those who 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.090
 they just start in the low franchise 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.590
 in the game that was on iphone and ipads 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.410
 which is called transfronterer which is very 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.209
 well and above it's free and if you've already played 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.099
 all that and they want very nice graphics 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.720
 they go to play transfusion with which they 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.370
 they will have a lot of fun is also very 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.019
 likely to end up hurting read the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.880
 thumbs after playing it but every 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.560
 once you pass a level in which you 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.970
 I was stuck for days and bats at 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.540
 record of your friends 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.540
 amazing 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.740
 and doing this is like singing 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.740
 it's like a nicholas mouth but with motorcycles
