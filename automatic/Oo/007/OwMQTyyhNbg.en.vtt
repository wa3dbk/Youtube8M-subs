 important foreign company in our 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.850
 medium but suddenly decided why not 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.800
 I'm going to have my business so I audi 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.019
 that such welcome as the migration 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.449
 allows management studies 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.220
 yes this administration and my partner 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.290
 also study minister judged 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.049
 While the Pacific has my partner in the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.380
 of Lima because we were friends for 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.120
 time and we said we want to use joint 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.470
 just the two of us were doing 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.420
 our businessmen that is the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.520
 project to finish the university and 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.150
 finished sixth and we got together and we have to 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.600
 we got together and we were almost a 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.010
 year doing the business plan e 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 investigating things because we did already 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.460
 we want to know how to at this moment 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.350
 it was super cool everybody was doing 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.200
 clothes then a couple of different 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.080
 shoes almost nothing of art and we started 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.540
 well make very imperfect wool shoes 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.020
 and tell me how they started is what was the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.790
 cross the beginning of this we start in 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 truth as they are more or less big 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.600
 we started with a store in 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.670
 front conquerors you did not start 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.100
 as they are sometimes they make us warn them 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.229
 to the friends who sell it in your house 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.260
 that we do not start the children 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.630
 they have conquerors that we made 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.450
 I'll start like this we happily had the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.270
 opportunity and well I think that we do 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.740
 it helped a lot that people know us 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 very good then and suddenly and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.400
 only at a point of sale and then 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.040
 as we see the growth of the company 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.800
 in May of this year we already fulfilled four 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.660
 years in the beginning we started in this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.960
 shop in conquerors we were there 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.270
 for three years for a subject with the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.010
 rent and this we had to leave and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
 good to go down in another opportunity and the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.700
 alternative search we enter to know what 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.670
 It's a designer shop 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.340
 independent we have a wall with 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.800
 our logo that is for us 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.780
 nothing more and we are there in April 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 Now we are opening a new one in 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 atomic that is in conquerors and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.230
 We are testing in our new type 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.270
 of business like we want also we 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.120
 I would like to look for a flavor and go back to 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.590
 open something our perfect clear apart 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.150
 now tell me a little about the subject 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.760
 of the shoes you have studied 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 design occurs to them in designs what 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.610
 they take it from another side like they do in 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.890
 reality none 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.710
 I study design but we like it a lot 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.020
 fashion we are inspired a lot what 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.100
 good thing is that here Lima comes almost 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.540
 always a whole year later and then 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.840
 now with the ease of I do not know the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.120
 blogs internet magazines and everything 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.950
 that's easy to know what are the things that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.690
 are very going to come then in 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.250
 actually we rely on times not to see the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.380
 things that are going to be fashionable things that 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.910
 We believe that we can adapt 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.340
 we try to make our shoes that 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.209
 be shoes that you can use any 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.340
 girl but give them one more touch not for 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.800
 example I do not know this is a shoe that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.230
 you can use to exit or it's a 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.270
 black shoe 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.840
 classic but we put the golden one not the 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.960
 small details 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.570
 totally black but we 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.430
 we focus a lot on the correct cue 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.620
 in the form of platform that is like that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.930
 that you use them more 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.840
 we also have options like 'animal 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.460
 print 'a little more daring are the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.890
 these loafers that are super trendy 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.320
 with a little detail that are super happy 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.330
 and we care a lot about accumulating 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.120
 Christmas for example these are not super 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.530
 comfortable the platforms that we use are 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.630
 understood by the detail tell the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.280
 heel details yes it feels 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.870
 also the heel we try to give them 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.460
 detallitos suddenly on shoes 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.380
 things differentiate the product 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.630
 Any girl is your product the key 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.480
 and it is the differentiation yes but not a 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.190
 differentiation as a shoe 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.320
 catwalk that you can not use always not 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.360
 is a differentiation that is that 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.280
 really any girl can use it 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.410
 no but they still have only this in mind 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.480
 is the same part in another side if it is 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.160
 because it could be the mind this model 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.530
 with that color find it in another brand 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.970
 It is not true if we try to give you a certain 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.680
 little details and that's how I had a 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.810
 simply the waiter tried 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.700
 pass details of the platform 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.680
 special for that shoe and try to 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.750
 do this kind of thing perfect for 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.480
 tell me a little about this topic the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.280
 women that age range the truth 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.700
 we have had everything we have had since 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.260
 girls that come because they have 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.060
 fifteen year old gentlemen who come to 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.480
 buy shoes not our range 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.440
 main is between I think that 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.290
 twenty-something and thirty-some years 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.120
 but we have everything perfect and how many 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.210
 collections per year we do not do it so 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.500
 great is one that is the one we throw out 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.690
 winter that leaves at the end of April and 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.820
 early May and the summer 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.920
 it leaves at the end of October more or less and 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.930
 inside those are the big ones and then 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.260
 we are taking little ones during the rest 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.240
 of the year 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.910
 together shoes with two pairs of shoes 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.940
 more or less you sell in a month and in a 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.570
 finishing season depends but in a 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.030
 average can be about 100 pairs per month 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.530
 well more or less and the average price of 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.170
 your shoes reference but less but 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:28.360
 the frame the example in summer have been 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.840
 between 290 and 250 soles and 380 soles and 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.889
 now in 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.780
 before 299 soles to 480 soles more or 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.660
 less as they use social networks to 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.160
 put the truth that we are pretty 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.750
 right now on our website is in 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.000
 construction we have always had 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.550
 loans with some improvements we use 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.010
 facebook we have almost 24 thousand 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.229
 fans there we also use twitter and we use 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.120
 recently pinter is that we finish it 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.000
 to open as well so that those 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.100
 followers become buyers 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.169
 The truth is that we hung a lot of 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.139
 things we try to give ideas of how to use 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.150
 the shoes 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.099
 we always update that is the new one that 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.319
 is coming to the store what colors 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.969
 how could they be used and I think those are 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.300
 things that clients value a lot 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.069
 the tips and we try to give advice 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.990
 especially how to use them I do not think that 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.789
 that sometimes changes the image of when 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.789
 it's an envelope on a shoe and how could you 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.289
