I go students are going to a

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.360 
I go students are going to a
supernatural<00:00:58.540> school<00:00:58.960> their<00:00:59.530> churches<00:01:00.190> are

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
supernatural school their churches are

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.930 
supernatural school their churches are
training<00:01:01.000> them<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.840> reach<00:01:02.350> out<00:01:02.590> of<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.430> walls

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
training them to reach out of the walls

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.490 
training them to reach out of the walls
of<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.239> church<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.780> actually<00:01:05.140> touch

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
of the church and actually touch

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.190 
of the church and actually touch
darkness<00:01:06.310> yeah<00:01:06.670> yeah<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.689> think<00:01:07.960> that

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
darkness yeah yeah and so I think that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320 
darkness yeah yeah and so I think that
that's<00:01:08.649> you<00:01:09.040> know<00:01:09.070> that's<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.520> phenomena<00:01:10.150> that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
that's you know that's a phenomena that

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.719 
that's you know that's a phenomena that
will<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.659> written<00:01:11.470> about<00:01:11.680> 100<00:01:12.340> years<00:01:12.520> from<00:01:12.640> now

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
will be written about 100 years from now

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.330 
will be written about 100 years from now
in<00:01:13.060> history<00:01:13.479> they'll<00:01:13.659> say<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:14.590> know<00:01:14.619> they

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
in history they'll say you know they

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.570 
in history they'll say you know they
will<00:01:15.520> talk<00:01:15.790> about<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.240> season<00:01:16.650> where<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:18.010> the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
will talk about this season where it the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.899 
will talk about this season where it the
where<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.869> went<00:01:20.110> from<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.860> clergy<00:01:21.220> doing<00:01:21.790> the

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
where it went from the clergy doing the

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.570 
where it went from the clergy doing the
ministry<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:23.290> Saints<00:01:23.710> actually<00:01:24.310> being

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
ministry to the Saints actually being

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.539 
ministry to the Saints actually being
empowered<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:26.140> minister<00:01:26.770> outside<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.369> walls

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
empowered to minister outside the walls

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.340 
empowered to minister outside the walls
of<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.729> churches<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.869> think<00:01:29.140> that's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
of the churches and so I think that's

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.560 
of the churches and so I think that's
not<00:01:29.770> so<00:01:29.920> much<00:01:30.070> prophetic<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:30.760> it<00:01:30.880> is<00:01:31.000> obvious

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
not so much prophetic as it is obvious

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.200 
not so much prophetic as it is obvious
yeah<00:01:31.900> but<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.650> think<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.340> do<00:01:33.759> think<00:01:34.090> it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
yeah but I think it's I do think it's

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.960 
yeah but I think it's I do think it's
profound<00:01:34.630> yeah<00:01:35.470> um<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.340> other<00:01:36.430> thing<00:01:36.549> I<00:01:36.850> think

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
profound yeah um the other thing I think

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.179 
profound yeah um the other thing I think
that<00:01:37.240> it's<00:01:37.689> probably<00:01:37.960> you're<00:01:38.710> gonna<00:01:38.830> need<00:01:39.070> to

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
that it's probably you're gonna need to

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.969 
that it's probably you're gonna need to
be<00:01:39.280> tested<00:01:39.850> but<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.210> think<00:01:41.020> we're<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.530> time<00:01:41.770> of

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
be tested but I think we're in a time of

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.300 
be tested but I think we're in a time of
unprecedented<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:44.140> were<00:01:44.259> talking<00:01:44.710> today<00:01:44.830> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
unprecedented I were talking today and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.980 
unprecedented I were talking today and
we<00:01:45.790> don't<00:01:46.180> know<00:01:46.270> when<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.540> is<00:01:46.689> going<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.900> be

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
we don't know when this is going to be

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.520 
we don't know when this is going to be
shown<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.490> know<00:01:48.610> Israel<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:50.049> another

fifty years from now

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.480 
fifty years from now
the<00:05:27.300> idea<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:28.050> war<00:05:28.320> although<00:05:28.620> there<00:05:29.010> will

statistic is like 70% that smoking has

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.830 
statistic is like 70% that smoking has
dropped<00:06:17.160> by<00:06:17.370> more<00:06:17.400> than<00:06:17.700> 70<00:06:18.300> percent<00:06:18.450> in<00:06:18.750> the

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
last 20 years so what's happened I'm not

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.960 
last 20 years so what's happened I'm not
saying<00:06:22.110> that<00:06:22.200> Wars<00:06:22.680> going<00:06:22.950> away<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.550> don't<00:06:23.730> I'm

not saying no one's ever gonna have

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.190 
not saying no one's ever gonna have
conflict<00:06:25.770> right<00:06:25.890> I'm<00:06:26.669> saying<00:06:27.060> the<00:06:27.360> concept

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
conflict right I'm saying the concept

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.130 
conflict right I'm saying the concept
that<00:06:28.380> we<00:06:28.500> solve<00:06:29.010> our<00:06:29.160> conflicts<00:06:30.140> through

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
that we solve our conflicts through

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.000 
that we solve our conflicts through
weapons<00:06:31.830> and<00:06:32.280> killing<00:06:32.730> each<00:06:32.850> other<00:06:33.470> will<00:06:34.470> will

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
weapons and killing each other will will

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.520 
weapons and killing each other will will
be<00:06:35.160> will<00:06:35.490> be<00:06:35.760> seen<00:06:36.120> by<00:06:36.450> most<00:06:36.810> of<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.110> world<00:06:37.290> is

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
be will be seen by most of the world is

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.730 
be will be seen by most of the world is
barbaric<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:38.790> will<00:06:39.720> be<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.289> will<00:06:40.500> be<00:06:40.590> an

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
barbaric and will be it will be an

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.330 
barbaric and will be it will be an
outdated<00:06:41.190> way<00:06:41.550> to<00:06:41.610> solve<00:06:41.970> conflict<00:06:42.570> and<00:06:43.289> so<00:06:43.770> I

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
outdated way to solve conflict and so I

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.740 
outdated way to solve conflict and so I
think<00:06:44.760> that's<00:06:44.940> that's

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
think that's that's

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.810 
think that's that's
huge<00:06:46.080> prophecy<00:06:46.590> but<00:06:46.710> it's<00:06:46.830> also<00:06:47.070> backed<00:06:47.460> up<00:06:47.640> by

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
huge prophecy but it's also backed up by

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.900 
huge prophecy but it's also backed up by
Scripture<00:06:48.270> yeah<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:49.260> so<00:06:49.800> I<00:06:49.830> see<00:06:50.460> us<00:06:50.610> moving

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
Scripture yeah and so I see us moving

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.530 
Scripture yeah and so I see us moving
into<00:06:51.240> into<00:06:51.960> that<00:06:51.990> into<00:06:52.950> that<00:06:52.980> realm<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:54.180> it's

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
into into that into that realm and it's

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.660 
into into that into that realm and it's
it's<00:06:54.840> actually<00:06:55.260> pretty<00:06:55.440> exciting<00:06:55.920> to<00:06:56.070> be<00:06:56.250> yeah

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670
