I don't have class today so I'm going to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.290 
I don't have class today so I'm going to
use<00:04:00.020> this<00:04:00.140> plastic<00:04:00.350> right<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:01.340> just<00:04:02.000> pour<00:04:02.210> it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
use this plastic right and just pour it

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:17.979 
use this plastic right and just pour it
in<00:04:15.040> now<00:04:16.040> this<00:04:16.220> should<00:04:16.430> take<00:04:16.730> probably<00:04:17.359> up<00:04:17.780> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
in now this should take probably up to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.720 
in now this should take probably up to
about<00:04:18.140> five<00:04:18.440> hours<00:04:18.710> to<00:04:18.950> freeze<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.670> a

and replicate the ice cream maker is
I'll<00:04:26.870> cool<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.260> mixture<00:04:27.440> at<00:04:27.800> every<00:04:28.280> hour<00:04:28.430> just

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
I'll cool the mixture at every hour just

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.990

to start up air rights a little bit

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.650 
to start up air rights a little bit
obviously

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
obviously

you would in an ice cream maker but it

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:44.230 
you would in an ice cream maker but it
prevents<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.210> from<00:04:38.300> becoming<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.990> see<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:43.240> there

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
prevents it from becoming I see so there

00:04:44.240 --> 00:05:08.560 
prevents it from becoming I see so there
is<00:04:44.450> your<00:04:44.690> ice<00:04:44.840> cream<00:04:45.200> mixture<00:05:07.330> couple<00:05:08.330> days

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
ago for my mom I think she's into it a

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.700 
ago for my mom I think she's into it a
little<00:05:12.410> bit

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
little bit

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.380 
little bit
I've<00:05:12.950> had<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.250> sitting<00:05:13.430> out<00:05:13.640> for<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:14.000> half<00:05:14.240> an

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
I've had it sitting out for that half an

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.450 
I've had it sitting out for that half an
hour<00:05:14.540> I<00:05:14.690> just<00:05:14.960> saw<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.440> becomes<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.340> little

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
hour I just saw that it becomes a little

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.650 
hour I just saw that it becomes a little
bit<00:05:16.580> easier<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:17.270> manage<00:05:19.090> I'm<00:05:20.090> not<00:05:20.270> sure<00:05:20.480> if<00:05:20.540> you

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
bit easier to manage I'm not sure if you

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.990 
bit easier to manage I'm not sure if you
can<00:05:20.810> see<00:05:21.080> that

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.240 

pretty<00:05:29.690> much

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.160 

so<00:05:38.250> there<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.610> have<00:05:38.670> raw<00:05:39.360> vegan<00:05:39.930> chocolate

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.710 
so there you have raw vegan chocolate
ice<00:05:40.560> cream<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:41.730> make<00:05:41.910> different<00:05:42.150> versions

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
to maybe give a try so they have raw

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.800
