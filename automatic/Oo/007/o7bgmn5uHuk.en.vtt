00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I figured since I have these I should at

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
I figured since I have these I should at
least<00:00:48.750> open<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.289> they've<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:50.280> been

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
least open them they've only been

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.400 
least open them they've only been
sitting<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.300> months<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:51.629> and

sitting around for two months now and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.650 
sitting around for two months now and
then<00:00:52.770> hopefully<00:00:53.100> once<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:53.879> opened<00:00:54.420> we

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
then hopefully once these are opened we

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
then hopefully once these are opened we
get<00:00:54.780> back<00:00:54.930> into<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> swing<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> things<00:00:55.590> get
