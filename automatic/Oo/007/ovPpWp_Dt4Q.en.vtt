00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.990
 if not to god 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.030

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.370
 fuck Mr. Lieutenant we went out 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.060
 from the central and in constant contact 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.390
 radio 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.690
 we took the provincial road at km 41 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.190
 taken the roadman's house well hidden 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.260
 our cars 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.930
 if they saw that there is not and we have 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.650
 mounted speed cameras is made without fines 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 pity to those who passed over 50 were 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 even 50 cities are taken without a license 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.210
 fuck Mr. Lieutenant was hot 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.080
 that if the provincial burned it seemed 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.940
 an oven that had flickering asphalt 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.160
 inspirational the whole background and it is so 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.140
 we all got sweaty about that 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.210
 trouble of those dead boys 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.180
 killed in the air like one 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.460
 rag studies on the ground like people who 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.350
 they broke up with the explosive that 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.780
 if you don't need it for good things 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.380
 it can become so bad and after how much 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.909
 nothing remains, the lieutenant we are here 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.579
 with these uniforms 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.350
 that many times there are close species 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.720
 since they are de lise 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.850
 from a joke humor and we are 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.040
 tired of enduring what happens 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.290
 in this country where we have to go 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.080
 to kill for just over a million per 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.450
 month and there is a thing here in the gorge that 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.480
 just don't go down and get it down 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.110
 a word if someone kills himself takes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.670
 more than what peace takes 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 fuck sir, l know you am 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 talking to the commander but how long 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.780
 will have to pass to sit on one 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.300
 flying the voice to the various makes us tremble 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.459
 that courage you that we have so much but here 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.000
 it gets harder and harder when it touches us 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.830
 come to terms with the courage of fear 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.350
 that this is what happens now 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.959
 and then if there is an urgent call yes 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.760
 takes where one goes the same excluded 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.580
 so much if it's nothing and to lieutenant 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.950
 so if you think that twenty years I believe 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.180
 that just does not blame me if he can 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.610
 put yourself in my shoes 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.790
 maybe I don't want to hear from him and tell him 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.790
 sincerely that the lieutenant 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.959
 we take the opportunity to make a round of applause a 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.409
 all law enforcement agencies pause 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.409
 strong 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.980

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.980
 the former we now have a
