opportunity<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.510> spray<00:00:39.840> downs<00:00:40.129> know<00:00:41.129> whether

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
opportunity for spray downs know whether

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.670 
opportunity for spray downs know whether
it'll<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.149> slightly<00:00:42.809> harder<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> defend

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it'll make it slightly harder to defend

it'll make it slightly harder to defend
or<00:00:44.670> easy<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> guess<00:00:45.120> we'll<00:00:45.390> find<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
or easy I guess we'll find out this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
or easy I guess we'll find out this

projector<00:01:21.630> ease<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> mean<00:01:22.400> they<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.580> follow<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
projector ease I mean they now follow a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
projector ease I mean they now follow a
different<00:01:24.509> path<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.080> believe<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> air<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
different path I believe in the air and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.230 
different path I believe in the air and
the<00:01:26.340> volume<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> smoke<00:01:27.650> films<00:01:29.240> filled

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the volume of the smoke films filled

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.789 
the volume of the smoke films filled
spaces<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:31.020> differently<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
spaces a little differently I think it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
spaces a little differently I think it
glitches<00:01:32.369> less<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:33.600> wolves<00:01:34.049> etcetera

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
glitches less through wolves etcetera

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
glitches less through wolves etcetera
now<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> can't<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.299> them

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
now so you can't really and be use them

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
now so you can't really and be use them
as<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.650> could<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.549> to
