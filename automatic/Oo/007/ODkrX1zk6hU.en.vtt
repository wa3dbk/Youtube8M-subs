00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.990

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.990
 all 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.210
 as vice 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.930
 in my case it's something complex so 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.930
 let's leave it 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.579
 and also 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.930
 and technically 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.170
 After an hour you can go to the bathroom 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.170
 walk 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.399

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.600
 lying down 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 get up completely 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.890
 of marten 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 because you feel like to change 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.329
 that at least happened in 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.020
 24 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.090
 capitalization 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.090
 but 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390
 two 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.180
 something very difficult 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.480
 in pavilion and nothing 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.370
 party 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.830

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.170

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.170
