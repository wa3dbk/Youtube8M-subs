that really want the thinnest slimmest
and<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.349> case<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and like this case the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.460 
and like this case the
get<00:02:13.610> okay<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.330> top<00:02:15.599> two<00:02:15.840> both<00:02:16.230> come<00:02:16.440> with

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
get okay the top two both come with

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.820 
get okay the top two both come with
screen<00:02:16.800> protectors<00:02:17.250> well<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.870> second<00:02:19.349> life<00:02:19.530> or

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
screen protectors well in second life or

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.520 
screen protectors well in second life or
linear<00:02:20.069> with<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.310> otterbox<00:02:20.700> commuter<00:02:21.530> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
linear with the otterbox commuter it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.890 
linear with the otterbox commuter it
would<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.739> been<00:02:22.800> easy<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.280> throw<00:02:23.459> both<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
would have been easy to throw both the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.449 
would have been easy to throw both the
community<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> defender<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.400> I

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
community and the defender in but I

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.970 
community and the defender in but I
thought<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:27.209> for<00:02:27.390> diversity<00:02:27.900> I'll<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.830> pick

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
thought go for diversity I'll just pick

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.000 
thought go for diversity I'll just pick
one<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.310> them<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.580> bond<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> commuter

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
one of them and a bond for the commuter

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
one of them and a bond for the commuter
because<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.100> less<00:02:32.280> bulk<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.739> think

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
because it's less bulk and I just think

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.030 
because it's less bulk and I just think
is<00:02:36.750> better<00:02:37.080> value<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.590> money<00:02:37.650> than<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
is better value for money than the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
is better value for money than the
defender<00:02:38.489> really<00:02:38.790> i<00:02:38.940> don't<00:02:39.239> find<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.690> use<00:02:39.900> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
defender really i don't find a use of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.229
