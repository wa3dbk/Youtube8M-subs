00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.450
 Y 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.360
 hi hello wild beasts as they are I hope that 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.310
 very good I am d'angelo and in this 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.430
 I bring you a bolivar squad of 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.130
 the ms 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.800
 already preparing for the tournament that 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.770
 He comes tomorrow 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.379
 and then nothing start in the goal 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.719
 we have rhyming a pretty goalkeeper 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.550
 well I've been testing it and it has 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.350
 made many stops what can you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.860
 failing a little this player is the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.559
 clearance with your feet on the outside sometimes 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.699
 It seems that this letter is golden and very 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.030
 good reflexes and very good 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.030
 positioning 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.329
 of central defense we have a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.210
 you see read and he's a pretty fast player 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.899
 and balanced has a force of 74 and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 a defense of 75 really is very good 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.600
 in our position and look an 83 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 the next one is 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.910
 james a pretty fast player a 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 acceleration of 91 and a sprint in 94 a 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 super fast player with a strength of 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 80 can be removed at any 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.560
 player the only bad thing is that it's not very 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 high but it has a pretty 91 jump 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.790
 high to make a letter 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.790
 and on the other hand and it has worked for me 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.900
 pretty good this position if anything to 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.030
 Sometimes it seems that the body does not get too much 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.070
 and sometimes he wins in the body because 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.720
 there is an outside 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.720
 they are usually removed from most 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.110
 highly recommended players 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.070
 the next one is the right side is 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.490
 yedlín with a speed of 93 a physical 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.399
 of 70 a player with the defense of 61 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.430
 that sometimes feels much more is like 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.030
 a mini walker nothing but silver 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.030
 but like in this one 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.070
 the next lateral of the lateral 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.710
 left is franklin I'm using a 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.720
 right lateral really the chemistry in 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.110
 this position does not accept much how 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.530
 feel 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.380
 this player has a lot of force 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.660
 73 that's why I'm using the part 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.630
 he runs well apart in the field he feels 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.140
 much more with much more force 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.530
 the midfielders means of contention 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.980
 the first one is jones 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.160
 runs pretty well has a spin of 81 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.319
 an acceleration of 79 of a force of 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.870
 83 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.689
 that stands out to play is his strengths and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.239
 that to create the ball in the field it 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.090
 feels even more has a power of 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.889
 81 both will help them and the defense 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.889
 as the offensive 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.290
 the next one is osvaldo alonso this 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.180
 player is very fast to be of 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.130
 containment medium of a force of 80 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.950
 a stamina of 83 will last long 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.520
 the game is not going to tire a style 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.520
 82 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.240
 just as jones has a lot of power in 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.220
 Shot 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.990
 so when they are close to the goalie 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.920
 Do not hesitate to throw the battery is very 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.060
 strong and he will throw it well 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.790
 the following is kaka a pretty player 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.900
 balanced in the ms aspect or in 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.150
 the pass in the shot and in the rhythm 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.660
 I recommended several 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.660
 goals with him 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.710
 and the next left end is 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.850
 fabián castilla with an acceleration of 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.290
 88 a fairly fast player has good 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.840
 shot even though your door says that 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.470
 it's 66 sometimes without themes 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.200
 the only bad thing is strength 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.019
 but pretty good in this position what 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.480
 I tried and I made a few goals 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.120
 the next left end is 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.470
 yannick ice 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:32.370
 it has enough speed a spirit of 92 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.590
 has an acceptable shot sometimes turns 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.980
 he feels his shots more than what he says 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.170
 the letter 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.330
 but its strength if it really feels 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.370
 it has 49 strength and it was quoted very 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.069
 very weak and apart is a little short 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.009
 that's why it costs me a little bit 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.870
 a little bit of hard work 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.950
 you plant them pretty well 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:01.490
 the next forward since already many 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.819
 have to know is obafemi martins 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.699
 with espn de 93 is an acceleration of 4 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.840
 has a lot of quality balance is good 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.050
 to jump 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.569
 and a header 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.069
 it has a lot of power in the river the only thing 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.810
 bad is that he does not have as much strength 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:23.389
 could the fire feel much more 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.520
 and so the entire staff has been 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.490
 trying it works pretty well except 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.340
 some little details in the defense the 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.350
 equipment is quite strong even in the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.880
 normal seasons can give battles 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.070
 No problem 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.760
 and the same formation is the same 4 of 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.680
 Stress 4-2-3-1 I like to play with msd 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.070
 now that they will defend me and cut me 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.620
 lines 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.240
 and that means by left and right 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.640
 help me cut lines in that 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.100
 position I hope you serve the team 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.560
 I really provide it and tomorrow I am 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.140
 now so I 'm ready to play 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.570
 with our players who put me 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.730
 quite expensive but they filled me up 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.460
 more so I would recommend that 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.670
 Buy your players within two days 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.560
 or three days will go down and then nothing if 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.830
 they liked it well like they subscribe 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.180
 share and we'll be fine in another 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.180
 goodbye video
