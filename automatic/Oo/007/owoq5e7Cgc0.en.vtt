do is you're gonna place that at the

do is you're gonna place that at the
base<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> curl<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.780> again<00:01:58.259> should

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
base of the curl and that again should

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
base of the curl and that again should
make<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> stable<00:01:59.189> enough<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.000> again

another one I'm gonna play someone a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.300 
another one I'm gonna play someone a
little<00:02:09.840> bit<00:02:09.930> farther<00:02:10.290> back<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.980> to<00:02:11.100> give<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
little bit farther back just to give it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.380 
little bit farther back just to give it
added<00:02:11.730> security

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
added security

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.210 
added security
I<00:02:12.570> don't<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.080> want<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.320> do<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.010> want

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
I don't you want to do is you just want

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.150 
I don't you want to do is you just want
to<00:02:14.340> quickly<00:02:14.670> separate<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.630> hair<00:02:15.840> into<00:02:16.160> two

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
to quickly separate your hair into two

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.530 
to quickly separate your hair into two
halves<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:20.460> doesn't<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.180> neat<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
halves it doesn't have to be neat in the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.910 
halves it doesn't have to be neat in the
back<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.930> fact<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.500> looks<00:02:22.650> better<00:02:22.770> if

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
back in fact I think it looks better if

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.490 
back in fact I think it looks better if
you<00:02:23.190> don't<00:02:23.460> make<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.700> neat<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> back<00:02:24.500> then

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
you don't make it neat in the back then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.390 
you don't make it neat in the back then
I'm<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> tie<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:28.470> side<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
I'm just going to tie one side up so it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.100 
I'm just going to tie one side up so it
doesn't<00:02:29.460> get<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:29.850> my<00:02:29.970> way<00:02:30.000> if<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.020> have

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
doesn't get in my way if you have

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500 
doesn't get in my way if you have
problems<00:02:31.590> with<00:02:31.740> flyaways<00:02:32.340> either<00:02:32.760> using

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
problems with flyaways either using

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.290 
problems with flyaways either using
something<00:02:34.320> like<00:02:34.500> an<00:02:34.650> air<00:02:34.890> gun<00:02:35.040> oil<00:02:35.430> which<00:02:36.090> will

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
something like an air gun oil which will

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.140 
something like an air gun oil which will
help<00:02:36.420> give<00:02:36.780> shine<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.560> control<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.700> little<00:02:38.880> bit

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
help give shine and control a little bit

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.640 
help give shine and control a little bit
of<00:02:39.270> control<00:02:39.510> very<00:02:39.840> light<00:02:40.110> control<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
of control very light control to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.490 
of control very light control to
flyaways<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.880> heavier<00:02:42.230> flyaways<00:02:43.230> go

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
flyaways if you have heavier flyaways go

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.430 
flyaways if you have heavier flyaways go
ahead<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:43.980> use<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.700> wax<00:02:44.940> based<00:02:45.240> pomade<00:02:45.870> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
ahead and use like a wax based pomade to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.290 
ahead and use like a wax based pomade to
really<00:02:46.680> help<00:02:46.860> weigh<00:02:47.070> them<00:02:47.310> down<00:02:47.340> what<00:02:48.150> you're

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300

gonna do I'm gonna use the air gun oil
you<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.490> gonna<00:02:50.760> put<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.120> bit<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.420> your

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
hands as you work the braid so you're

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.090 
hands as you work the braid so you're
just<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.660> grab<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.170> section<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.680> hair<00:03:01.890> in

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
just going to grab a section of hair in

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.780 
just going to grab a section of hair in
the<00:03:02.280> front<00:03:02.460> like<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.100> divide<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the front like so and then divide it

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.180 
the front like so and then divide it
into<00:03:06.060> three<00:03:06.420> sections<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:07.950> you're

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
into three sections and then you're

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:18.050 
into three sections and then you're
going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.400> braid<00:03:08.640> under

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.320 

then<00:03:18.950> after<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.040> do<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.060> first

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
then after you do that with the first

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.140 
then after you do that with the first
three<00:03:21.660> then<00:03:22.260> unit<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.099> top<00:03:23.430> strand<00:03:23.880> you're

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
three then unit that top strand you're

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.449 
three then unit that top strand you're
always<00:03:24.360> going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.959> grab<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.739> little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.220> more

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
always going to grab a little bit more

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.240 
always going to grab a little bit more
hair<00:03:26.849> every<00:03:27.720> time<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:28.170> take<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.560> under<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
hair every time you take it under the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.520 
hair every time you take it under the
braid<00:03:29.489> that's<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> only<00:03:30.959> strand<00:03:31.319> you're

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
braid that's the only strand you're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.130 
braid that's the only strand you're
going<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.709> do<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.069> with

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.730 

again<00:03:39.860> top<00:03:40.610> strand<00:03:42.190> grab<00:03:43.190> some<00:03:43.490> hair<00:03:44.740> I'm

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
again top strand grab some hair I'm

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.820 
again top strand grab some hair I'm
going<00:03:45.950> under<00:03:49.360> braiding<00:03:50.360> under<00:03:50.930> actually

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
going under braiding under actually

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.190 
going under braiding under actually
makes<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.280> braid<00:03:52.520> stand<00:03:53.060> up<00:03:53.330> on<00:03:53.750> your<00:03:53.780> hair

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
makes the braid stand up on your hair

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.440 
makes the braid stand up on your hair
instead<00:03:54.740> of<00:03:54.800> being<00:03:55.040> flat<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.820> head<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.210> a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
instead of being flat to the head like a

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:06.920 
instead of being flat to the head like a
traditional<00:03:57.140> French<00:03:57.410> braid<00:03:57.860> would<00:03:58.100> be

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:15.520 

you

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.979 

and<00:04:16.190> then<00:04:16.340> once<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.700> grab<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.269> last<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.870> it

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
and then once you grab the last of it

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.199 
and then once you grab the last of it
you're<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.590> going<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.160> braid<00:04:19.579> like<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.850> three

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
you're just going to braid like a three
