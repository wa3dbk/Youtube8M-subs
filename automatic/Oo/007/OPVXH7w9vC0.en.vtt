00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
about the user interface because they

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.030 
about the user interface because they
even<00:02:13.550> kept<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.480> stop<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.680> move<00:02:15.830> on

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040

rear<00:02:19.670> camera<00:02:19.940> 20<00:02:20.480> megapixels<00:02:21.050> think<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.739> an

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
rear camera 20 megapixels think it's an

I<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.920> tap<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> tap<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.900> take

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
I can tap and it's just the tap to take

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.290 
I can tap and it's just the tap to take
a<00:02:27.140> picture<00:02:27.620> didn't<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:28.280> take<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.760> focus

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
a picture didn't really take one focus

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.630 
a picture didn't really take one focus
but<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.750> take<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.989> look<00:02:30.140> close<00:02:30.980> up<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.430> see

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
but we can take a look close up to see

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.880 
but we can take a look close up to see
exactly<00:02:32.150> what<00:02:32.840> kind<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.260> picture<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.680> took

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
exactly what kind of a picture it took

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.979 
exactly what kind of a picture it took
it<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.519> looks<00:02:34.820> pretty<00:02:35.060> reasonable<00:02:35.810> to

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
it and that looks pretty reasonable to

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.140 
it and that looks pretty reasonable to
me<00:02:36.019> obviously<00:02:36.950> we're<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.370> pretty<00:02:37.550> well

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
me obviously we're in a pretty well

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.479 
me obviously we're in a pretty well
little<00:02:38.570> spotlit<00:02:39.050> condition<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.340> it'll<00:02:40.459> be

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
little spotlit condition so it'll be

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.460 
little spotlit condition so it'll be
great<00:02:40.790> for<00:02:41.060> know<00:02:41.180> exactly<00:02:41.720> how<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.989> performs

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
great for know exactly how it performs
