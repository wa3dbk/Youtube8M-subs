design project from any last night x5
now<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> wouldn<00:00:26.369> t<00:00:26.400> go<00:00:26.760> check<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> environment

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
now I wouldn t go check the environment

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.259 
now I wouldn t go check the environment
and<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> reasons<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.279> doing<00:00:29.789> solar

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and one of the reasons for doing solar

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.780 
and one of the reasons for doing solar
radiation<00:00:30.960> studies<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.650> inside<00:00:32.040> eco

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
radiation studies with inside eco

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
radiation studies with inside eco
checked<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.390> Vasari<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.110> rivet<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.680> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
checked and not Vasari or rivet is that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
checked and not Vasari or rivet is that
we<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.130> able<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> control<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.420> results<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
we are able to control the results and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.650 
we are able to control the results and
the<00:00:37.350> scale<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.070> bit<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.550> effective<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.329> here

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the scale a bit more effective in here

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
the scale a bit more effective in here
which<00:00:39.930> allows<00:00:40.290> us<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.579> oven<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.030> bit

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
which allows us to use the oven a bit

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
which allows us to use the oven a bit
more<00:00:42.480> effectively<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.440> specialize<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.550> we

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
more effectively and specialize so if we

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
more effectively and specialize so if we
go<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.879> display<00:00:45.420> settings<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.440> look<00:00:46.590> at

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
go to display settings and we look at

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
go to display settings and we look at
object<00:00:47.160> attributes<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.719> where

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
object attributes this is really where

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.799 
object attributes this is really where
we<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.590> visualize<00:00:50.210> radiation<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.420> inside

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
we can visualize radiation with inside

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
we can visualize radiation with inside
eco<00:00:52.140> check<00:00:52.379> though<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.190> really

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
eco check though that this is really

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
eco check though that this is really
from<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> simulation<00:00:54.149> previous<00:00:54.930> simulation<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
from a simulation previous simulation so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
from a simulation previous simulation so
let's<00:00:56.129> turn<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> avid<00:00:57.149> data<00:00:57.480> values<00:00:57.989> let's

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
let's turn on the avid data values let's

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
let's turn on the avid data values let's
go<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> display<00:00:59.070> settings<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
go to display settings and see that the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
go to display settings and see that the
way<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.809> control<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.980> by

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
way that we control this is really by

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130 
way that we control this is really by
the<00:01:02.219> object<00:01:02.760> attributes<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.780> turn<00:01:03.960> on

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the object attributes we can turn on

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.980 
the object attributes we can turn on
text<00:01:04.500> values<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.339> show<00:01:05.549> vectors<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.780> show

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
text values you can show vectors to show

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
text values you can show vectors to show
where<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> most<00:01:07.950> extreme<00:01:08.460> condition

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
where we have the most extreme condition

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
where we have the most extreme condition
throughout<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.810> year<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> course

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
throughout the year and we can of course

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.429 
throughout the year and we can of course
work<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> scale<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.810> something

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
work with the scale which is something

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
work with the scale which is something
quite<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.770> neat<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.340> inside<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.939> could<00:01:15.090> turn

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
quite a neat with inside you could turn

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.469 
quite a neat with inside you could turn
so<00:01:15.479> let's<00:01:15.840> say<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.619> between<00:01:17.479> 350

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so let's say we want to have between 350

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.960 
so let's say we want to have between 350
and<00:01:18.509> 1000<00:01:19.500> watts<00:01:19.920> per<00:01:20.189> square<00:01:20.400> meter<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and 1000 watts per square meter and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
and 1000 watts per square meter and
visualize<00:01:21.659> them<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.170> intent<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
visualize them the intent of this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
visualize them the intent of this
project<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.060> an<00:01:24.210> office<00:01:24.600> building

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
project here which is an office building

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
project here which is an office building
and<00:01:25.290> stood<00:01:25.560> guard<00:01:25.770> made<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.280> henning<00:01:26.580> last

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and stood guard made by henning last

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.030 
and stood guard made by henning last
night<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:28.020> order<00:01:28.229> countries<00:01:28.860> we

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
night was that in order countries we

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.289 
night was that in order countries we
really<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:30.000> balance

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really want to have a good balance

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
really want to have a good balance
because<00:01:30.960> there's<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.619> connection

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because there's really a connection

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
because there's really a connection
between<00:01:32.520> key<00:01:33.150> coming<00:01:33.570> from<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> Sun<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
between key coming from the Sun and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
between key coming from the Sun and
light<00:01:35.100> coming<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.820> Sun<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.329> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
light coming from the Sun which is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
light coming from the Sun which is
obvious<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.290> radiation<00:01:37.829> studies<00:01:38.340> allows<00:01:38.909> us

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
obvious so radiation studies allows us

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
obvious so radiation studies allows us
not<00:01:39.390> only<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.840> look<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.409> how<00:01:40.560> much<00:01:40.740> heat<00:01:41.009> will

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
not only to look at how much heat will

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.730 
not only to look at how much heat will
have<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.759> incident<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.960> different<00:01:43.350> 4c

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have an incident with the different 4c

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490 
have an incident with the different 4c
and<00:01:44.070> moves<00:01:44.549> an<00:01:44.909> element<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.720> our<00:01:45.899> building<00:01:46.350> but

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and moves an element of our building but

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
and moves an element of our building but
also<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.950> determine<00:01:47.369> where<00:01:47.939> we'll<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.360> some

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
also to determine where we'll have some

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.929 
also to determine where we'll have some
of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> extreme<00:01:49.439> conditions<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.399> regarding

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
of the extreme conditions in regarding

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
of the extreme conditions in regarding
to<00:01:51.180> daylight<00:01:51.689> factors<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.649> light<00:01:52.950> levels

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to daylight factors and light levels

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
to daylight factors and light levels
with<00:01:53.640> inside<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.060> building<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.990> not

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
with inside the building so it's not

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.469 
with inside the building so it's not
only<00:01:55.680> looking<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> outside<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.149> really

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
only looking at the outside it's really

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
only looking at the outside it's really
also<00:01:57.630> understanding<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.590> interior<00:01:59.250> layout

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
also understanding the interior layout

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.209 
also understanding the interior layout
of<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> building<00:02:00.270> placing<00:02:01.079> heat<00:02:01.560> producing

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
of the building placing heat producing

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.060 
of the building placing heat producing
rooms<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.119> spaces<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.990> functions<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.799> the

rooms and spaces and functions in the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.700 
rooms and spaces and functions in the
north<00:02:05.310> side<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.360> using<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.350> south

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
north side and really using this south

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.960 
north side and really using this south
and<00:02:07.950> eastern<00:02:08.369> without<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.300> more

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and eastern without to have more

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.240 
and eastern without to have more
environments<00:02:10.930> where<00:02:11.290> we<00:02:11.320> can<00:02:11.590> use<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
environments where we can use the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
environments where we can use the
daylight<00:02:12.640> with<00:02:12.940> inside<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> building<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.020> of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
daylight with inside the building and of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.590 
daylight with inside the building and of
course<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.800> use<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.940> kind<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.390> land

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
course we can use this to kind of land

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.020 
course we can use this to kind of land
where<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.200> put<00:02:17.440> solar<00:02:17.800> panels<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.670> stuff<00:02:18.850> like

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
where to put solar panels and stuff like

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.450 
where to put solar panels and stuff like
but<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.600> project<00:02:19.900> here<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.680> main<00:02:20.950> design

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
but this project here the main design

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.670 
but this project here the main design
intent<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.270> project<00:02:22.870> was<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.140> really

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
intent with this project was to really

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.980 
intent with this project was to really
make<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.130> facade<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.820> bit<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.300> close<00:02:25.660> where

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
make the facade a bit more close where

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.110 
make the facade a bit more close where
we<00:02:26.110> have<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> lot<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.620> radiation<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.400> making<00:02:27.850> it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we have a lot of radiation and making it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.910 
we have a lot of radiation and making it
a<00:02:28.240> bit<00:02:28.420> more<00:02:28.690> open<00:02:29.140> where<00:02:29.380> we<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.650> less

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
a bit more open where we have less

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.220 
a bit more open where we have less
radiation<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.850> really<00:02:31.210> have<00:02:31.480> some<00:02:31.750> more<00:02:31.960> light

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
radiation to really have some more light

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800 
radiation to really have some more light
coming<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.100> thereby<00:02:33.730> reduce<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.540> amount

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
coming in and thereby reduce the amount

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.320 
coming in and thereby reduce the amount
of<00:02:34.990> energy<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.560> we'll<00:02:36.010> need<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.340> light<00:02:37.060> up

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
of energy that we'll need to light up

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.600 
of energy that we'll need to light up
our<00:02:37.570> building<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.530> electric<00:02:39.010> lighting<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
our building with electric lighting and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.940 
our building with electric lighting and
in<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.910> same<00:02:40.150> time<00:02:40.480> reduce<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.530> amount<00:02:41.800> of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
in the same time reduce the amount of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.370 
in the same time reduce the amount of
discomfort<00:02:42.459> because<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.510> heat<00:02:43.900> coming<00:02:44.350> from

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
discomfort because of heat coming from

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.830 
discomfort because of heat coming from
the<00:02:44.590> Sun<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.250> penetrating<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.180> room<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the Sun and penetrating the room on the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.350 
the Sun and penetrating the room on the
satellite<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.740> really<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.520> was<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.790> intent

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
satellite so really that was the intent

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.199 
satellite so really that was the intent
and<00:02:49.660> if<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:50.050> turn<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.040> windows<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.760> the

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
and if we turn on the windows and the

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.330 
and if we turn on the windows and the
fillet<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.840> will<00:02:52.959> see<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.680> really

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
fillet you will see that this is really

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.280 
fillet you will see that this is really
what<00:02:54.550> we<00:02:54.700> try<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.510> course<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:56.140> relation

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
what we try to do of course in relation

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.190 
what we try to do of course in relation
to<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.250> overall<00:02:57.670> intent<00:02:58.300> with<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.720> project

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
to the overall intent with the project

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.170 
to the overall intent with the project
so<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> facade<00:02:59.860> here<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.250> really<00:03:00.459> consisting

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
so the facade here is really consisting

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.720 
so the facade here is really consisting
are<00:03:01.360> lacing<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.110> closed<00:03:02.680> panels<00:03:03.280> where<00:03:03.610> we

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
are lacing and closed panels where we

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.060 
are lacing and closed panels where we
place<00:03:04.060> solar<00:03:04.480> panel<00:03:04.990> at<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.230> places<00:03:05.830> where

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
place solar panel at the places where

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.460 
place solar panel at the places where
we'll<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.490> a<00:03:06.760> lot<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> radiation<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:08.020> just

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
we'll have a lot of radiation and just

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.980 
we'll have a lot of radiation and just
close<00:03:08.709> pounds<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.490> other<00:03:09.880> places<00:03:10.330> of<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
close pounds on other places of the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.410 
close pounds on other places of the
building<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.530> you'll<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.160> as<00:03:12.430> well<00:03:12.940> here<00:03:13.300> on

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
building so you'll see as well here on

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.690 
building so you'll see as well here on
the<00:03:13.600> north<00:03:13.989> side<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.320> replacing<00:03:15.100> big<00:03:15.280> windows

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
the north side of replacing big windows

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.640 
the north side of replacing big windows
here<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.390> really<00:03:16.510> simple<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.320> pretty

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
here so just really simple and pretty

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.160 
here so just really simple and pretty
logical<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.700> understand<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.390> I'm<00:03:19.959> just

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
logical do you understand so I'm just

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.810 
logical do you understand so I'm just
going<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.410> take<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.769> simple<00:03:21.250> model<00:03:21.430> to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
going to take this simple model to

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.550 
going to take this simple model to
really<00:03:22.150> get<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.690> started<00:03:23.050> with<00:03:23.170> how<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:23.500> is

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
really get you started with how this is

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.800 
really get you started with how this is
working<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.700> made<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.940> really<00:03:25.390> simple

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
working so just made a really simple

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.020 
working so just made a really simple
model<00:03:26.019> here<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.280> some<00:03:27.610> context

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
model here and with like some context

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.120 
model here and with like some context
buildings<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.720> what<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.870> did<00:03:29.140> was<00:03:29.470> really<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
buildings and what I did was really to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.640 
buildings and what I did was really to
go<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.760> subdivide<00:03:31.420> these<00:03:31.660> surfaces<00:03:32.290> to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
go in and subdivide these surfaces to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.800 
go in and subdivide these surfaces to
have<00:03:33.160> some<00:03:33.370> more<00:03:33.519> measuring<00:03:34.000> points<00:03:34.390> each<00:03:34.570> of

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
have some more measuring points each of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.320 
have some more measuring points each of
these<00:03:35.019> surfaces<00:03:35.680> here<00:03:36.160> are<00:03:36.400> measuring<00:03:36.970> points

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
these surfaces here are measuring points

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.509 
these surfaces here are measuring points
and<00:03:37.510> then<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.810> go<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:37.989> calculate<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:38.950> solar

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
and then I go to calculate and so solar

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.729 
and then I go to calculate and so solar
access<00:03:39.820> analysis<00:03:40.630> which<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.380> way<00:03:41.500> that

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
access analysis which is the way that

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.259 
access analysis which is the way that
you<00:03:41.860> look<00:03:42.070> at<00:03:42.220> sort<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.549> radiation<00:03:43.120> with

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
you look at sort of radiation with

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.390 
you look at sort of radiation with
inside<00:03:43.660> Ecotec<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.500> I'm<00:03:44.739> using<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
inside Ecotec and I'm using the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.970 
inside Ecotec and I'm using the
incidence<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.000> radiation<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.769> sunlight

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
incidence of radiation and the sunlight

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.490 
incidence of radiation and the sunlight
is<00:03:48.459> down<00:03:48.670> here<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.299> domain<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:50.200> I'm<00:03:50.320> using

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
is down here that domain that I'm using

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.979 
is down here that domain that I'm using
but<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.070> course<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.519> can<00:03:51.730> do

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
but of course you can do

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.330 
but of course you can do
before-and-after<00:03:52.989> comparisons<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.040> stuff

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
before-and-after comparisons and stuff

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.009 
before-and-after comparisons and stuff
like<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.700> but<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:55.239> looking<00:03:55.690> at<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
like that but for looking at the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.289 
like that but for looking at the
interiors<00:03:56.470> exterior<00:03:57.160> spaces<00:03:57.489> here<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.120> might

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
interiors exterior spaces here it might

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.660 
interiors exterior spaces here it might
be<00:03:58.540> incident<00:03:59.200> solar<00:03:59.500> radiation<00:03:59.620> you<00:04:00.370> want<00:04:00.610> to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
be incident solar radiation you want to

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.430 
be incident solar radiation you want to
look<00:04:00.790> for<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.269> let's<00:04:01.480> turn<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.810> off<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.200> you

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
look for so let's turn that off and you

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.560 
look for so let's turn that off and you
can<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.709> course<00:04:02.739> apply<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.730> do<00:04:03.940> simulations

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
can of course apply and do simulations

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.300 
can of course apply and do simulations
for<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.900> cure<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.290> date<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.739> time<00:04:05.980> which

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
for a cure and date and time which

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.240 
for a cure and date and time which
allows<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.910> really<00:04:07.600> just<00:04:08.260> scroll<00:04:08.890> here

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
allows you to really just scroll here

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.370 
allows you to really just scroll here
for<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.730> specific<00:04:10.390> date<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:10.900> what's<00:04:11.140> that

this for a specific period and I'm just
going<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.239> look<00:04:16.419> at<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.840> whole<00:04:17.019> year<00:04:17.350> at<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
going to look at the whole year at the

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.130 
going to look at the whole year at the
timespan<00:04:18.520> where<00:04:19.030> we're<00:04:19.209> using<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.780> building

and<00:04:20.320> I'm<00:04:20.739> going<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.039> look<00:04:21.220> at<00:04:21.400> every<00:04:21.700> daily

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
and I'm going to look at every daily

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.879 
and I'm going to look at every daily
values<00:04:22.479> which<00:04:22.840> give<00:04:23.140> us<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.470> sense

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
values which give us a sense

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.850 
values which give us a sense
we're<00:04:24.310> placing<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.240> what<00:04:25.629> kind<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.870> radios<00:04:26.379> we

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
we're placing and what kind of radios we

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.040 
we're placing and what kind of radios we
want<00:04:27.099> for<00:04:27.310> our<00:04:27.430> glazing<00:04:27.939> so<00:04:28.180> I'm<00:04:28.509> just<00:04:28.780> gonna

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
want for our glazing so I'm just gonna

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.409 
want for our glazing so I'm just gonna
say<00:04:29.409> cancel<00:04:30.099> and<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.400> want<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.699> select<00:04:31.060> because

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
say cancel and I want to select because

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.420 
say cancel and I want to select because
I<00:04:31.689> want<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.930> do<00:04:32.139> for<00:04:32.529> all<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.860> these<00:04:33.009> objects

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
I want to do for all of these objects

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.459 
I want to do for all of these objects
here<00:04:33.669> just<00:04:34.150> select<00:04:34.479> objects<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.050> go<00:04:35.289> back

and<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.849> first<00:04:43.060> time<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.389> do<00:04:43.539> this<00:04:43.569> you<00:04:43.749> have

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
and the first time you do this you have

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.390 
and the first time you do this you have
to<00:04:44.229> perform<00:04:44.409> a<00:04:44.680> detailed<00:04:44.860> shading

to perform a detailed shading

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.129 
to perform a detailed shading
calculation<00:04:45.999> now<00:04:46.150> that's<00:04:46.389> why<00:04:46.659> you<00:04:46.960> could

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
calculation now that's why you could

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.839 
calculation now that's why you could
take<00:04:47.319> this<00:04:47.499> and<00:04:47.710> that<00:04:47.860> effective<00:04:48.370> because<00:04:48.699> it

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
take this and that effective because it

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.489 
take this and that effective because it
takes<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.210> lot<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.389> time<00:04:49.689> but<00:04:49.990> if<00:04:50.080> we're<00:04:50.289> using

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:50.499 
takes a lot of time but if we're using

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.950 
takes a lot of time but if we're using
this<00:04:50.800> shading<00:04:51.490> mask<00:04:51.669> here<00:04:51.909> it's<00:04:52.210> very<00:04:52.479> fast<00:04:52.810> to

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.899 
this shading mask here it's very fast to
do<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.259> simulation<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.039> we<00:04:54.279> can<00:04:54.430> down<00:04:54.580> go

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
do the simulation and we can down go

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.869 
do the simulation and we can down go
down<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.569> to<00:04:55.990> our<00:04:56.289> scale<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:57.250> say<00:04:57.460> okay<00:04:57.729> we

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
down to to our scale and say okay we

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.290 
down to to our scale and say okay we
want<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.120> see<00:04:58.270> where<00:04:58.599> there's<00:04:58.900> zero<00:04:59.110> to<00:05:00.300> 750

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.570 
want to see where there's zero to 750
maybe<00:05:01.539> like<00:05:01.810> that<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.319> you<00:05:02.650> go<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:02.919> visualize

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
maybe like that and you go to visualize

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.119 
maybe like that and you go to visualize
tab<00:05:03.939> and<00:05:04.180> we<00:05:04.389> now<00:05:04.539> visualize<00:05:05.199> this<00:05:05.469> on<00:05:05.710> our

so<00:05:25.659> this<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:26.050> really<00:05:26.259> just<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.889> basic<00:05:27.279> and<00:05:27.520> a

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
so this is really just a basic and a

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.010 
so this is really just a basic and a
great<00:05:28.000> thing<00:05:28.210> is<00:05:28.419> that<00:05:28.449> you<00:05:28.689> can<00:05:28.870> go<00:05:28.990> to

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
great thing is that you can go to

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.439 
great thing is that you can go to
properties<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.039> you<00:05:30.189> can<00:05:30.339> just<00:05:30.550> see<00:05:30.789> analyze

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
properties and you can just see analyze

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.570 
properties and you can just see analyze
data<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.439> will<00:05:32.469> make<00:05:32.889> this<00:05:33.099> very<00:05:33.339> cool

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
data and it will make this very cool

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.339 
data and it will make this very cool
graph<00:05:33.879> that<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:34.300> don't<00:05:34.479> have<00:05:34.659> to<00:05:34.839> set<00:05:35.050> up<00:05:35.080> you

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
graph that you don't have to set up you

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.170 
graph that you don't have to set up you
can<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:35.710> use<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:35.889> directly<00:05:36.219> it<00:05:36.729> calculate

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
can just use it directly it calculate

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.629 
can just use it directly it calculate
the<00:05:37.449> maximum<00:05:37.719> and<00:05:38.289> minimum<00:05:38.319> values<00:05:38.740> and<00:05:39.490> you

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
the maximum and minimum values and you

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.490 
the maximum and minimum values and you
can<00:05:39.789> take<00:05:39.969> this<00:05:40.149> out<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.539> excel<00:05:40.839> for<00:05:40.899> doing

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
can take this out to excel for doing

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.800 
can take this out to excel for doing
comparisons<00:05:42.279> numeric<00:05:42.939> comparisons<00:05:43.659> of
