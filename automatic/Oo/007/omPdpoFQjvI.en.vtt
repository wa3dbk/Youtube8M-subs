00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and today we'll be testing out two new

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
and today we'll be testing out two new
pieces<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.639> gear<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.300> received<00:00:12.780> lately

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
pieces of gear that I received lately

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.320 
pieces of gear that I received lately
off<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.380> pro<00:00:13.590> deal<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:13.889> work<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:15.059> will<00:00:15.179> be

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
off my pro deal at work and that will be

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.570 
off my pro deal at work and that will be
the<00:00:15.800> MSR<00:00:16.800> solo<00:00:17.460> pop<00:00:17.760> hit<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.680> also<00:00:20.660> the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
the MSR solo pop hit here and also the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.990 
the MSR solo pop hit here and also the
MSR<00:00:23.609> pocket<00:00:24.359> rocket<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.680> yeah<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.519> we'll<00:00:26.880> be

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
MSR pocket rocket so yeah and we'll be

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.800 
MSR pocket rocket so yeah and we'll be
doing<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.630> boil<00:00:28.349> test<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.300> fast<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
doing a boil test to see how fast to a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.870 
doing a boil test to see how fast to a
boil<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> don't<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> speed<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> guys

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
boil and don't to speed when you guys

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840 
boil and don't to speed when you guys
know<00:00:33.440> what<00:00:34.440> I've<00:00:34.590> seen<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.250> gear<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.640> far

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
know what I've seen with my gear so far

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.830 
know what I've seen with my gear so far
so<00:00:36.890> here<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.820> half<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> liter<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.410> water

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
so here I have a half a liter of water

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.799 
so here I have a half a liter of water
and<00:00:42.840> we'll<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.829> checking<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:45.390> long<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and we'll be checking to see how long it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.790 
and we'll be checking to see how long it
takes<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> boil<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.690> pocket<00:00:49.680> rocket

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
takes it to boil so the pocket rocket

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.750 
takes it to boil so the pocket rocket
comes<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.820> pretty<00:00:51.449> nice<00:00:51.719> little<00:00:52.760> red

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
comes in this pretty nice little red

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
comes in this pretty nice little red
case<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:57.000> pretty<00:00:57.239> nice<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> bends<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
case it's pretty nice I know it bends a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
case it's pretty nice I know it bends a
little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.989> possibility<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
little bit so it's possibility that you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.450 
little bit so it's possibility that you
could<00:01:01.410> break<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:03.830> just<00:01:04.830> keep<00:01:04.979> inside<00:01:05.339> my

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
could break it but I just keep inside my

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.990 
could break it but I just keep inside my
pocket<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> stove<00:01:07.740> itself<00:01:08.070> weighs<00:01:08.430> three

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
pocket the stove itself weighs three

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
pocket the stove itself weighs three
ounces<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.590> runs<00:01:10.830> off<00:01:11.540> pretty<00:01:12.540> sure<00:01:12.780> it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
ounces and it runs off pretty sure it's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
ounces and it runs off pretty sure it's
of<00:01:13.820> propane<00:01:15.020> isobutane<00:01:16.020> mix<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
of propane isobutane mix so it is a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.620 
of propane isobutane mix so it is a
liquid<00:01:18.840> fuel<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.549> usually<00:01:20.549> I'd<00:01:21.060> recommend

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
liquid fuel and usually I'd recommend

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
liquid fuel and usually I'd recommend
the<00:01:21.750> MSR<00:01:22.200> brand<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.240> my<00:01:24.710> outdoor<00:01:25.710> shop

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the MSR brand one but my outdoor shop

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
the MSR brand one but my outdoor shop
recently<00:01:26.520> started<00:01:26.820> getting<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.270> Burton<00:01:28.170> max

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
recently started getting this Burton max

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.390 
recently started getting this Burton max
or<00:01:28.770> max<00:01:29.220> Burton<00:01:29.670> feel<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.290> six<00:01:31.619> above

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
or max Burton feel that it's six above

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.899 
or max Burton feel that it's six above
three<00:01:33.150> four<00:01:33.420> bucks<00:01:33.659> cheaper<00:01:33.930> than<00:01:34.579> MSR<00:01:35.579> fuel

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
three four bucks cheaper than MSR fuel

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.910 
three four bucks cheaper than MSR fuel
brand<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.869> apparently<00:01:37.500> by<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> same

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
brand and it's apparently by the same

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.460 
brand and it's apparently by the same
company<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> let's<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.470> screw<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> here

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
company so let's just screw it on here

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
company so let's just screw it on here
for<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.649> type<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.950> stove<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
for this type of stove you do have to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.789 
for this type of stove you do have to
get<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.079> threaded<00:01:47.090> screw<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.439> canisters<00:01:49.439> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
get the threaded screw on canisters I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.300 
get the threaded screw on canisters I
guess<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.460> Europe<00:01:50.850> they<00:01:51.090> use<00:01:51.799> just<00:01:52.799> pop<00:01:53.070> on

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
guess in Europe they use just pop on

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
guess in Europe they use just pop on
ones<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.420> stuff<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
ones but for this stuff you do have to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.319 
ones but for this stuff you do have to
use<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.439> threaded<00:01:56.189> canister<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> there's<00:01:58.049> no

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
use the threaded canister and there's no

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.730 
use the threaded canister and there's no
ignition<00:02:00.329> system<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.530> will

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
ignition system to it so you will

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
ignition system to it so you will
actually<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> lighter<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.299> light

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
actually need to have a lighter to light

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.210 
actually need to have a lighter to light
the<00:02:04.380> stove<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:05.100> matches<00:02:05.640> or

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
the stove or matches or

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.749 
the stove or matches or
whatever<00:02:06.460> your<00:02:06.760> preferences<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.780> uh<00:02:08.759> yeah

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
whatever your preferences so uh yeah

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.309 
whatever your preferences so uh yeah
let's<00:02:10.270> get<00:02:10.750> up<00:02:10.899> down<00:02:11.650> here

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.280 

as<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.249> see<00:02:18.749> probably<00:02:19.749> got<00:02:19.989> its<00:02:20.140> name

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
as you can see probably got its name

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.160 
as you can see probably got its name
pocket<00:02:20.739> rockets<00:02:21.159> from<00:02:21.370> how<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.030> actually<00:02:22.689> kind

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
pocket rockets from how it actually kind

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.550 
pocket rockets from how it actually kind
of<00:02:23.230> looks<00:02:23.560> like<00:02:23.829> a<00:02:24.249> rocket<00:02:24.670> engine<00:02:25.349> maybe<00:02:26.349> I'm

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
of looks like a rocket engine maybe I'm

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.830 
of looks like a rocket engine maybe I'm
just<00:02:26.859> imagining<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.609> but<00:02:27.909> uh<00:02:27.939> let<00:02:28.569> me<00:02:28.599> bring

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
just imagining that but uh let me bring

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.309 
just imagining that but uh let me bring
the<00:02:28.959> camera<00:02:29.319> in<00:02:29.349> for<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> closer<00:02:29.980> look<00:02:30.219> at<00:02:30.609> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
the camera in for a closer look at the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.930 
the camera in for a closer look at the
flame

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.479 

so<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.200> about<00:02:42.470> medium<00:02:43.690> victory

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
so there it is on about medium victory

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.430 
so there it is on about medium victory
in<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:45.969> draft<00:02:46.269> here

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
in the draft here

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.690 
in the draft here
great<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.550> up<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.790> bit

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.199 

be<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.540> uh<00:02:54.129> it<00:02:55.129> gets<00:02:55.280> quite<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.970> hotter

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
be that it uh it gets quite a bit hotter

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.920 
be that it uh it gets quite a bit hotter
and<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.870> now<00:02:59.989> it's<00:03:00.230> glowing<00:03:01.180> orange<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.629> how

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
and so now it's glowing orange so how

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.800 
and so now it's glowing orange so how
about<00:03:03.019> we<00:03:03.310> toss<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.610> pollen<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.269> start<00:03:05.690> our

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
about we toss the pollen and start our

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:19.030 
about we toss the pollen and start our
timer

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.199 

so<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.330> solo<00:03:22.080> pot<00:03:22.709> here<00:03:23.250> maybe<00:03:24.150> I

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
so this is the solo pot here maybe I

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.140 
so this is the solo pot here maybe I
should<00:03:24.680> back<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.890> camera<00:03:26.340> up<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.640> little<00:03:26.880> bit

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
should back the camera up a little bit

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.559 
should back the camera up a little bit
for<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> here<00:03:30.770> but<00:03:31.770> this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.190> sole<00:03:32.910> pocket

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
for you here but this is the sole pocket

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.980 
for you here but this is the sole pocket
from<00:03:33.750> Atmos<00:03:34.080> are<00:03:34.940> not<00:03:35.940> quite<00:03:36.300> sure<00:03:36.330> how<00:03:36.840> much

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
from Atmos are not quite sure how much

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.130 
from Atmos are not quite sure how much
it<00:03:37.200> retails<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.770> I'm<00:03:38.190> guessing<00:03:38.570> most<00:03:39.570> likely

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
it retails for I'm guessing most likely

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.890 
it retails for I'm guessing most likely
in<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:41.870> 30<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.020> 40<00:03:43.890> dollar<00:03:44.100> range<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.900> it's

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
in the 30 to 40 dollar range and it's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.690 
in the 30 to 40 dollar range and it's
made<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.560> hard<00:03:46.920> anodized<00:03:47.640> aluminum<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:49.700> so

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
made of hard anodized aluminum and so

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550 
made of hard anodized aluminum and so
far<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.030> love<00:03:51.450> it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
far I love it

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.960 
far I love it
the<00:03:53.040> hard<00:03:53.250> agonised<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:55.130> extremely<00:03:56.130> easy<00:03:56.670> to

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the hard agonised is extremely easy to

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.960 
the hard agonised is extremely easy to
get<00:03:57.390> food<00:03:57.690> off<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.769> doesn't<00:03:59.160> burn<00:03:59.430> quite

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
get food off of it doesn't burn quite

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.170 
get food off of it doesn't burn quite
like<00:04:00.180> aluminum<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.080> also<00:04:01.910> somehow<00:04:02.910> in

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
like aluminum and it's also somehow in

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.840 
like aluminum and it's also somehow in
the<00:04:03.239> process<00:04:03.750> when<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.110> turn<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> into

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
the process when they turn it into

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.100 
the process when they turn it into
anodized<00:04:05.850> aluminum<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.989> it'll<00:04:07.620> prevent<00:04:07.980> the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
anodized aluminum it it'll prevent the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.390 
anodized aluminum it it'll prevent the
aluminum<00:04:10.110> particles<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.070> your<00:04:11.190> food

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
aluminum particles get in your food

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.479 
aluminum particles get in your food
which<00:04:11.670> we<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.450> know<00:04:12.920> has<00:04:13.920> been<00:04:14.160> linked<00:04:14.400> to

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
which we all know has been linked to

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.550 
which we all know has been linked to
cause<00:04:14.910> Alzheimer's<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.810> that's<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.169> benefit

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
cause Alzheimer's so that's a benefit

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.080 
cause Alzheimer's so that's a benefit
abuse<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.010> aluminum<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.609> lightweight<00:04:17.880> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
abuse of aluminum it's lightweight and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.289 
abuse of aluminum it's lightweight and
with<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.630> hard<00:04:18.810> anodized<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.820> has<00:04:20.820> less<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
with the hard anodized it has less of a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.280 
with the hard anodized it has less of a
chance<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.750> give<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.049> Alzheimer's<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.370> with

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
chance to give you Alzheimer's but with

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.100 
chance to give you Alzheimer's but with
this<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.770> also<00:04:25.979> can't<00:04:26.580> use<00:04:26.669> metal<00:04:27.479> utensils

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
this you also can't use metal utensils

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.530 
this you also can't use metal utensils
because<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.500> will<00:04:28.620> scrape<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.130> off<00:04:29.360> faster<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
because it will scrape it off faster and

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.409 
because it will scrape it off faster and
easier<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:31.290> have<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.890> use<00:04:32.010> like<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.180> light

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
easier so you have to use like the light

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.190 
easier so you have to use like the light
my<00:04:33.600> fire<00:04:34.700> utensils<00:04:35.700> are<00:04:35.940> something<00:04:36.840> such<00:04:37.169> as

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
that and yeah the pots it's pretty

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.320

the handle is extremely sturdy and yeah
so<00:05:18.730> far<00:05:18.970> it's<00:05:19.240> worked<00:05:19.750> really<00:05:19.960> well<00:05:20.080> for<00:05:20.230> me

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
so far it's worked really well for me

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.160 
so far it's worked really well for me
the<00:05:22.420> stove<00:05:22.860> costs<00:05:23.860> about<00:05:24.190> $40<00:05:25.180> retail<00:05:25.660> but<00:05:26.020> if

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
the stove costs about $40 retail but if

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
extremely fast so far as I've tested I

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.670 
extremely fast so far as I've tested I
tried<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.100> against<00:05:42.490> my<00:05:42.700> other<00:05:43.380> coleman<00:05:44.380> power

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
tried it against my other coleman power

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.810 
tried it against my other coleman power
max<00:05:44.980> fuel<00:05:45.630> stove<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.500> beat<00:05:47.710> that<00:05:47.950> by<00:05:48.250> quite

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
max fuel stove and it beat that by quite

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.770 
max fuel stove and it beat that by quite
a<00:05:48.850> bit<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:51.240> then<00:05:52.240> i<00:05:52.390> tried<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.780> against<00:05:53.290> my

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
a bit and then i tried it against my

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.840 
a bit and then i tried it against my
Trangia<00:05:55.780> swedish<00:05:56.380> military<00:05:56.590> alcohol<00:05:57.460> stove

Trangia swedish military alcohol stove

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.210 
Trangia swedish military alcohol stove
and<00:05:58.240> defeat<00:05:58.930> that<00:05:58.960> by<00:05:59.350> about<00:05:59.530> five<00:05:59.860> minutes

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
and defeat that by about five minutes

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.530 
and defeat that by about five minutes
and<00:06:01.350> yeah<00:06:02.350> so<00:06:02.710> of<00:06:03.280> all<00:06:03.490> the<00:06:03.610> snows<00:06:03.850> I've<00:06:04.090> tested

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
and yeah so of all the snows I've tested

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.980 
and yeah so of all the snows I've tested
it's<00:06:04.690> been<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.080> most<00:06:05.110> efficient<00:06:05.920> and<00:06:06.990> we're

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
it's been the most efficient and we're

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.540 
it's been the most efficient and we're
already<00:06:08.170> starting<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.680> boil<00:06:08.950> a<00:06:09.100> little<00:06:09.190> bit

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
already starting to boil a little bit

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.890 
already starting to boil a little bit
here<00:06:09.880> so<00:06:10.110> over<00:06:11.110> up<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:12.120> just<00:06:13.120> about<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.570> three

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
here so over up the just about the three

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.020 
here so over up the just about the three
minute<00:06:14.230> mark<00:06:14.410> so<00:06:14.770> let<00:06:15.070> me<00:06:15.190> bring<00:06:15.430> it<00:06:15.580> in<00:06:15.730> here

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
minute mark so let me bring it in here

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.300 
minute mark so let me bring it in here
real<00:06:16.180> quick

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.820 

and<00:06:19.730> as<00:06:19.940> you<00:06:20.120> can<00:06:20.270> see<00:06:20.350> it's<00:06:21.350> getting<00:06:21.530> the

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
and as you can see it's getting the

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.379 
and as you can see it's getting the
little<00:06:22.100> bubbles<00:06:22.460> on<00:06:22.610> the<00:06:22.730> bottom<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:23.270> then

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
little bubbles on the bottom and then

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.420 
little bubbles on the bottom and then
some<00:06:23.840> of<00:06:23.930> the<00:06:23.990> big<00:06:24.139> bubbles<00:06:24.560> to<00:06:24.770> rise<00:06:24.800> up<00:06:24.950> so

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
some of the big bubbles to rise up so

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.470 
some of the big bubbles to rise up so
not<00:06:25.550> quite<00:06:26.030> a<00:06:26.150> full<00:06:26.450> bubble<00:06:26.870> but<00:06:28.120> first<00:06:29.120> of

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
not quite a full bubble but first of

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.590 
not quite a full bubble but first of
test<00:06:29.870> it's<00:06:30.139> about<00:06:30.490> it's<00:06:31.490> about<00:06:31.700> the<00:06:32.060> standard

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
test it's about it's about the standard

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.120 
test it's about it's about the standard
standard<00:06:33.290> bubble

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
standard bubble

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.460 
standard bubble
I<00:06:34.210> guess<00:06:35.210> if<00:06:35.389> there<00:06:35.540> is<00:06:35.630> a<00:06:35.660> standard<00:06:35.930> bubble

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
I guess if there is a standard bubble

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.770 
I guess if there is a standard bubble
yes<00:06:37.430> so<00:06:38.830> that<00:06:39.830> would<00:06:40.010> be<00:06:40.190> and<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.300> turn<00:06:41.510> it<00:06:41.540> off

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
yes so that would be and to turn it off

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.540 
yes so that would be and to turn it off
it<00:06:42.080> just<00:06:42.110> has<00:06:42.440> this<00:06:42.650> flame<00:06:42.950> adjuster<00:06:43.430> right

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
it just has this flame adjuster right

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.860 
it just has this flame adjuster right
here<00:06:43.760> and<00:06:43.910> you<00:06:43.970> just<00:06:44.120> turn<00:06:44.360> it<00:06:44.480> all<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.750> way

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
here and you just turn it all the way

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.900 
here and you just turn it all the way
and<00:06:45.580> it<00:06:46.580> shuts<00:06:46.850> itself<00:06:47.030> off<00:06:48.430> yeah<00:06:49.430> extremely

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
and it shuts itself off yeah extremely

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.620 
and it shuts itself off yeah extremely
easy<00:06:50.480> to<00:06:50.690> use<00:06:51.220> snow<00:06:52.220> cleaning<00:06:52.970> necessary
