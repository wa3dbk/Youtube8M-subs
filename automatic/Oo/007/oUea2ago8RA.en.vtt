00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.760
 today we are going to see two applications of 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.970
 construction related to 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.639
 structures one of them is called fox 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 effect and it's from autodesk and the other sky 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.700
 parametric chairs 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.610
 We start with zeroes them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.710
 parametric 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.780
 there are two versions, a basic one that is 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.780
 this one that we are going to try today and another with 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.720
 more options 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.790
 in the menus below we have 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.830
 several options the first one is 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.739
 the type of lattice 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.400
 some types are predefined 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.820
 we can use 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.980
 the second option is the number of stretches 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.630
 varying here or here we modify 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.840
 the number of stretches our 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.330
 zero society the third option is the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.240
 total length of it we see how 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.070
 varies I want a length of meters 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.070
 the fourth option is the middle song 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.629
 here we have the kind of left support 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.860
 Fixed support sliding or without support 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.680
 we leave the same fixed for the right 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.690
 while the superior uniform charge 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.380
 we have here the lower uniform charge 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.380
 punctual 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.570
 the section of the bars of group 1 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.160
 and section bars groups is 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.930
 say we can define groups of 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.040
 bars with which to easily modify 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 the section 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.680
 one of the bars and modify here is a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.680
 section 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.179
 in the menu up here show us 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.790
 the deformed we get when applying 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.620
 the efforts 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.020
 all these options that we have here 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.800
 above are to modify how 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.410
 let's visualize the data 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.350
 with these first we see how we assign 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.960
 the thickness or the color to the effort to the area 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.470
 etc 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.970
 we want more or less elements and what 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.970
 same with this last option 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.730
 in another program 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.130
 then by default 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.950
 this is only for calculation of 0 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.990
 follow but it's more generic has 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.240
 an option that does not have the other that is 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.830
 to be able to include a photograph about 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.600
 which can draw our structure 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.010
 as you can see here on the bicycle 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.010
 is here 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.060
 we are going to create a structure of 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.060
 starting from zero 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.600
 to begin with , it gives us to choose if we want 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.850
 take a picture to do what 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.650
 you have seen before or choose a 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.190
 photography of which we connect 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 with another is 360 or just a paper 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.990
 we can see here in tul tips the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.780
 different menus that mean here 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.170
 we have for the selection menu a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.470
 submenu with the elements to add 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.080
 will be the bars another with others a menu 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.540
 with the other loads of supports and the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.950
 last to erase up here we see the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.100
 icon that shows us the degrees of 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.980
 freedom of our structure 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.660
 we are going to create a small structure that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.440
 will consist of a bar here below 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.790
 2 meters long 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.270
 example let's make another one here 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.530
 above 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:26.260
 and others that we already have this that we do 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.870
 let's put some support here and here 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.040
 then let's assign the charges we're going 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.040
 to put a load up here 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.310
 a value of 31 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.590
 thankful they are seeing a millimeter 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.430
 this can be changed here in the menu 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.610
 settings 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.460
 the length in millimeters centimeters or 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.540
 meters and the same for 500 forces 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.540
 kilos and ptolomeo newton 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.100
 very well then here we get our 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.610
 resulting from having applied it to this 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.770
 strength that up 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.440
 and we are going to modify 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.410
 a force let's apply it down 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.330
 You see how everything is modified 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.370
 what else can we do then here in 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.860
 forces put a load 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.860
 and we assign here a distributed burden 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.530
 for example 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.960
 well because we already have our 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.810
 calculated structure now talking to 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.720
 this icon up here shows us a 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.729
 report with the input data 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.520
 Y 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.430
 the distributed forces these are the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.559
 input data the results and here 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.380
 we see equations and all the results 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:44.849
 of the different supports and the two 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.580
 the same we see here below 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.240
 the stress diagrams 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.009
 event times are the three elements as 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 placing some three bars 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.240
 different results of each of 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.000
 they 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.810
 and this is all this structure does not 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.160
 We can vary the size move it etc very 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.160
 well then I hope you liked it
