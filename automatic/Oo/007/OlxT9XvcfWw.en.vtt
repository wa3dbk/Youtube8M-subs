 if you have ever tasted styrofoam 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.530
 or to spray styrodur 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.849
 then you probably already have 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.869
 observed as most spray paint the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.760
 mercilessly eat up and whet 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.180
 But there are exceptions I have here 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.160
 three different single-sum product 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.810
 from the hardware store here from renault where 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.980
 one of citadel a primer and 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.460
 I have this little baby here 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.820
 also found in the hardware store of dubli 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.560
 kalla an acrylic spray paint 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.540
 and that's what it's about 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.900
 something very special this little one 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.010
 baby is also very expensive 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.710
 while being here for his 400th 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 milliliter can in the middle in the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.110
 usually six euros about time in the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 Baumarkt I have for this little box 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.680
 and that's just the 150 or so I have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.740
 I think I paid seven or eight euros 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.010
 but I have seen on ebay there 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.620
 This spray also in 400 of the cans for 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.680
 ten or eleven euros 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.920
 the great thing about this product is this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920
 word 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 I'm going to break it down 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 the m this spray will kill you this 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 styrofoam and styrodur are not on that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.120
 the special 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.790
 an expensive fun but take yourselves 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.460
 a lot of work when you are off 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.320
 pieces of styrofoam through structure 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.790
 have tinkered and want to prime 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.330
 So just look if that's what you are looking for 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 interested in ebay or amazon or 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.659
