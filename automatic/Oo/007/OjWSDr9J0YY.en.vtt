60<00:05:55.810> maybe<00:05:56.139> eighteen<00:05:56.650> dollars<00:05:56.770> not<00:05:57.100> sure

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
60 maybe eighteen dollars not sure

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.310 
60 maybe eighteen dollars not sure

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
it's from urban so i would have been a

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.450 
it's from urban so i would have been a
lot<00:06:00.669> more<00:06:00.729> expensive<00:06:01.270> there<00:06:02.039> then<00:06:03.039> too<00:06:03.960> um<00:06:05.460> no

jacket<00:06:11.169> i<00:06:11.229> can't<00:06:11.470> tell<00:06:12.000> but<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.210> seems<00:06:13.750> like<00:06:14.080> it

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
jacket i can't tell but it seems like it

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.050 
jacket i can't tell but it seems like it
might<00:06:14.380> be<00:06:14.560> for<00:06:14.800> men<00:06:15.010> because<00:06:15.250> i<00:06:15.490> can't<00:06:15.760> button

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
might be for men because i can't button

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.790 
might be for men because i can't button
the<00:06:16.240> bottom<00:06:16.510> button<00:06:16.840> because<00:06:17.080> of<00:06:17.139> my<00:06:17.229> hips<00:06:17.410> so

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
the bottom button because of my hips so

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.500 
the bottom button because of my hips so
I<00:06:17.830> just<00:06:18.130> assume<00:06:18.520> but<00:06:18.970> it's<00:06:19.090> really<00:06:19.240> baggy

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.360 
I just assume but it's really baggy
elsewhere<00:06:20.050> so<00:06:20.710> I<00:06:20.770> assume<00:06:21.010> that<00:06:21.160> it<00:06:21.250> was

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
elsewhere so I assume that it was

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.779 
elsewhere so I assume that it was
originally<00:06:21.760> made<00:06:21.880> for<00:06:21.940> men<00:06:22.330> but<00:06:22.930> it's<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:23.789> denim
