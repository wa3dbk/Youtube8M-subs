and it does succeed in work but my

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.700 
and it does succeed in work but my
prediction<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:41.570> Sally<00:00:42.570> using<00:00:43.140> Donna's<00:00:43.530> magic

prediction on Sally using Donna's magic

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.190 
prediction on Sally using Donna's magic
which<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.120> she<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.480> able<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.870> create

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
which that's how she was able to create

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
which that's how she was able to create
the<00:00:46.350> flames<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.640> able<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> spill

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

to<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.170> Josh<00:00:49.559> back<00:00:49.879> I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to get Josh back I think it's going to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
to get Josh back I think it's going to
backfire<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.280> way<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.980> seems<00:00:56.280> like

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
backfire in some way it just seems like

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
backfire in some way it just seems like
that<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.510> prediction<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.559> her

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
that that's just my prediction on her

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
yeah but the reason why I was able to do

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
yeah but the reason why I was able to do
last<00:02:04.979> week's<00:02:05.369> episode<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.479> was

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
last week's episode was because I was

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.180 
last week's episode was because I was

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
because the frames per sec

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.350 
because the frames per sec
were<00:02:14.240> too<00:02:15.240> low<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:16.080> ran<00:02:16.320> 15<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.460> normal<00:02:18.240> is
