thank you very much for that we're going
to<00:00:23.480> retouch<00:00:24.380> on<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.860> subject<00:00:25.340> of

to retouch on the subject of
extraterrestrial<00:00:26.540> visitation<00:00:29.200> it<00:00:30.200> would

sometimes<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.140> will<00:02:20.260> see<00:02:20.290> newer<00:02:21.070> models<00:02:21.610> come

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
sometimes you will see newer models come

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.110 
sometimes you will see newer models come
in<00:02:22.740> but<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.860> may<00:02:24.010> still<00:02:24.310> represent<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> same

understand that you are humanoid and
that<00:06:43.920> the<00:06:44.160> greys<00:06:44.400> are<00:06:44.640> humanoid<00:06:45.090> in<00:06:45.300> that<00:06:45.480> they

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
that the greys are humanoid in that they

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
that the greys are humanoid in that they

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
human type inhabitant are they if so how

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.090 
human type inhabitant are they if so how
