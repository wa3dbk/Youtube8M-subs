see my my belief is backed up with

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.250 
see my my belief is backed up with
evidence<00:00:49.879> now<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.969> doesn't<00:00:51.300> directly<00:00:51.390> prove

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
evidence now it doesn't directly prove

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.740 
evidence now it doesn't directly prove
anything<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:53.100> terms<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.850> higher<00:00:54.180> power<00:00:54.449> or

anything in terms of a higher power or

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.889 
anything in terms of a higher power or
deity<00:00:55.550> but<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> does<00:00:56.910> prove<00:00:57.239> something<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
deity but it does prove something and it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.400 
deity but it does prove something and it
does<00:00:58.079> prove<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.219> special<00:01:00.410> thus

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
does prove that we are special thus

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.070 
does prove that we are special thus
prove<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:03.080> beyond<00:01:04.080> anything<00:01:04.350> else

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
prove that we are beyond anything else

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
prove that we are beyond anything else
now<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.170> may<00:01:07.320> ask<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.670> what

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
now you may ask why you know what what

now you may ask why you know what what
makes<00:01:09.270> us<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.689> special<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:13.290> science<00:01:13.830> has

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
makes us so special now science has

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310 
makes us so special now science has
taken<00:01:14.159> us<00:01:14.460> very<00:01:14.729> far<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> fields<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
taken us very far and in the fields of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.780 
taken us very far and in the fields of
astronomy<00:01:18.350> we've<00:01:19.350> we've<00:01:19.920> discovered<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.580> lot

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
astronomy we've we've discovered a lot

astronomy we've we've discovered a lot
about<00:01:21.119> space<00:01:22.939> me<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.479> amazed<00:01:25.229> by<00:01:25.970> by<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
about space me I'm amazed by by the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
about space me I'm amazed by by the
night<00:01:27.330> sky<00:01:28.579> science<00:01:29.579> has<00:01:29.700> proven<00:01:31.040> thus<00:01:32.040> far<00:01:32.340> as

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
night sky science has proven thus far as

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
night sky science has proven thus far as
we<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.030> science<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.659> always<00:01:33.900> evolving<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
we know science is always evolving it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
we know science is always evolving it
sort<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.950> shifting<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.549> shaping<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.119> moving

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
sort of shifting and shaping and moving

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.520 
sort of shifting and shaping and moving
around<00:01:36.920> thus<00:01:37.920> far<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.430> observed<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.410 

there<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> no<00:01:43.860> planet<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:45.360> Earth

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.330 

there<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> no<00:01:49.290> observable<00:01:49.950> planet<00:01:51.290> like<00:01:52.290> Earth

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.870 

and<00:01:55.429> there<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:56.659> no<00:01:57.079> sophisticated<00:01:58.039> life-forms

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and there is no sophisticated life-forms

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.279 
and there is no sophisticated life-forms
like<00:01:59.750> humans<00:02:01.539> now<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.570> lot<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.780> people<00:02:02.929> say<00:02:03.259> that

many<00:02:26.870> light-years<00:02:27.170> away<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:28.630> planet<00:02:29.630> was

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
many light-years away a planet was

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.530 
many light-years away a planet was
discovered<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.910> planet<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.390> was

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
discovered and the planet that was

discovered and the planet that was
discovered<00:02:33.400> resembled<00:02:34.400> almost<00:02:34.819> almost

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
discovered resembled almost almost

open I was amazed but there are a few
problems<00:02:46.519> with<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.819> planet<00:02:47.560> okay<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:50.090> just

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
problems with this planet okay they just

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.190 
problems with this planet okay they just
outright<00:02:50.750> suggested<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.700> 99%<00:02:52.700> sure<00:02:52.819> that

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
outright suggested that 99% sure that

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.140 
outright suggested that 99% sure that
there's<00:02:54.200> life-forms<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.040> planet<00:02:55.310> with

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
there's life-forms on that planet with

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.280 
there's life-forms on that planet with
absolutely<00:02:56.780> no<00:02:56.930> evidence<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.440> back<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.860> up

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
absolutely no evidence to back that up

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.740 
absolutely no evidence to back that up
furthermore<00:03:00.290> they<00:03:00.590> said<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:05.180> Sun<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
furthermore they said that the Sun and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.890 
furthermore they said that the Sun and
the<00:03:06.739> moon<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:08.780> no<00:03:08.989> effect<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.620> planet

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the moon have no effect on that planet

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.039 
the moon have no effect on that planet
it's<00:03:11.900> stationary<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.150> what<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.480> means<00:03:14.690> is

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
it's stationary so what that means is

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.199 
it's stationary so what that means is
that<00:03:15.760> half<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> planet<00:03:17.389> is<00:03:17.780> always<00:03:18.260> dark

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
that half of the planet is always dark

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.339 
that half of the planet is always dark
half<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.450> planet<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.019> always<00:03:21.319> bright<00:03:23.349> half

for<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.280> say<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.520> me<00:05:20.700> that<00:05:20.880> we<00:05:21.180> are<00:05:21.300> not

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
for you to say to me that we are not

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.350 
for you to say to me that we are not
special<00:05:24.260> well<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:26.310> evidence<00:05:26.430> suggests<00:05:27.300> that

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
special well the evidence suggests that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.990 
special well the evidence suggests that
we<00:05:27.570> are<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:29.190> maybe<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.580> time<00:05:29.789> that<00:05:29.820> you

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
we are so maybe it's time that you

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.170 
we are so maybe it's time that you
started<00:05:30.930> thinking<00:05:31.320> twice<00:05:31.530> about<00:05:31.919> this<00:05:32.729> home

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
started thinking twice about this home

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.300 
started thinking twice about this home
that<00:05:33.660> you're<00:05:33.840> living<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.849> this<00:05:35.849> shell<00:05:37.160> in<00:05:38.160> the

that you're living in this shell in the
universe

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
universe

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.390 
universe
start<00:05:41.639> thinking<00:05:41.940> about<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:43.039> because<00:05:44.039> to<00:05:44.370> me

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
start thinking about that because to me

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.969 
start thinking about that because to me
these<00:05:44.910> are<00:05:45.150> two<00:05:45.300> very<00:05:45.330> strong<00:05:45.599> points<00:05:46.289> for<00:05:46.620> why

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
these are two very strong points for why

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.010 
these are two very strong points for why
I<00:05:47.010> believe<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.789> we<00:05:48.000> are<00:05:49.099> gifted<00:05:50.539> our<00:05:51.539> life<00:05:51.810> is

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
I believe that we are gifted our life is

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.580 
I believe that we are gifted our life is
a<00:05:52.050> gift<00:05:53.090> and<00:05:54.090> our<00:05:54.240> home<00:05:54.450> is<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.720> gift<00:05:54.930> despite

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
a gift and our home is the gift despite
