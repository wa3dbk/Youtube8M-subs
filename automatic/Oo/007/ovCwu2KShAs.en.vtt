00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
split limbs the advantage of a split

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.310 
split limbs the advantage of a split
split<00:02:12.100> Liam<00:02:12.310> system<00:02:12.760> as<00:02:12.940> opposed<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.989> solid

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
split Liam system as opposed to a solid

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.500 
split Liam system as opposed to a solid
limb<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.739> these<00:02:15.519> limbs<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.150> different

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
limb is these limbs can be different

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.280 
limb is these limbs can be different
ways

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
ways

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.619 
ways
so<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.189> rid<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.489> CamLAN<00:02:19.000> issues<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
so you get rid of the CamLAN issues that

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.020 
so you get rid of the CamLAN issues that
you<00:02:19.689> from<00:02:19.840> normally<00:02:20.110> find<00:02:20.319> on<00:02:20.470> bose<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.760> limb

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you from normally find on bose this limb

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.729 
you from normally find on bose this limb
will<00:02:22.239> be<00:02:22.360> slightly<00:02:22.750> heavier<00:02:23.079> than<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.439> limb

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
will be slightly heavier than this limb

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.399 
will be slightly heavier than this limb
and<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.579> down<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.390> really<00:02:26.079> love<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
and so on down here I really love the

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.170 
and so on down here I really love the
weight<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.799> bow<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.489> very<00:02:27.730> easy<00:02:27.879> bow

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
weight of the bow it's a very easy bow

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.030 
weight of the bow it's a very easy bow
to<00:02:28.239> shoot<00:02:28.569> it's<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:29.019> smooth<00:02:29.409> it's<00:02:29.709> not<00:02:29.920> as

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
to shoot it's very smooth it's not as

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
to shoot it's very smooth it's not as
fast<00:02:30.310> as<00:02:30.700> some<00:02:30.849> of<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.030> bows<00:02:31.209> like<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.510> PSA

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
fast as some of the bows like the PSA

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
fast as some of the bows like the PSA
full-throttle<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.069> very<00:02:33.280> easy<00:02:33.579> to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
full-throttle but it's very easy to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.280 
full-throttle but it's very easy to
shoot<00:02:33.940> one<00:02:34.090> thing<00:02:34.269> about<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.599> bow<00:02:34.840> which<00:02:35.140> I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
shoot one thing about this bow which I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.089 
shoot one thing about this bow which I
don't<00:02:35.349> like<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.079> ability<00:02:38.409> to<00:02:38.620> fit<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> bow

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
don't like is the ability to fit a bow

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.309 
don't like is the ability to fit a bow
quiver<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> bow<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.269> can<00:02:40.840> fit<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.200> bow

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
quiver to the bow you can fit the bow

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.899 
quiver to the bow you can fit the bow
quiver<00:02:41.590> where<00:02:41.769> your<00:02:41.890> site<00:02:42.099> normally<00:02:42.370> mounts

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
quiver where your site normally mounts

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.539 
quiver where your site normally mounts
and<00:02:43.659> that's<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.959> one-piece<00:02:44.409> quiver<00:02:44.739> but

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
and that's a one-piece quiver but

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.830 
and that's a one-piece quiver but
fitting<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:45.909> two-piece<00:02:46.390> quiver<00:02:46.750> you're

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
fitting a two-piece quiver you're

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.069 
fitting a two-piece quiver you're
limited<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.439> this<00:02:47.560> point<00:02:48.069> here<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.870> you'd

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
limited to this point here I think you'd

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.440 
limited to this point here I think you'd
be<00:02:50.230> better<00:02:50.549> with<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.579> two-piece<00:02:52.060> mount

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
be better with a two-piece mount

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.229 
be better with a two-piece mount

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
somewhere on the riser here we can bolt

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.289 
somewhere on the riser here we can bolt
it<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.530> saying<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.790> problem<00:02:58.150> with

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
it but saying that the problem with

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.520 
it but saying that the problem with
fitting<00:02:58.629> a<00:02:58.659> quiver<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.170> bow<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.440> it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
fitting a quiver to the bow is it

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.990 
fitting a quiver to the bow is it
affects<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.010> balance<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.459> bow<00:03:00.579> tends<00:03:00.909> to

affects the balance of the bow tends to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.479 
affects the balance of the bow tends to
land<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.299> bow<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.629> side<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.340> affects<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
land the bow to the side and affects the

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.890 
land the bow to the side and affects the
way<00:03:03.579> the<00:03:03.700> bow<00:03:03.849> shoots<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.329> I<00:03:04.389> tend<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.750> shoot

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
way the bow shoots so I tend to shoot

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.110 
way the bow shoots so I tend to shoot
with<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.109> hip<00:03:05.260> quiver<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.829> my<00:03:05.980> hip<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.400> for

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
with the hip quiver on my hip and for

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.140 
with the hip quiver on my hip and for
hunting<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.889> still<00:03:08.889> prefer<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.430> arrows<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:09.940> be

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
hunting I still prefer the arrows to be

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.580 
hunting I still prefer the arrows to be
on<00:03:10.239> my<00:03:10.329> hip<00:03:10.540> because<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.959> doesn't<00:03:11.200> affect<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
on my hip because it doesn't affect the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.170 
on my hip because it doesn't affect the
weight<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.310> bow<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.700> balance<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
you can for the quiver there but it

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.809 
you can for the quiver there but it
pushes<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.720> weight<00:03:34.930> out<00:03:35.139> bore<00:03:35.470> but<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
pushes the weight out bore but it's a

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.539 
pushes the weight out bore but it's a
nice<00:03:37.060> easy<00:03:37.389> bow<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.900> shoot<00:03:38.260> I'm<00:03:38.919> happy<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.400> own

red<00:03:43.690> bow<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:44.799> just<00:03:45.010> think<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.310> red<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
red bow and I just think the red and

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.819 
red bow and I just think the red and
black<00:03:45.730> strings<00:03:46.239> are<00:03:46.540> not<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.139> right<00:03:47.319> color<00:03:47.530> it

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
black strings are not the right color it

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.220 
black strings are not the right color it
should<00:03:47.980> be<00:03:48.099> red<00:03:48.310> with<00:03:48.430> black<00:03:48.750> psee<00:03:49.750> used<00:03:50.109> to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
should be red with black psee used to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.199 
should be red with black psee used to
produce<00:03:50.410> red<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.859> black<00:03:51.010> bows<00:03:51.280> strings<00:03:52.060> on

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
produce red and black bows strings on

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.729 
produce red and black bows strings on
all<00:03:52.299> their<00:03:52.480> bows<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.959> now<00:03:53.230> for<00:03:53.440> their<00:03:53.560> blue

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
all their bows and now for their blue

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.379 
all their bows and now for their blue
bows<00:03:53.980> they<00:03:54.250> have<00:03:54.400> blue<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:54.760> black<00:03:54.910> strings

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
bows they have blue and black strings

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.199 
bows they have blue and black strings
red<00:03:56.319> they<00:03:56.859> have<00:03:57.010> red<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.340> black<00:03:57.459> strings<00:03:57.940> I

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
red they have red and black strings I

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.960 
red they have red and black strings I
think<00:03:58.690> Martin<00:03:59.139> should<00:03:59.440> have<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.709> same<00:03:59.970> but

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970

stabilizer<00:04:32.350> off<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.770> normally<00:04:33.070> shoot<00:04:33.100> with

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
stabilizer off I normally shoot with

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.680 
stabilizer off I normally shoot with
stabilizer<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.990> longer<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.500> stabilizer<00:04:36.160> and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
stabilizer the longer the stabilizer and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.850 
stabilizer the longer the stabilizer and
the<00:04:37.690> more<00:04:37.870> weight<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.140> have<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:38.650> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
the more weight you have it then the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.470 
the more weight you have it then the
more<00:04:38.950> stable<00:04:39.190> you're<00:04:39.520> shooting<00:04:39.910> because<00:04:40.240> it

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
more stable you're shooting because it

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.950 
more stable you're shooting because it
takes<00:04:41.170> your<00:04:41.380> oscillations<00:04:41.980> out<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.250> your<00:04:42.370> hand

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
takes your oscillations out of your hand

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.270 
takes your oscillations out of your hand
but<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.020> think<00:04:44.170> it's<00:04:44.290> important<00:04:44.800> for<00:04:44.890> lots<00:04:45.130> of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
but I think it's important for lots of

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.890 
but I think it's important for lots of
bow<00:04:45.460> hunters<00:04:45.880> they<00:04:46.120> don't<00:04:46.330> want<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.720> weight

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
bow hunters they don't want the weight

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.680 
bow hunters they don't want the weight
they<00:04:47.440> shoot<00:04:47.650> closer<00:04:47.950> distances<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:49.390> see<00:04:49.540> how

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
they shoot closer distances to see how

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.900 
they shoot closer distances to see how
this<00:04:49.810> both<00:04:50.050> feels<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.590> shoot<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.670> see<00:04:51.790> the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
this both feels to shoot and to see the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.430 
this both feels to shoot and to see the
vibration<00:04:52.420> in<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.510> bone<00:04:52.690> when<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:52.900> shoot<00:04:53.140> it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440
