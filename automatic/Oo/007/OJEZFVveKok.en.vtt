cannons now yes all of our cannons are
maxed<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.620> town<00:00:34.620> 08<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.579> our<00:00:35.610> mortars

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
maxed out for town 08 as are our mortars

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.900 
maxed out for town 08 as are our mortars
and<00:00:36.690> our<00:00:37.140> wizards<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.430> left<00:00:38.460> now

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and our wizards so all we have left now

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.690 
and our wizards so all we have left now
is<00:00:39.210> Archer<00:00:39.780> towers<00:00:40.219> Tesla's<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> our<00:00:44.340> air

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
is Archer towers Tesla's and and our air

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.720 
is Archer towers Tesla's and and our air
defenses<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:46.559> could<00:00:46.800> upgrade<00:00:47.010> an<00:00:47.280> air<00:00:47.430> defense

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
defenses we could upgrade an air defense

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.650 
defenses we could upgrade an air defense
but<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.239> too<00:00:48.420> worried<00:00:48.600> about

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
but I'm not really too worried about

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.170 
but I'm not really too worried about
that<00:00:48.899> thing<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.530> with

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
that thing I'm going to go with

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.439 
that thing I'm going to go with
upgrading<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.530> Tesla<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:53.039> um<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.969> why<00:00:54.239> don't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
upgrading a Tesla first um so why don't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
upgrading a Tesla first um so why don't
we<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.719> ahead<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:56.370> guess<00:00:57.090> we'll<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
we go ahead and I guess we'll just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180 
we go ahead and I guess we'll just
upgrade<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.100> we'll

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
upgrade this one right here so we'll

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
upgrade this one right here so we'll
start<00:00:59.489> off<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> video<00:01:00.140> upgrading<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.530> our

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
start off the video upgrading one of our

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.420 
start off the video upgrading one of our
Tesla's<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.589> let's<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.280> can

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
Tesla's and then let's see if we can

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.810 
Tesla's and then let's see if we can
research<00:01:06.000> anything<00:01:07.159> we<00:01:08.159> can't<00:01:08.490> research

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
research anything we can't research

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460 
research anything we can't research
anything<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.840> why<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.290> go

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
anything right now but why don't we go

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890 
anything right now but why don't we go
ahead<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.369> an<00:01:11.520> attack<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.240> we're<00:01:12.810> gonna

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
ahead and get an attack in we're gonna

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.840 
ahead and get an attack in we're gonna
go<00:01:12.990> ahead<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.229> attack<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.340> elixir

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
go ahead and attack see how much elixir

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.380 
go ahead and attack see how much elixir
we<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.180> find<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.439> maybe<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.220> maybe<00:01:17.610> we

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
we can find and then maybe just maybe we

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.160 
we can find and then maybe just maybe we
will<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.930> able<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> find<00:01:19.860> enough<00:01:20.640> elixir<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.810> at

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
will be able to find enough elixir in at

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.490 
will be able to find enough elixir in at
least<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.740> maybe<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.159> raids<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.570> get<00:01:25.080> enough

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
least one maybe two raids to get enough

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
least one maybe two raids to get enough
to<00:01:26.040> upgrade<00:01:26.580> maybe<00:01:26.820> our<00:01:27.030> wall<00:01:27.330> breakers<00:01:27.659> or

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to upgrade maybe our wall breakers or

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
to upgrade maybe our wall breakers or
something<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.259> look<00:01:28.650> at<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.400> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
something like that look at this this is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460 
something like that look at this this is
exactly<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.329> talking<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.350> we're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
exactly what I'm talking about so we're

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.810 
exactly what I'm talking about so we're
going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.680> ahead<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.040> drop<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.490> our

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
going to go ahead and just drop down our

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.480 
going to go ahead and just drop down our
barbarians<00:01:33.630> right<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.350> our<00:01:34.920> archers

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
barbarians right here and our archers

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160 
barbarians right here and our archers
and<00:01:35.520> let's<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.090> how<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.960> get

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and let's see how much of this we get

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
and let's see how much of this we get
before<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.740> drop<00:01:37.920> down<00:01:37.979> too<00:01:38.460> many<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.759> our

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
before we drop down too many of our

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.810 
before we drop down too many of our
troops<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> see<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.640> we

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
troops because I do want to see if we

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
troops because I do want to see if we
can<00:01:41.970> save<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.750> hopefully<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> second

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
can save some and hopefully get a second

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
can save some and hopefully get a second
attack<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.369> without<00:01:44.939> having<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> train<00:01:45.659> up

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
attack in without having to train up

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.260 
attack in without having to train up
anything<00:01:46.170> else<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:48.119> really

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
anything else so we got a really really

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
anything else so we got a really really
good<00:01:48.659> amount<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.290> elixir<00:01:49.710> from<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.040> I'm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
good amount of elixir from that I'm

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.889 
good amount of elixir from that I'm
going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> go<00:01:50.369> ahead<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.640> drop<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:51.119> those

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
going to go ahead and drop down those

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.660 
going to go ahead and drop down those
barbarians<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.649> distraction<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.399> let's<00:01:53.549> see

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
barbarians as distraction and let's see

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.450 
barbarians as distraction and let's see

this this is amazing just to find right

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.099 
this this is amazing just to find right
after<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.079> awesome<00:03:37.590> raid<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.340> had

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
go ahead and spam them out ah so they

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.390 
go ahead and spam them out ah so they
get<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.959> here<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.230> spread<00:03:43.560> out<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:43.829> don't<00:03:44.069> think

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
get in here and spread out I don't think

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.849 
get in here and spread out I don't think
they're<00:03:44.519> even<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.880> range<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.569> many<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.709> those

they're even in a range of many of those

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.680 
they're even in a range of many of those
mortars<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:47.880> should<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.180> able<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.480> get<00:03:48.660> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
mortars so we should be able to get a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.160 
mortars so we should be able to get a
good<00:03:49.170> amount<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.859> all<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.400> loot<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.850> here

good amount of all this loot in here
which<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.319> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.590> be<00:03:52.680> awesome<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.310> looks

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
which is going to be awesome it looks

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.190 
which is going to be awesome it looks
like<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.579> bunch<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> elixir<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.989> those

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
like a bunch of the elixir is in those

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.620 
like a bunch of the elixir is in those
storages<00:03:55.920> but<00:03:56.250> I'm<00:03:56.400> not<00:03:56.579> really<00:03:56.760> too<00:03:57.269> too

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
storages but I'm not really too too

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.530 
storages but I'm not really too too
worried<00:03:58.079> about<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.380> because<00:03:59.269> from<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.359> look

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
worried about that because from the look

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.199 
worried about that because from the look
of<00:04:00.660> things<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:02.340> should<00:04:02.549> have<00:04:02.670> enough<00:04:02.970> troops

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
of things we should have enough troops

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.849 
of things we should have enough troops
to<00:04:03.630> spread<00:04:04.139> out<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.560> get<00:04:05.069> us<00:04:06.410> get<00:04:07.410> us<00:04:07.560> some<00:04:07.829> of

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
to spread out and get us get us some of

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.770 
to spread out and get us get us some of
that<00:04:08.099> extra<00:04:08.609> elixir<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.209> we<00:04:09.329> already<00:04:09.510> reached

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
that extra elixir so we already reached

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.300 
that extra elixir so we already reached
the<00:04:09.900> amana<00:04:10.109> looks<00:04:10.319> as<00:04:10.380> if<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.560> needed<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.919> in

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the amana looks as if we needed to in

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.479 
the amana looks as if we needed to in
two<00:04:12.000> raids<00:04:12.329> but<00:04:12.780> keep<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.440> mind<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.739> was<00:04:13.980> only

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
two raids but keep in mind that was only

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.430 
two raids but keep in mind that was only
one<00:04:14.819> army<00:04:15.269> comp<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.720> was<00:04:15.840> trained<00:04:16.139> up<00:04:16.289> we

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
one army comp that was trained up we

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.890

were just able to be lucky enough to
find<00:04:18.930> what<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:20.010> found<00:04:20.220> in<00:04:20.489> those<00:04:20.639> first<00:04:20.880> two

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180

attacks<00:04:21.659> which<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.140> pretty<00:04:22.380> rare<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:22.950> I

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
attacks which is pretty rare but I

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.740 
attacks which is pretty rare but I
always<00:04:23.250> love<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.490> when<00:04:23.640> when<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.360> does<00:04:24.510> happen

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750
