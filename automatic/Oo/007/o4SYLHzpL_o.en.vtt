00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.900
 Protection units do not gain expense 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.180

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.569
 here with your help you can get it out 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.870

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.510
 The only thing I know is that it's a 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.660
 new disease coming from a 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.910
 laboratory 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.550

 five minutes five minutes or three is 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.160
 risky being without weapons on this site 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.620
 we can not be so confident 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.630
