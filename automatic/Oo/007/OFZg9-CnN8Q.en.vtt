 technology implemented more or less in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.430
 2001 for this guy over the clean tone and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 he went after the producers of

 videogame to offer this technology 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.840

 microsoft executive took into 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.059
 the company they did not like the idea 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.039
 will not pose naked in 3 we prefer 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.680
 control even then leaves you very quiet 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.870

 You know that we can do this. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.729
 feasible control technology 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 commercially it is that you can leave 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.960
 cheap technology 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.600

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.290
 future 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.869
 I threw the children then because 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 issue of copyright as soon as 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.369
 I succeeded to enter 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.250
 this control inside the nintendo had 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.500
 some electoral disputes that were 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.570
 done but beauty then touched I 'm going to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.369
 me having after much discussion and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.619

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.720
 next console then nintendo has accepted 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.979
 This motto is very cool. 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.079
 the documentary to leave the inscription 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.850

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.659
 detail of philips with copyrights 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.729
 and everything else then there's something that 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.459
 two large companies both microsoft 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.709
 sony playstation they refused the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.650
 could have been very successful could have 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.890
 beaten 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.110
 of sales that was will but there is no 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.209
 The head of the nintendo folks are very 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.150
 more open even knowing this question 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.700
 that control would not be feasible 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.709
 commercially would not be cheap 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.750
 they made such a large number of 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.599
 controls that got cheap became feasible 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 sister made adaptations there and left a 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.530
