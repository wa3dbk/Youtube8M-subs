it<00:01:06.470> out<00:01:06.619> into<00:01:06.680> two<00:01:07.100> parts<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.670> first<00:01:08.090> part

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
it out into two parts the first part

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.010 
it out into two parts the first part
will<00:01:08.750> be<00:01:08.780> on<00:01:09.280> on<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:11.330> highest<00:01:11.690> possible

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
will be on on the highest possible

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.070 
will be on on the highest possible
setting<00:01:12.409> rough<00:01:13.190> spot<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.670> will<00:01:14.390> be<00:01:14.540> on<00:01:14.780> the
