up your skills and because of this kind
of<00:03:41.540> mechanic<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:42.980> need<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.520> run<00:03:43.670> delay<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.360> the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
of mechanic you need to run delay in the

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.890 
of mechanic you need to run delay in the
team<00:03:44.750> because<00:03:45.320> if<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:46.070> take<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.459> hit<00:03:46.700> and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
team because if you take a hit and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.510 
team because if you take a hit and
enemies<00:03:47.900> at<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.230> one-timer<00:03:48.650> you're<00:03:49.370> just

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
enemies at the one-timer you're just

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.830 
enemies at the one-timer you're just
gonna<00:03:49.640> keep<00:03:49.820> on<00:03:49.970> taking<00:03:50.150> hits<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.690> you'll

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
gonna keep on taking hits and you'll

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.300 
gonna keep on taking hits and you'll
never<00:03:50.959> be<00:03:51.140> able<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.320> kill<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.590> enemy<00:03:51.860> but

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
never be able to kill the enemy but

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.460 
never be able to kill the enemy but
running<00:03:52.880> delay<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.660> good<00:03:53.989> thing<00:03:54.200> especially

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
running delay is a good thing especially

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.430 
running delay is a good thing especially
echidna<00:03:55.310> because<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> kid<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.360> has<00:03:56.570> massive

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
recovery which you need for the team to

recovery which you need for the team to
stall<00:03:59.570> with<00:03:59.750> it's<00:03:59.989> just<00:04:00.230> an<00:04:00.410> incredibly

well-rounded team and I like the way it

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.380 
well-rounded team and I like the way it
functions<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.860> run<00:04:04.070> Val<00:04:04.730> converging<00:04:05.300> the

points<00:05:21.010> I've<00:05:21.790> seen<00:05:21.970> what<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.150> Valkyrie<00:05:22.570> I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
points I've seen what the Valkyrie I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.720 
points I've seen what the Valkyrie I
don't<00:05:22.840> use<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.560> Valkyrie<00:05:23.920> team<00:05:24.130> at<00:05:24.340> all

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
don't use the Valkyrie team at all

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.400 
don't use the Valkyrie team at all
because<00:05:25.120> it's<00:05:25.360> just<00:05:25.510> easier<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.960> form<00:05:26.290> with

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
because it's just easier to form with

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.490 
because it's just easier to form with
Zeus<00:05:26.680> but<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.790> Valkyrie<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:28.180> have<00:05:28.420> is<00:05:28.600> plus<00:05:28.930> 297

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
Zeus but the Valkyrie I have is plus 297

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.770 
Zeus but the Valkyrie I have is plus 297
so<00:05:30.190> if<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.430> see<00:05:30.700> some<00:05:30.940> daiquiri<00:05:31.330> friends

so if I see some daiquiri friends

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.780 
so if I see some daiquiri friends
recently<00:05:32.320> active<00:05:32.950> I'll<00:05:33.100> throw<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.430> Valkyrie

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
recently active I'll throw the Valkyrie

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.990 
recently active I'll throw the Valkyrie
up<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.260> hopefully<00:05:35.260> they<00:05:35.590> use<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.830> plus<00:05:36.520> 297

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
up and hopefully they use a plus 297

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.940 
up and hopefully they use a plus 297
Valkyrie<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.690> get<00:05:38.230> power<00:05:38.380> points<00:05:38.710> off<00:05:38.800> that

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950

my monster box is not that good the

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.660 
my monster box is not that good the
levels<00:06:03.130> are<00:06:03.280> good<00:06:03.460> but<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:05.500> variety<00:06:05.680> it's

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
levels are good but the variety it's

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.550 
levels are good but the variety it's
okay<00:06:07.090> I<00:06:07.120> wish<00:06:07.660> I<00:06:07.780> rolled<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.230> rare<00:06:08.410> egg

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560

machine<00:06:08.590> more<00:06:09.040> but<00:06:09.310> then<00:06:09.430> I<00:06:09.460> wish<00:06:09.670> I<00:06:09.790> didn't

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
machine more but then I wish I didn't

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.380 
machine more but then I wish I didn't
because<00:06:10.510> it's<00:06:11.410> just<00:06:11.650> better<00:06:12.010> I<00:06:12.370> think<00:06:12.670> to

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
because it's just better I think to

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.750 
because it's just better I think to
spend<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.320> stones<00:06:14.590> on<00:06:14.770> stamina<00:06:15.010> refill<00:06:15.490> and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
spend the stones on stamina refill and

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.470 
spend the stones on stamina refill and
get<00:06:16.570> ranks<00:06:16.990> which<00:06:17.170> is<00:06:17.290> more<00:06:17.470> stamina<00:06:17.770> and<00:06:18.480> in

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
get ranks which is more stamina and in

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.050 
get ranks which is more stamina and in
turn<00:06:19.780> you<00:06:20.110> get<00:06:20.350> a<00:06:20.710> handful<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.340> plus<00:06:21.610> eggs<00:06:21.880> it's

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
turn you get a handful of plus eggs it's

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.430 
turn you get a handful of plus eggs it's
just<00:06:22.210> better<00:06:22.390> than<00:06:22.570> rolling<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.900> mystic<00:06:23.200> knight

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
just better than rolling a mystic knight

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.470 
just better than rolling a mystic knight
or<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:24.160> golem<00:06:25.000> or<00:06:25.090> something<00:06:25.360> like<00:06:25.420> that

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
or a golem or something like that

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.740 
or a golem or something like that

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
alright check this out I'm gonna use the

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.710 
alright check this out I'm gonna use the
verge<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.290> a<00:06:30.100> Valcke<00:06:30.340> to<00:06:30.700> change<00:06:31.000> a<00:06:31.240> majority

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720
