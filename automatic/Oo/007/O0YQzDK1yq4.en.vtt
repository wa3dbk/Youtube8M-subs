00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.930
 Good day to all dear 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.450
 viewers 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.370
 glad to welcome you to the new 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.590
 the sixteenth editions of the anime gaze so 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.110
 it turned out that the acne code is sick and this one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.510
 review for you I will spend Snezhik kun 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 Today we will talk about the beautiful anime 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.920
 Kanokon I would like to immediately note that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.780
 the work contains such genres 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 how to go mystic 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.640
 romance comedy and of course the school 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.730
 if you like all these elements 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 sit down together or even use 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.920
 more comfortable and we start the plot begins 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.899
 narration with a guy named aima 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 Dakota who lived without parents in 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 ancient with her grandfather and in recent 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.649
 time moved to the city in the eyes immediately 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
 the fact that the protagonist is not 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.570
 looks especially courageous rather even 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.460
 looks like a child is certainly not 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 would you call an alpha male but he 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 pretty cute shy on arrival at 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.420
 city photo goes to high school where 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.370
 gets acquainted with a local high school student 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 minamoto cheaters that immediately 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.049
 declares to his eyes that he is the love of all 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.390
 her life and begins to solicit in every way 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.119
 before him sometimes using secret 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.240
 female reception of course female beauty 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.400
 what are you thinking about in general everything is pretty 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.850
 strange but practice shows 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.110
 the main oddities are still ahead 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 especially given the presence of such 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
 genre as mystic 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 so here during the next secret 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 meeting through the hole and code and in class 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 after lessons the guy learns that minamoto 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.070
 not just beautiful and komsomolka and with 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.530
 its highlight in our case girl 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.770
 turned out to be a spirit and foxes to the word very and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.049
 very lustful foxes afterwards we 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 we also learn that in school besides chizuru 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.799
 there are some other perfumes with 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 who our heroes in the course of the series 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.140
 will also intersect what I want 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 note so this is a nice opening by 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.400
 subjective opinion it is made 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.860
 Great panache looks cute and 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.079
 abundance of problems does not suffer even 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.110
 considering that the anime is relatively 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.540
 long time the picture looks really 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.329
 qualitatively with regards to bohs all here 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.549
 rather ambiguous as simply as 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.459
 in rosario + vampire and many others 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.120
 anime genre these heroes after talking to 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.580
 enemy 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.330
 show their solitude and give lyuley 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.250
 rival 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.560
 although it is worth noting that sometimes it is 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.569
 It looks even impressive but still up to 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.940
 full-fledged fight hardly falls short 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.720
 bonus to everything after each fight 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.030
 the main character shows how we are 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 we have good anime which is just 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.230
 smells of kindness and innocence 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.799
 protagonist and lust in 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.989
 foxes 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.409
 There are many more bonus factors that 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.720
 add golter graph worth seeing 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.519
 interesting characters funny jokes and how 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.590
 said earlier just nice 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.060
 the atmosphere recommends it all to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.489
 view this title 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.099
 Anime Kanokon clearly can become a good 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.739
 busy weekend and if you have a bad 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.680
 mood then rest assured that kanokon

 you will be lifted by him 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.459
 serious plot drama stories and when 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.950
 the fuss of the magician is not me the picture may not 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.720
 like but because for the sake of epic 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.900
 and beyond the thoughtful plot is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.540
 watch these and not for the sake of relaxation but on 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.810
