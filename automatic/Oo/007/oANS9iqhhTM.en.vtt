she's voice acting and a film like this
is<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.500> kind<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.950> pure<00:00:08.760> form<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.570> acting

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
is that kind of a pure form of acting

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.470 
is that kind of a pure form of acting
because<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.519> strictly<00:00:11.519> imagination<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
because it's strictly imagination or is

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480 
because it's strictly imagination or is
it<00:00:12.690> more<00:00:12.960> difficult<00:00:13.590> because<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.190> have

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it more difficult because you don't have

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.849 
it more difficult because you don't have
you<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.420> people<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.260> things<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> kind<00:00:16.830> of

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
you know people and things to kind of

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.210 
you know people and things to kind of
play<00:00:17.070> off<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.990> know<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.439> either<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.920> those

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
play off of I know that either of those

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.939 
play off of I know that either of those
this<00:00:20.520> exactly<00:00:21.090> right<00:00:21.180> or<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.800> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
this exactly right or or that that you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.769 
this exactly right or or that that you
can<00:00:23.130> even<00:00:23.310> necessarily<00:00:23.850> compare<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:24.750> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
can even necessarily compare because I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.990 
can even necessarily compare because I
think<00:00:24.900> especially<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.189> animated<00:00:26.640> movie

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
think especially in this animated movie

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.210 
think especially in this animated movie
where<00:00:27.210> these<00:00:27.480> characters<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.619> supposed<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
where these characters are supposed to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
where these characters are supposed to
be<00:00:29.400> real<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.449> they're<00:00:30.720> you're<00:00:30.900> not

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

be real you know they're you're not
doing<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> goofy<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.809> accent<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.100> know

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
cartoony funny voice that would maybe be

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.400 
cartoony funny voice that would maybe be
a<00:00:38.640> different<00:00:38.969> scenario<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.809> you're

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
down a little bit though on the the fact

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.429 
down a little bit though on the the fact
that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> played<00:01:15.780> three<00:01:16.110> different

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that you played three different

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
that you played three different
characters<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
characters is it which one was the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
characters is it which one was the
tougher<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.530> imagine<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.280> my

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
tougher one I would imagine just my

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.960 
tougher one I would imagine just my
guess<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.020> regular<00:01:22.950> mother<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.850> know

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
guess that the regular mother you know

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.870 
guess that the regular mother you know
is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.479> tougher<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:26.250> ordinary

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
is the tougher one because it's ordinary

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
is the tougher one because it's ordinary
at<00:01:27.000> least<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
at least with the with the you know the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
at least with the with the you know the
other<00:01:29.220> mother<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> then<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.060> she<00:01:30.210> becomes

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
other mother and then when she becomes

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
other mother and then when she becomes
kind<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:31.110> monstrous<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> kind

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
kind of more monstrous you have to kind

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
kind of more monstrous you have to kind
of<00:01:32.939> maybe<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.780> broader<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.500> how

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of maybe get a little broader with how

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.550 
of maybe get a little broader with how
you<00:01:34.710> play<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:36.180> honor<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.079> truth<00:01:37.290> there

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you play it is my honor the truth there

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.980 
you play it is my honor the truth there
uh<00:01:38.570> yes<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.600> maybe<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.409> different<00:01:40.799> reasons<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
uh yes but maybe for different reasons I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.950 
uh yes but maybe for different reasons I
felt<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:44.009> other<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.939> real<00:01:45.360> mother<00:01:45.689> well

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
felt like the other the real mother well

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
felt like the other the real mother well
none<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> them<00:01:46.409> were<00:01:46.680> extensions<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> Terry's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
none of them were extensions of Terry's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
none of them were extensions of Terry's
so<00:01:48.060> from<00:01:48.299> an<00:01:48.420> acting<00:01:48.750> point<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> view<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.829> was

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
so from an acting point of view it was

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
so from an acting point of view it was
fun<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.579> imagine<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.329> these<00:01:51.479> people

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
fun to just imagine all these people

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
fun to just imagine all these people
they<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.350> wasn't<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.220> kind<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
they that wasn't one of the kind of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
they that wasn't one of the kind of
roles<00:01:53.850> where<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.450> draw<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:54.960> something<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
roles where you draw on something that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.780 
roles where you draw on something that
you've<00:01:56.250> experienced<00:01:56.909> yourself<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.460> from
