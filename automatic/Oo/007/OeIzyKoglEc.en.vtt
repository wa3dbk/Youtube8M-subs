am<00:01:01.140> removing<00:01:01.440> take<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> pry<00:01:02.670> tool<00:01:02.700> to<00:01:03.630> lift<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
am removing take a pry tool to lift it

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.620 
am removing take a pry tool to lift it
up<00:01:04.170> from<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> basis<00:01:05.160> basically<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
up from the basis basically like a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
up from the basis basically like a
magnetized<00:01:07.500> attachment<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:08.399> you<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.729> need

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
magnetized attachment so you just need

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
magnetized attachment so you just need
to<00:01:09.149> run<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.630> pry<00:01:10.259> tool<00:01:11.030> under<00:01:12.030> needed<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.750> lift

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to run a pry tool under needed to lift

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.760 
to run a pry tool under needed to lift
it<00:01:13.259> up<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.979> frame<00:01:14.930> having<00:01:15.930> removed<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it up from the frame having removed that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.609 
it up from the frame having removed that
one<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.280> another<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.259> caused<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
one there's another one that caused the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.730 
one there's another one that caused the
video<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.390> frames<00:01:21.899> we<00:01:22.140> gotta<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.500> careful

one side and then fold it over to make
the<00:01:55.929> fundamental

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
the fundamental

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.290

as you can see unpalatable where example

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.850 
as you can see unpalatable where example
video<00:02:02.260> feed<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.630> need<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:05.140> flip<00:02:05.830> it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
video feed is and you need to flip it

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.540 
video feed is and you need to flip it
over<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.520> one<00:02:06.729> side<00:02:06.760> gently<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.860> not<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.280> break

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
over to one side gently so not to break

cable

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.949 

so<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.810> need<00:02:18.079> to<00:02:18.230> get<00:02:18.439> remission<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:19.220> load<00:02:19.489> off

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
so you need to get remission a load off

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.729 
so you need to get remission a load off
and<00:02:20.959> then<00:02:21.319> put<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.040> side<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:24.110> then<00:02:24.500> we

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
and then put it to one side and then we

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.300 
and then put it to one side and then we
simply<00:02:25.010> through<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.700> Bible<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:27.769> send<00:02:28.159> it

having done that didn't need to free the
baseboard<00:02:42.810> from<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.140> digitizer<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.010> goes

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
baseboard from the digitizer and goes

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.910 
baseboard from the digitizer and goes
our<00:02:45.700> hair<00:02:45.970> together<00:02:46.150> with<00:02:47.020> some<00:02:47.170> very<00:02:47.440> strong
