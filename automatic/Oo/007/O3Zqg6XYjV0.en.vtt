today<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:01.079> are<00:00:01.260> reviewing<00:00:01.610> Tetris<00:00:02.610> which<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
today we are reviewing Tetris which is a

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.919 
today we are reviewing Tetris which is a
cat<00:00:05.250> scratcher<00:00:06.049> modular<00:00:07.049> furniture<00:00:07.519> system

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
cat scratcher modular furniture system

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.980 
cat scratcher modular furniture system
so<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.950> made<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.639> several<00:00:12.599> different

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
so it is made of several different

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.570 
so it is made of several different
pieces<00:00:13.170> while<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.799> can<00:00:13.920> buy<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.130> pieces

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
pieces while you can buy the pieces

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.330 
pieces while you can buy the pieces
individually<00:00:14.900> but<00:00:15.900> there<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.350> five<00:00:16.680> total

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
individually but there are five total

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.590 
individually but there are five total
that<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.600> sell<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.670> real<00:00:20.670> quick<00:00:20.939> I'll<00:00:21.240> move

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
that they sell and real quick I'll move

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.130 
that they sell and real quick I'll move
out<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> way<00:00:21.960> um<00:00:22.789> there<00:00:23.789> I'll<00:00:24.240> explain<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
out of the way um there I'll explain the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.960 
out of the way um there I'll explain the
different<00:00:25.500> like<00:00:25.769> sizes<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> shapes<00:00:26.699> later

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
different like sizes and shapes later

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.599 
different like sizes and shapes later
but<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.160> reason<00:00:29.460> it's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
but you can see that the reason it's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.240 
but you can see that the reason it's
called<00:00:29.670> cat<00:00:30.060> wrist<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.720> very<00:00:30.810> much<00:00:31.080> like

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
called cat wrist is it's very much like

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
called cat wrist is it's very much like
Tetris<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:33.149> game<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.320> who<00:00:34.980> started

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
Tetris the game I don't know who started

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700 
Tetris the game I don't know who started
Tetris<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.480> anyway<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> game<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.649> was

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
Tetris but anyway it was a game that was

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
Tetris but anyway it was a game that was
on<00:00:37.860> Gameboy<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.030> still

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
on Gameboy and I think you can still

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.889 
on Gameboy and I think you can still
play<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.600> computers<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.350> whatnot<00:00:40.649> um<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
play it on computers and whatnot um and

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
play it on computers and whatnot um and
so<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.200> were<00:00:43.320> good<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.680> game<00:00:44.070> then

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so if you were good at that game then

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
so if you were good at that game then
you<00:00:44.579> would<00:00:44.700> love<00:00:44.969> love<00:00:45.629> love<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.200> because

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you would love love love this because

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.889 
you would love love love this because
you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.430> put<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.570> many<00:00:48.629> different

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you can put it in so many different

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.130 
you can put it in so many different
formations<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.090> during<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> video<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.660> will

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
formations and during this video I will

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.299 
formations and during this video I will
show<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.379> some<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> different

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
show you some of the different

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
show you some of the different
formations<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.570> put<00:00:54.809> together<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
formations that we put together but the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
formations that we put together but the
way<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.699> has<00:00:56.879> worked<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.180> really

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
way that this has worked out really

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
way that this has worked out really
great<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.930> us<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:59.399> um<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.899> trig<00:01:01.829> likes

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
great for us is that um this trig likes

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
great for us is that um this trig likes
to<00:01:02.190> come<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.640> last<00:01:02.969> step<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.690> step

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to come to this last step and then step

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.160 
to come to this last step and then step
right<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.299> scratch<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
right on this and then scratch in the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.280 
right on this and then scratch in the
morning<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:09.119> liked<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.960> height

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
morning so I really liked it this height

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
morning so I really liked it this height
for<00:01:10.830> us<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> usually<00:01:11.970> there's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> chair<00:01:12.750> right

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
for us and usually there's a chair right

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.330 
for us and usually there's a chair right
here<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.990> it's<00:01:15.990> able<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.470> stay<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.159> way

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
here so it's able to stay out of the way

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.390 
here so it's able to stay out of the way
and<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.210> also<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.900> carpet<00:01:19.320> ends<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> then

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and I also my carpet ends here and then

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
and I also my carpet ends here and then
hardwood<00:01:20.759> floor<00:01:20.970> begins<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.930> just

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
hardwood floor begins there so it's just

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
hardwood floor begins there so it's just
enough<00:01:22.350> space<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.880> well<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
enough space for that as well all the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
enough space for that as well all the
pieces<00:01:25.259> are<00:01:25.650> secured<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.610> they're<00:01:26.729> individual

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
pieces are secured so they're individual

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.880 
pieces are secured so they're individual
and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.689> they're<00:01:27.810> secured<00:01:28.290> together<00:01:28.500> with

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and then they're secured together with

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950 
and then they're secured together with
these<00:01:29.100> clips<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.759> there's<00:01:30.299> several<00:01:30.540> clips

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
these clips and there's several clips

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
these clips and there's several clips
that<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.200> sent<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.619> each<00:01:31.890> piece<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
that are sent with each piece so that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.859 
that are sent with each piece so that
you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:34.640> finagle<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:36.030> however<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you can finagle them however you need to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.100 
you can finagle them however you need to
based<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:38.579> you've<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.420> kachra<00:01:39.659> set

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
based on how you've got your kachra set

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
based on how you've got your kachra set
up<00:01:40.320> though<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.430> five<00:01:41.670> different

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
up though there are five different

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
up though there are five different
pieces<00:01:42.299> um<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:45.409> t<00:01:46.409> shape<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.829> z

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
pieces um there is the t shape the z

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.849 
pieces um there is the t shape the z
shape<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.740> eye<00:01:52.770> shape

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.819 

the<00:01:57.859> l-shape<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.920> lastly<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.490> O<00:02:01.520> shape<00:02:02.829> you

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
the l-shape and lastly the O shape you

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.309 
the l-shape and lastly the O shape you
think<00:02:04.130> bum<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.829> can<00:02:07.130> get<00:02:07.280> any<00:02:08.319> combination

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
think bum so you can get any combination

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.360 
think bum so you can get any combination
of<00:02:09.379> these<00:02:09.560> however<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.250> want<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.640> do<00:02:10.819> it<00:02:10.970> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
of these however you want to do it and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.619 
of these however you want to do it and
put<00:02:13.370> them<00:02:13.519> together<00:02:13.640> however<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.180> want<00:02:14.450> so

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
put them together however you want so

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.360 
put them together however you want so
I'm<00:02:14.870> going<00:02:15.049> to<00:02:15.080> put<00:02:15.230> together<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.799> couple<00:02:16.220> of

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I'm going to put together a couple of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.150 
I'm going to put together a couple of
different<00:02:16.819> scenarios<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:18.319> take<00:02:18.799> pictures<00:02:18.980> of

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
different scenarios and take pictures of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.199 
different scenarios and take pictures of
them<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:20.390> our<00:02:20.900> review<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:22.310> wanted<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.030> show

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209

now I'm going to kind of show you a
close-up<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.920> what<00:02:28.099> they<00:02:28.250> look<00:02:28.430> like<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.940> like

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
close-up of what they look like so like

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.800 
close-up of what they look like so like
all<00:02:29.650> cardboard<00:02:30.650> scratchers<00:02:31.340> um<00:02:31.760> they<00:02:32.540> have

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
all cardboard scratchers um they have

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.920 
all cardboard scratchers um they have
one<00:02:33.650> side<00:02:34.010> that's<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.579> this<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.329> then

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
one side that's like this and then

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.470 
one side that's like this and then
another<00:02:36.590> side<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:39.410> this<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:41.299> this

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
another side that is like this and this

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.059 
another side that is like this and this
is<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.750> side<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.440> cats<00:02:42.709> are<00:02:42.890> going<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
is a side that the cats are going to

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.339 
is a side that the cats are going to
want<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.280> scratch<00:02:43.610> on<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.140> really

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
want to scratch on and this is really

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.569 
want to scratch on and this is really
good<00:02:45.829> quality<00:02:46.750> cardboard<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.470> eco-friendly

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
good quality cardboard it's eco-friendly

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.210 
good quality cardboard it's eco-friendly
it's<00:02:49.880> made<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.239> 90%<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:51.230> post-consumer

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's made of 90% and post-consumer

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.250 
it's made of 90% and post-consumer
recycled<00:02:52.790> materials<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:53.930> they<00:02:54.049> also

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
recycled materials and then they also

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.300 
recycled materials and then they also
use<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:55.010> safe<00:02:55.610> glue<00:02:56.260> Katra<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.500> our<00:02:57.829> paper<00:02:58.040> cut

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
use a safe glue Katra so our paper cut

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.280 
use a safe glue Katra so our paper cut
labs<00:02:58.549> that<00:02:58.760> make<00:02:58.910> sketches<00:02:59.150> says<00:02:59.660> don't<00:02:59.930> stack

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
labs that make sketches says don't stack

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.930 
labs that make sketches says don't stack
more<00:03:00.889> than<00:03:01.100> five<00:03:01.450> pieces<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.630> cat<00:03:02.930> res<00:03:03.200> high

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
more than five pieces of cat res high

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.520 
more than five pieces of cat res high
and<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:05.660> think<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.019> just<00:03:06.139> a<00:03:06.290> safety

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
and I think that's just a safety

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.629 
and I think that's just a safety
precaution<00:03:08.500> okay<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.560> for<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:09.980> purpose<00:03:10.340> of

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
precaution okay so for the purpose of

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.680 
precaution okay so for the purpose of
the<00:03:11.329> review<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:12.049> have<00:03:12.650> been<00:03:13.030> putting<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.450> cat

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
the review I have been putting the cat

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.620 
the review I have been putting the cat
resan<00:03:15.109> to<00:03:15.290> different<00:03:15.940> scenarios<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.480> is

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
resan to different scenarios and this is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.120 
resan to different scenarios and this is
one<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.959> scenarios<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.739> came<00:03:18.799> up<00:03:19.100> with

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
one of the scenarios that I came up with

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.580 
one of the scenarios that I came up with
it's<00:03:19.639> not<00:03:20.090> five<00:03:20.510> captures<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.139> high<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.440> one

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
it's not five captures as high it's one

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.830 
it's not five captures as high it's one
two<00:03:21.799> three<00:03:22.190> high<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:23.569> it's<00:03:23.959> almost<00:03:25.329> I'm<00:03:26.329> five

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
two three high and it's almost I'm five

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.949 
two three high and it's almost I'm five
nine<00:03:27.319> and<00:03:27.349> my<00:03:27.910> head<00:03:28.910> starts<00:03:29.389> here

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
nine and my head starts here

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.610 
nine and my head starts here
so<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:32.120> also<00:03:32.480> put<00:03:32.660> together<00:03:32.780> pretty<00:03:33.230> poorly

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
so it's also put together pretty poorly

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.180 
so it's also put together pretty poorly
because<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.780> put<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.870> together<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.620> bit<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.069> a

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
because I put it together and bit of a

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.270 
because I put it together and bit of a
hurry<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:38.150> um<00:03:38.389> that<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.730> one<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.150> kind<00:03:42.109> of

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
hurry but um that is one of the kind of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.870 
hurry but um that is one of the kind of
harder<00:03:43.280> things<00:03:43.549> about<00:03:43.819> catches<00:03:44.329> is<00:03:45.880> lining

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
harder things about catches is lining

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.930 
harder things about catches is lining
them<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.120> because<00:03:47.989> they<00:03:48.950> get<00:03:49.130> kind<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.519> snagged

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
them up because they get kind of snagged

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.440 
them up because they get kind of snagged
here<00:03:50.930> or<00:03:51.169> snagged<00:03:51.560> there<00:03:52.280> but<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.060> can't<00:03:53.299> get

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
here or snagged there but you can't get

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.520 
here or snagged there but you can't get
them<00:03:53.540> done<00:03:53.720> it's<00:03:53.989> just<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.319> know<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.440> couple

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
them done it's just you know a couple

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.220 
them done it's just you know a couple
extra<00:03:55.099> seconds<00:03:55.489> or<00:03:55.639> whatever<00:03:55.910> since<00:03:56.389> they<00:03:56.989> are

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
extra seconds or whatever since they are

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.259 
extra seconds or whatever since they are
a<00:03:57.620> dual-purpose<00:03:58.870> cardboard<00:03:59.870> scratcher<00:04:00.290> and

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
a dual-purpose cardboard scratcher and

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.960 
a dual-purpose cardboard scratcher and
furniture<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:03.500> if<00:04:03.709> they<00:04:03.829> were<00:04:03.889> like<00:04:04.130> smooth

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
furniture so if they were like smooth

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.650 
furniture so if they were like smooth
plastic<00:04:05.479> for<00:04:05.690> example<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.650> wouldn't<00:04:06.919> have

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
plastic for example you wouldn't have

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.290 
plastic for example you wouldn't have
of<00:04:07.780> an<00:04:08.020> issue<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:09.520> I<00:04:09.730> wanted<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.090> show

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
of an issue and then I wanted to show

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.250 
of an issue and then I wanted to show
these<00:04:10.480> clips<00:04:10.810> up<00:04:11.080> close<00:04:11.410> as<00:04:11.680> well<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.090> can

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
these clips up close as well so I can

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.740 
these clips up close as well so I can
line<00:04:14.670> these<00:04:15.670> clips<00:04:16.090> really<00:04:16.720> are<00:04:17.050> easy<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:18.750> snap

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
line these clips really are easy to snap

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.040 
line these clips really are easy to snap
on<00:04:20.970> once<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.120> have<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:23.340> cardboard<00:04:24.340> lined<00:04:24.580> up

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
on once you have the cardboard lined up

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.360 
on once you have the cardboard lined up
and<00:04:26.490> then<00:04:27.960> they<00:04:28.960> have<00:04:29.200> these<00:04:29.470> little<00:04:29.830> teeth<00:04:30.130> on

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
and then they have these little teeth on

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.450 
and then they have these little teeth on
the<00:04:30.490> side<00:04:30.760> here<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.420> make<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.350> easy<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:34.020> just

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
the side here that make it easy to just

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.220 
the side here that make it easy to just
they<00:04:36.460> grip<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.060> cardboard<00:04:37.750> almost<00:04:38.080> by

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
they grip the cardboard almost by

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.790 
they grip the cardboard almost by
themselves<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:40.170> they<00:04:41.170> come<00:04:41.350> with<00:04:41.470> two<00:04:41.650> or

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
themselves and they come with two or

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.470 
themselves and they come with two or
three<00:04:41.830> each<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.460> can't<00:04:42.640> remember<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.180> if<00:04:43.330> you

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
three each I can't remember but if you

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
and if it's a downside it just depends

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.530 
and if it's a downside it just depends

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
conscious concept and if I had kids I

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.839 
conscious concept and if I had kids I
would<00:06:25.569> totally<00:06:25.990> get<00:06:26.589> one<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:26.919> these<00:06:27.580> setups

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
would totally get one of these setups

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.820 
would totally get one of these setups
for<00:06:28.209> their<00:06:28.360> room<00:06:28.629> because<00:06:29.289> I<00:06:29.409> think<00:06:29.469> they
