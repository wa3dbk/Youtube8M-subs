it I feel like it is a dupe for the mac
prolongwear<00:01:53.130> concealer<00:01:53.600> because<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.079> doesn't

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
prolongwear concealer because it doesn't

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
prolongwear concealer because it doesn't
crease<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.250> stays<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.700> day<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
crease and it just stays on all day and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.380 
crease and it just stays on all day and
so<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.200> such<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.040> concealer<00:01:59.729> especially

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so it's such a good concealer especially

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
so it's such a good concealer especially
for<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> price<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.380> paying<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.490> if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
for the price that you're paying so if

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.149 
for the price that you're paying so if
you<00:02:03.090> can't<00:02:03.329> afford<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.810> splash<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.740> Mac

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
