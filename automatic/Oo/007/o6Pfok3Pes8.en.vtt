00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
mixture I'm doing this slowly because I

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.380 
mixture I'm doing this slowly because I
tried<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.370> many<00:02:27.430> different<00:02:27.730> ways<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
tried this so many different ways and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.910 
tried this so many different ways and
what<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> things<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.230> realized<00:02:29.650> was

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
what are the things that I realized was

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.790 
what are the things that I realized was
this<00:02:30.580> mixture<00:02:31.150> was<00:02:31.420> not<00:02:31.660> happy<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.350> any<00:02:32.590> way

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
this mixture was not happy in any way

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.830 
this mixture was not happy in any way
shape<00:02:33.040> or<00:02:33.250> form<00:02:33.310> if<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.880> added<00:02:34.270> ingredients

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
shape or form if you added ingredients

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.350 
shape or form if you added ingredients
too<00:02:35.020> quickly<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:36.370> whisk<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.090> with<00:02:37.330> a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
too quickly so just whisk this in with a

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.730 
too quickly so just whisk this in with a
fork

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.170 

at<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:44.950> point<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.400> make<00:02:45.640> sure<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.000> done

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
at this point you make sure it's done

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.880 
at this point you make sure it's done

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it is a little bit messy because you

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.780 
it is a little bit messy because you
can't<00:02:53.970> pour<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.600> clean<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.050> edges

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
because with sugar you need to dissolve

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.530 
because with sugar you need to dissolve
it<00:03:45.319> into<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.680> liquid<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.549> doesn't<00:03:46.939> dissolve<00:03:47.060> it
