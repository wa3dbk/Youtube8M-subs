guided look that in the pencils can
leave<00:02:30.790> harsh<00:02:31.090> lines<00:02:31.420> sometimes<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:32.680> at<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
leave harsh lines sometimes but at the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.010 
leave harsh lines sometimes but at the

with<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:43.140> Tikku<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> spoolie<00:02:44.560> I'm<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:45.130> going

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
with it Tikku a spoolie I'm just going

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.760 
with it Tikku a spoolie I'm just going
to<00:02:45.730> comb<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> through<00:02:46.210> my<00:02:46.510> brows<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.560> would

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
to comb it through my brows this would

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.070 
to comb it through my brows this would
basically<00:02:47.950> remove<00:02:48.580> all<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.000> harsh<00:02:49.240> edges<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
basically remove all the harsh edges and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.190 
basically remove all the harsh edges and
would<00:02:50.700> blend<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.880> eye<00:02:51.910> shadows<00:02:52.420> really<00:02:52.570> well

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
would blend the eye shadows really well

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.560 
would blend the eye shadows really well
okay<00:02:54.130> now<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.340> step<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.910> completely<00:02:55.420> optional

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
okay now the step is completely optional

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.500 
okay now the step is completely optional
but<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.830> seek<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.760> more<00:02:57.940> defined

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
but if you seek for the more defined

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.810 
but if you seek for the more defined
eyebrows<00:02:59.170> then<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.830> always<00:03:00.040> opt<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.640> for

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
eyebrows then you can always opt in for

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.380

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
step is completely optional but calling

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.370 
step is completely optional but calling
to<00:03:24.610> me<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.940> does<00:03:25.210> make<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> lot<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.780> difference

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
to me it does make a lot of difference

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.530

and<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.070> am<00:03:27.250> going<00:03:27.580> for<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.790> special<00:03:28.120> function

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
and if I am going for a special function

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.740
