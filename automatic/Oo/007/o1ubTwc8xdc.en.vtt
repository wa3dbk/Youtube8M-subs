there's<00:00:55.929> also<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.379> new<00:00:56.469> block<00:00:56.890> called<00:00:57.219> ash

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
there's also a new block called ash

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.389 
there's also a new block called ash
block<00:00:57.969> now<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.690> will<00:00:59.050> hear<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.469> sizzling<00:01:00.039> sound

thing<00:01:07.600> model<00:01:08.170> also<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:10.690> glitch<00:01:11.020> with

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
thing model also this is a glitch with

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.800 
thing model also this is a glitch with
this<00:01:11.409> there's<00:01:11.920> some<00:01:12.159> blocks<00:01:12.550> on<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.210> which<00:01:13.570> are

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
this there's some blocks on it which are

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.200 
this there's some blocks on it which are
bouncing<00:01:14.590> right<00:01:14.740> now<00:01:15.010> so<00:01:15.490> that's<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.880> glitch

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
bouncing right now so that's a glitch

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.959 
bouncing right now so that's a glitch
with<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.780> but<00:01:17.049> it's<00:01:17.500> not<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:17.860> mod<00:01:18.340> it's<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
with it but it's not the mod it's the

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.560 
with it but it's not the mod it's the
minecraft<00:01:19.659> it's<00:01:20.619> just<00:01:20.920> because<00:01:21.219> the<00:01:21.490> block<00:01:22.270> is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
minecraft it's just because the block is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.990 
minecraft it's just because the block is
too<00:01:22.930> small<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.500> that's<00:01:24.040> what<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.369> mod<00:01:24.579> creator

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
too small so that's what the mod creator

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 
too small so that's what the mod creator
says<00:01:25.210> hopefully<00:01:25.750> can<00:01:26.049> get<00:01:26.229> fixed<00:01:26.680> later<00:01:26.860> on

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
says hopefully can get fixed later on

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.029 
says hopefully can get fixed later on
but<00:01:27.850> it's<00:01:28.360> still<00:01:28.600> cool<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.500> can<00:01:29.649> hear<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
but it's still cool it you can hear the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.029 
but it's still cool it you can hear the
sizzling<00:01:30.369> sound<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.079> adds<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.590> really

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
sizzling sound and it it adds and really

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.880 
sizzling sound and it it adds and really
stick<00:01:33.250> effect<00:01:33.729> on<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.329> explosion<00:01:35.229> let's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
stick effect on to the explosion let's

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.609 
stick effect on to the explosion let's
try<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.250> out<00:01:36.399> with<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.729> creeper<00:01:37.210> now<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.689> the

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
try it out with the creeper now and the

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.499 
try it out with the creeper now and the
explosion<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.490> paper<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.030> same<00:01:40.270> thing

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
explosion of the paper is the same thing

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.050 
explosion of the paper is the same thing
as<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.680> can<00:01:41.829> see<00:01:41.979> there's<00:01:42.250> five<00:01:42.579> particle

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
as you can see there's five particle

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.719 
as you can see there's five particle
effects<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.539> smoke<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.320> also<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.829> ash<00:01:45.009> now

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
effects and smoke and also the ash now

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.389 
effects and smoke and also the ash now
when<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:45.909> talk<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> little<00:01:46.329> bit<00:01:46.539> about<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
when I talk a little bit about the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.060 
when I talk a little bit about the
effects<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> particle<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:50.649> there's<00:01:50.829> five

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
effects of the particle so there's five

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.929 
effects of the particle so there's five
particle<00:01:51.520> effects<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.750> also<00:01:53.200> sets<00:01:53.590> on

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
particle effects this it also sets on

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.819 
particle effects this it also sets on
trees<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.240> vulnerable<00:01:55.630> blocks<00:01:55.929> higher<00:01:56.560> than

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
trees and vulnerable blocks higher than

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.399 
trees and vulnerable blocks higher than
the<00:01:57.039> explosion<00:01:57.729> on<00:01:57.820> fire<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:59.079> it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
the explosion on fire then it's

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.270 
the explosion on fire then it's
longer-lasting<00:02:00.070> small

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
longer-lasting small

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.060 
longer-lasting small
ash<00:02:02.280> blocks<00:02:02.789> tall<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> smoke<00:02:04.070> randomly

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
ash blocks tall the smoke randomly

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.669 
ash blocks tall the smoke randomly
generated<00:02:05.609> destruction<00:02:06.240> size<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
generated destruction size and the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.969 
generated destruction size and the
dramatic<00:02:08.459> smoke<00:02:09.090> color<00:02:09.509> changes<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
dramatic smoke color changes also the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.820 
dramatic smoke color changes also the
