00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey and welcome back to the new 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 follow offer map pack 2 in the last 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 we want to conclude now that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.900
 we started a long time ago 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.179
 I carry all of this with me 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.030
 what will need now and that the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.039
 whole fragments of this very long 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.910
 travel through different dimensions 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.080
 against various bosses opponents and through 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.550
 many drove many 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.269
 the most beautiful of simply the mails 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.269
 transporter 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.150
 unfortunately I have the last time after 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.590
 we completed the quest and me 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.570
 the recording finished my world 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.760
 lost but as far as I know happened 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.080
 not so special anymore in this one 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.790
 The departure is a completely new 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.290
 dimension is but there is no real 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.640
 quest or a boss anymore but only 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.300
 other good things like us 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.370
 watch fast 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.980
 I also have this ebook 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.629
 your hand because you simply use the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.190
 quests customers can the wiener shift 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.800
 click on it then we would all have 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.899
 heads or now just not back 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.979
 head himself would be for this last one 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.680
 Crossing is about 55 cows and about 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.660
 100 penguins traded but killed with the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.490
 ace transporter we want now in 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.080
 The world we are going to deal with 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.910
 comes a right-click function is quite 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.090
 just that you do not even want to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.920
 good to know and she has to go first 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.210
 I do not know how to load the world 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.640
 Looks like I'm assuming that 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.750
 is a kind of maze and is like me 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.590
 has already mentioned that is now 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.780
 last episode 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.380
 because we did it and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.810
 For the last time we have been mine 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.979
 a few torches 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.330
 because you have noticed the ender kite 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.330
 defeated yes I know we eaten right away 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:02:00.979
 So that's a labyrinth with one 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.680
 desert okay i am from the hot packs myself 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.990
 The idea was very enthusiastic 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.970
 I found it very good in my opinion 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.770
 the implementation in many points as well 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.920
 very good bit boring it was 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.150
 because of many because that simply because 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.690
 it was too easy for itself 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.790
 had 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.580
 through all the colors of the equipment 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.910
 and a bit boring, too 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.160
 what is this quest at some 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:32.780
 ask we say something that yes 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:34.970
 that's just there so hunt eleven times 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.760
 the end Christians the air works 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.810
 apparently quite well since even yet 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.560
 something the air in the shade now what something 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.510
 well no matter 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 there seem to be quite a few here 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.760
 different biome like for example 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.470
 this wonderful nice no better desert 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.260
 here there but is something with comic 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.110
 share the air here as a symbol 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.320
 are attached and that has become one 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.079
 output or the like are interesting 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.600
 here an ice with him what this completely 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.450
 colorful want everything or as something for that 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.170
 see that leaves are located 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.440
 many leaves 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:25.100
 there we have a lot of colorful wool and 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.170
 there we have a gap this way and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.130
 what do we have because that's right 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.329

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:41.019
 bayonet from lucky look lucky yet 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.019
 blocks exists that is that 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.080
 that's a bit crass hello 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.390
 Let's not break the lucky blogs 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.740
 I wanted to use that 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.180
 just go away 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.670
 you come edged the wheels pieces 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.070
 In any case very interesting 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.480
 the whole of your opinion would look 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.190
 I would like to be interested here 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.600
 born and I villiger not me 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.720
 aggressive when I have the names 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.790
 sharon a big no is so bad 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.130
 because circle because you're a lyon 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.640
 Lena does not prefer to take bitter 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.910
 yes yes, you can also do so next to jolanta 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.230
 so we just bring to harm you 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.230
 not alone 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.350
 we can also be a cheaper one 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.120
 Now we are very pretty you have to 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.470
 yes let's say we want to say that 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.150
 take down a few blocks 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:43.400
 eat and a yeti okay an yeti the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.900
 while the spawn are interesting here 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.820
 new effects because on the lucky blogs 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.870
 on it in the map pack 1 against the body 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.480
 relatively easy to take apart 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.920
 our wonderful sword here 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 this is not a challenger wise 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.240
 if you use lucky blogs you would 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.460
 because then pretty much could pack though 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.590
 such a job sport or something but us 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.350
 new effects seem to be at the same time 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.350
 for example, that just wow 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:16.400
 what is that so has a few that can 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.200
 I'm not just me right now 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.450
 let it come come here 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.400
 wanted screenshot of you as well 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.260
 always that good I know something has done 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.800
 definitely gets a thumbs up 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.960
 for that enough screenshot has died now 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.850
 they also cause a huge explosion 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.560
 one or are all silverfish ok 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.560
 help me lucky blocks 5 million 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.460
 there was a chasm there 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.300
 fell for overjoyed 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.300
 help me 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:06:00.140
 save me a god is born quite a lot 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.390
 pretty bad things with what we do 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.520
 Of course it is also possible to try out 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:15.020
 yes times shift to hold 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:17.690
 and okay if my plus lucky blogs 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.640
 not so good we have such a few birds 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.620
 behind us that does not yet have 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.610
 In any case, I think the whole thing 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.810
 very nice motto pack I'm happy 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.920
 on the third part simply because that 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.400
 something newer is because you have something like that 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.450
 In that sense, I'm not what I mean 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.250
 or at least not really mad yet 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.780
 Of course, pack 1 was available but I found it 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.250
 so far a shame because many mausklicks 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.420
 are based on the same and that is one 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.880
 welcome change in any case 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.860
 even with this little reward now 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.850
 seen here in the end 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.960
 I feel hungry when I do that 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.220
 seeing ourselves heal ourselves automatically 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.240
 always the whole time or leave 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.870
 just a little bit around 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.250
 sprint 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:58.010
 we always get straight for example 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:59.720
 good again I think 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.880
 every time you can with the lucky blogs 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.230
 have a lot of fun here if you 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.600
 wanted to fill in himself then installed 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.720
 Just do not let this one come to me 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.060
 back god wants some luck 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.420
 make it back in time - 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.180
 218 dead 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.350
 yes that fits well with rainbow 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.550
 just died as you are there 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.980
 below can already read in chat 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.040
 we have a score of a few 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.350
 this would have to score 26 million 442,000 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.980
 733 points are possible spawn times 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.290
 back home 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.790
 that was it from this wonderful 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.410
 Project like I 'm sorry for people 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.880
 has even addressed one 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.640
 also look at the development process 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.050
 we will see that but for that 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.080
 map pack 2 it was that I hope you 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.490
 had fun a project like me and yours 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 like the comments as before 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.150
 already mentioned and see us 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.690
 next time until then and 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.690
 pat
