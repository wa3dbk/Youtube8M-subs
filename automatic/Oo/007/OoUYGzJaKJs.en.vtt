00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.320
 well a bit desperate when the scary music around the critters 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 Pop up 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.189
 I had a few tips 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.359
 Fourth, bat full as well as me 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.569
 it can not shoot well at Tomb Raider and I have 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.609
 Also always panic free if this music turns up points and a monster 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.210
 look around the corner 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.440
 sweeps 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.220
 the Kirchenmann heart palpitations 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.220
 I'm not cowardly I'm not that one of the actually 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.000
 Dames like to shoot from the background with a bow and arrow or skating 1 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.460
 I avoid confrontation 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.200
 and here's thinking 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.630
 at Midas 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.990
 just jump in the pool 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
 and the three big parties 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.340
 the one is hiding there 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.070
 but up here under the west 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 to follow in the stands 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.480
 at least all together 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.620
 stand alone 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.690
 we have to squat as close together as possible 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 and now you have to irritate tv 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.350
 in which 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.060
 always on the spot from the pool rises Wosik Council are not 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.870
 and that's what she'll wear so much at some point 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.780
 no longer knowing where to go with her 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 and given a desperate act 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.039
 This can sometimes take a while but you are somehow safe there 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.430
 Thank you said that and still 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.950
 because percent 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.570
 Ehrmann one can accelerate a bit but that always depends 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.090
 how close they are to each other 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.380
 now it could work 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.940
 Galler 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.680
 in that moment 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 where they come in contact with the water they are dead 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.229
 This saves nerves and ammunition 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.359
 is the safest way to cope with the lucky one already 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.000
 The DAX is also always just going to apply its often a put maybe 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.399
 one alone with the food more difficult so come now 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.029
 just not quite but the same 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.979
 can clearly come years Nauroder the axle break 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.790
 he does not stay the third of the over 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.860
 So far, I have not been able to turn it around the funny way 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.660
 shoot 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.080
 and that is a very embarrassing story for me 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.439
 this one had Berlin 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.929
 Not shot 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:53.709
 or mousse t 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.589
 GeVestor de 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.399
 this one 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.259
 it just stops 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.259
 Yes 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.619
 but with enough stamina is done high 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:10.999
 as I said 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.899
 for the scene 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.119
 There is no alternative, you really only have to deal with one 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.469
 to grapple 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.139
 and that is in doubt 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.289
 much less scary
