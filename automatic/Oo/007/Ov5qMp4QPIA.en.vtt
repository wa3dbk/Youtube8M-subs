Hi guys, this is Max Tapper again for HowCast.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.100
And what I'm going to show you guys how to
do today, is a standing cable row.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.250
This row is going to be targeted at working
your lats, your biceps, your rear delts, your

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.930
rhomboids, everything in that area.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.831
And we're also going to have a little bit
of load on our legs, so we're going to get

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.000
a small amount of work there, too.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.080
But let me show you how that's going to look,
Okay?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.980
So we're going to use this cable machine.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.590
We're going to grab a hold, and we're going
to actually give ourselves a nice dip.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.530
So we need to have our knees bent, our hips
out, take that pressure off our lower back.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.970
So now we're just going to row, back.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.950
Slow forward, allow your shoulders to retract.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.770
Pinch, row, slow out, shoulders forward again,
slow back, pinch.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.540
Now, that is a standing cable row.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.510
The standing cable row is an excellent exercise,
but because of the requirements on your legs

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.110
and your lower back, you're not going to be
able to lift a huge, huge, huge amount of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.110
weight.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
So this would not be one of the main exercises
that I would choose to focus on your back.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.470
I would still do something like a seated row,
pull-up, pull-down, this would be a peripheral

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.250
exercise that I would do after that.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.670
But this is definitely an excellent exercise,
targets a lot of other muscles and it also

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.860
targets your legs and your core at the same
time, while it's touching your big back muscles.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.659
In an exercise like this, I love to work in
the rep range of between ten and 12.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.400
Basically, ten and 12, is the hypertrophy
range, where you actually build a lot bigger

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.900
muscles, and you also get stronger.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.400
So ten to 12 is a range I love to be in.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.560
Let's put as much weight as you can possibly
handle up to ten to 12, in perfect, perfect

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
form.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
Okay?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.300
So if you start to lose your balance and lean
forward, the weight's too heavy.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.950
So basically what you're going to be doing
by sitting down is counter-balancing whatever's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.939
going on here, and allowing yourself to work
your lats.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:53.939
Alright?

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.939
So guys, remember.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.670
This is not going to be one of the prime movers.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.009
This is definitely not one of the exercises
that you can lift tons and tons of weight

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.409
on, because of the requirement on your other
muscles.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.009
But it's definitely an excellent one, and
it's something that you should put into your

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.540
back workout.
