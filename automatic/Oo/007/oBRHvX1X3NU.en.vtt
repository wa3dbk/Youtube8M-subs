to throw a net very simple easy way you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.020 
to throw a net very simple easy way you
can<00:00:49.800> throw<00:00:51.020> anywhere<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.410> 3-foot<00:00:53.010> net<00:00:53.310> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
can throw anywhere from a 3-foot net so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
can throw anywhere from a 3-foot net so
about<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.240> 7-foot<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> same<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.860> I'm

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
about a 7-foot and that the same way I'm

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.350 
about a 7-foot and that the same way I'm
throwing<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.490> it's<00:00:56.700> probably<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.060> easiest

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
you guys how I do step by step very easy

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.880 
you guys how I do step by step very easy
now<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.450> small<00:01:03.900> coils<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.619> people<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
now do small coils a lot of people do

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
now do small coils a lot of people do
because<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.759> reason<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.329> caught

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
because of some reason they get caught

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.399 
because of some reason they get caught
up<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.920> my<00:01:07.920> weights<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> net<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
up and my weights in the net so this is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.030 
up and my weights in the net so this is
how<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.740> it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this small coil it now when I cast this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.440 
this small coil it now when I cast this
man<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.370> probably<00:01:14.610> won't<00:01:14.760> really<00:01:15.000> catch<00:01:15.240> any

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
