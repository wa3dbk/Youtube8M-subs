00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to pull it and let's see if I can just

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
to pull it and let's see if I can just
get<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.720> off<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.320> piece<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:35.990> okay

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
get this all off in one piece here okay

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
get this all off in one piece here okay
so<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.409> setting<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.009> plastic

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the layout of the packaging for this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
the layout of the packaging for this
seventh<00:01:46.500> generation<00:01:46.950> iPod<00:01:47.220> Nano<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.670> nearly

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
seventh generation iPod Nano is nearly

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.389 
seventh generation iPod Nano is nearly
identical<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.530> iPod<00:01:50.009> Touch<00:01:50.159> 5th

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
identical to that of the iPod Touch 5th

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
identical to that of the iPod Touch 5th
generation<00:01:50.720> obviously<00:01:51.720> though<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> much

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
generation obviously though it is much

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
generation obviously though it is much
bigger<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.829> accommodate<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.430> bigger<00:01:53.610> device

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
bigger to accommodate the bigger device

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.990 
bigger to accommodate the bigger device
now<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.899> many<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.590> may<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.700> first

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
now as many of you may think at first

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690 
now as many of you may think at first
this<00:01:57.570> looks<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> smaller<00:01:58.619> iPod<00:01:59.369> Touch

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this looks like a smaller iPod Touch

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
this looks like a smaller iPod Touch
however<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> case<00:02:01.350> because

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
however that is not the case because

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.459 
however that is not the case because
this<00:02:01.979> does<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.399> run<00:02:02.790> iOS<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.780> runs<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> custom

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this does not run iOS it runs a custom

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.399 
this does not run iOS it runs a custom
version<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> standard<00:02:06.210> iPod<00:02:07.079> nano

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.390 
setting this aside we also have Apple's
new<00:03:19.690> ear<00:03:20.019> pod<00:03:20.290> headphone<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.010> let's<00:03:21.159> go<00:03:21.310> ahead

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
new ear pod headphone so let's go ahead

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.289 
new ear pod headphone so let's go ahead
and<00:03:21.519> take<00:03:21.909> these<00:03:22.150> out<00:03:22.359> as<00:03:22.569> well<00:03:24.120> similar<00:03:25.120> to

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
and take these out as well similar to

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.119 
and take these out as well similar to
the<00:03:25.449> ear<00:03:25.569> pod<00:03:25.780> headphones<00:03:26.229> that<00:03:26.439> ship<00:03:26.799> with

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
the ear pod headphones that ship with

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.250 
the ear pod headphones that ship with
the<00:03:27.310> iPod<00:03:27.819> Touch<00:03:28.120> they<00:03:28.569> do<00:03:28.629> not<00:03:28.959> have<00:03:29.109> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
the iPod Touch they do not have the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.500 
the iPod Touch they do not have the
remote<00:03:29.500> or<00:03:29.530> volume<00:03:30.069> controls<00:03:30.489> on<00:03:30.639> here<00:03:31.329> and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
remote or volume controls on here and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.000 
remote or volume controls on here and
obviously<00:03:31.930> they<00:03:32.349> don't<00:03:32.439> have<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> microphone

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
obviously they don't have a microphone

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.800 
obviously they don't have a microphone
either<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.879> unfortunately<00:03:34.389> these<00:03:34.510> aren't

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
either so unfortunately these aren't

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.509 
either so unfortunately these aren't
like<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.169> ear<00:03:35.319> pod<00:03:35.560> headphones<00:03:35.979> that<00:03:36.220> ship

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
like the ear pod headphones that ship

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.119 
like the ear pod headphones that ship
with<00:03:36.699> the<00:03:36.849> iPhone<00:03:37.359> 5<00:03:37.659> they<00:03:38.109> are<00:03:38.139> lower<00:03:38.829> quality

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
with the iPhone 5 they are lower quality

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.550 
with the iPhone 5 they are lower quality
however<00:03:39.669> they<00:03:40.299> still<00:03:40.359> provide<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.019> same

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
however they still provide the same

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.409 
however they still provide the same
sound<00:03:42.069> quality<00:03:42.639> even<00:03:43.090> though<00:03:43.150> they<00:03:43.269> don't

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
sound quality even though they don't

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.969 
sound quality even though they don't
have<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.689> microphone<00:03:44.199> and<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.680> volume

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
have the microphone and the volume

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.770 
have the microphone and the volume
controls<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.579> them<00:03:45.759> so<00:03:46.180> let's<00:03:46.329> go<00:03:46.449> ahead<00:03:46.569> and

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
controls on them so let's go ahead and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.140 
controls on them so let's go ahead and

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
I said you can watch videos however this

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.719
