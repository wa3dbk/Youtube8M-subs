even with all the heat damage chemical

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
even with all the heat damage chemical
over<00:00:50.460> processing<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> straightening<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

their hair every single day but they

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979 
their hair every single day but they
definitely<00:00:56.129> usually<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.180> they're<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.660> coming

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
definitely usually if they're not coming

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.360 
definitely usually if they're not coming
for<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> hair<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.070> hard<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
for the hair it will be very hard for

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
for the hair it will be very hard for
them<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> pass<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.180> shoulder<00:01:00.629> length<00:01:00.840> hump

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
them to pass that shoulder length hump

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.479 
them to pass that shoulder length hump
and<00:01:01.940> here's<00:01:02.940> why<00:01:03.619> one<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:05.189> ends<00:01:05.430> are

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and here's why one is your ends are

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
and here's why one is your ends are
probably<00:01:05.760> very<00:01:05.820> weak<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.420> brittle<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.470> when

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
probably very weak and brittle so when

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
probably very weak and brittle so when
it's<00:01:08.310> rubbing<00:01:08.820> against<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.360> clothes<00:01:09.810> it's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's rubbing against your clothes it's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010 
it's rubbing against your clothes it's
just<00:01:10.470> breaking<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.250> by<00:01:11.640> itself<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.810> for

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
just breaking off by itself but for

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.359 
just breaking off by itself but for
those<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.470> who<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> they're<00:01:14.189> you're
