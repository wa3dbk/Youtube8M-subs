the<00:03:49.170> difference<00:03:49.820> not<00:03:50.820> getting<00:03:51.060> into<00:03:51.240> that

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
the difference not getting into that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.100 
the difference not getting into that
okay<00:03:51.930> anyways<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:53.070> nice<00:03:53.250> nice<00:03:53.880> open<00:03:54.270> it's<00:03:54.660> got

okay anyways so nice nice open it's got
the<00:03:55.230> little<00:03:55.320> hole<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:57.650> blade<00:03:58.650> which<00:03:59.640> other

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
the little hole in the blade which other

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.810 
the little hole in the blade which other
than<00:04:00.660> doing<00:04:01.140> inappropriate<00:04:01.500> things<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:02.459> and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
than doing inappropriate things with and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.280 
than doing inappropriate things with and
having<00:04:03.030> subliminal<00:04:03.660> messages<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.170> people

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
having subliminal messages to people

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.360 
having subliminal messages to people
because<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:06.470> that's<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.620> pretty<00:04:08.070> big

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
because you know that's a pretty big

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.940 
because you know that's a pretty big
subliminal<00:04:08.940> message<00:04:09.270> um<00:04:11.300> I'm<00:04:12.300> pretty<00:04:12.360> sure<00:04:12.950> to

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
subliminal message um I'm pretty sure to

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.949 
subliminal message um I'm pretty sure to
hold<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.280> dees<00:04:15.140> or<00:04:16.140> something<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.980> not

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
hold that I dees or something if not

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.720 
hold that I dees or something if not
then<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.109> probably<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.500> give<00:04:19.680> them<00:04:19.830> lit<00:04:20.010> also

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
then it's probably to give them lit also

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.490 
then it's probably to give them lit also
give<00:04:20.910> makes<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.239> blade<00:04:21.390> lighter<00:04:21.690> because

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
give makes the blade lighter because

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.250 
give makes the blade lighter because
it's<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.830> big<00:04:23.010> chunk<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.430> steel<00:04:23.669> gone

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
it's a big chunk of the steel gone

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.320 
it's a big chunk of the steel gone
but<00:04:25.710> I'm<00:04:25.830> kind<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.160> worried<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.120> that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
but I'm kind of worried like that that

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.820 
but I'm kind of worried like that that
might<00:04:27.510> snap<00:04:28.080> if<00:04:28.470> enough<00:04:28.950> pressure<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.700> applied

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
might snap if enough pressure is applied

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.310 
might snap if enough pressure is applied
anyways<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.820> I'm<00:04:33.510> pretty<00:04:33.690> sure<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.050> more

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
anyways but I'm pretty sure this is more

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.590 
anyways but I'm pretty sure this is more
of<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.470> stabbing<00:04:34.920> knife<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.820> what<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.270> do

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
of a stabbing knife so what you can do

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.210 
of a stabbing knife so what you can do
is<00:04:37.760> stick<00:04:38.760> your<00:04:38.940> finger<00:04:39.770> that's<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.860> little<00:04:40.950> too

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
is stick your finger that's a little too

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.970 
is stick your finger that's a little too
forward<00:04:41.400> stick<00:04:41.970> your<00:04:42.000> finger<00:04:42.420> through<00:04:42.450> there

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
forward stick your finger through there

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.430 
forward stick your finger through there
and<00:04:43.980> then<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:44.460> makes<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:44.940> easier<00:04:45.120> to

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.230 

somebody's<00:04:49.440> got<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:51.030> get<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.300> point<00:04:51.510> okay<00:04:52.290> um

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
somebody's got you get the point okay um

off center camera but yeah anyways so

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.200 
off center camera but yeah anyways so
yeah<00:06:09.570> um<00:06:09.900> I<00:06:11.570> oh<00:06:13.340> that's<00:06:14.340> my<00:06:14.520> only<00:06:14.670> problem<00:06:14.970> with

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
yeah um I oh that's my only problem with

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.530 
yeah um I oh that's my only problem with
this<00:06:15.300> if<00:06:15.540> you<00:06:15.660> don't<00:06:16.940> push<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:17.970> hard<00:06:18.420> enough

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
this if you don't push it hard enough

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.490 
this if you don't push it hard enough
the<00:06:19.940> spring<00:06:20.940> doesn't<00:06:21.510> like<00:06:23.690> work<00:06:24.690> as<00:06:24.930> well<00:06:25.170> I

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
the spring doesn't like work as well I

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.150 
the spring doesn't like work as well I
guess<00:06:26.040> so<00:06:26.850> like<00:06:27.030> if<00:06:27.210> you<00:06:27.330> push<00:06:27.510> it<00:06:30.950> all<00:06:31.950> that

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
guess so like if you push it all that

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.620 
guess so like if you push it all that
probably<00:06:32.490> didn't<00:06:32.760> demonstrate<00:06:32.850> it<00:06:33.270> very<00:06:33.450> well

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
probably didn't demonstrate it very well

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.820 
probably didn't demonstrate it very well
but

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.680 

that's<00:06:37.830> it<00:06:37.949> I<00:06:38.130> did<00:06:38.550> it<00:06:38.669> two<00:06:38.820> seconds<00:06:39.150> ago<00:06:39.270> okay

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
that's it I did it two seconds ago okay

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.629 
that's it I did it two seconds ago okay
it's<00:06:40.590> not<00:06:40.680> going<00:06:40.830> to<00:06:40.949> go<00:06:41.040> when<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:41.220> opened<00:06:41.580> it

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
it's not going to go when I opened it

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.969 
it's not going to go when I opened it
and<00:06:41.790> it<00:06:41.880> didn't<00:06:42.150> fully<00:06:42.330> click<00:06:42.720> if<00:06:43.590> you<00:06:43.800> don't

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
and it didn't fully click if you don't

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.700 
and it didn't fully click if you don't
push<00:06:44.190> it<00:06:44.220> hard<00:06:44.520> enough<00:06:44.610> it<00:06:44.910> won't<00:06:45.120> but<00:06:45.960> so<00:06:46.440> if

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
push it hard enough it won't but so if

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.840 
push it hard enough it won't but so if
you<00:06:46.830> push<00:06:47.100> it<00:06:47.310> like<00:06:49.070> see<00:06:50.070> the<00:06:50.310> harder<00:06:50.550> you<00:06:50.639> push

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.850 
you push it like see the harder you push

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.610 
you push it like see the harder you push
it<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.389> faster<00:06:51.750> it'll<00:06:51.900> come<00:06:52.080> out<00:06:52.199> which<00:06:52.470> I

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
it the faster it'll come out which I

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.310 
it the faster it'll come out which I
don't<00:06:52.830> understand<00:06:53.780> because<00:06:54.780> most<00:06:55.080> of<00:06:55.169> my

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
don't understand because most of my

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.719 
don't understand because most of my
