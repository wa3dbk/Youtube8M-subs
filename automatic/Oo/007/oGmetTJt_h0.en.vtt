before with a camera so I'll have a look

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290 
before with a camera so I'll have a look
at<00:02:06.869> those<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> full<00:02:07.710> review<00:02:08.300> then

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
at those when I do the full review then

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880 
at those when I do the full review then
we've<00:02:09.450> got<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> battery<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.619> section

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
we've got the battery in this section

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.809 
we've got the battery in this section
here

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
here

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
here
let's<00:02:12.269> have<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> look<00:02:12.659> see<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.049> type<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
let's have a look see what type of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.500 
let's have a look see what type of
battery<00:02:13.799> we've<00:02:13.950> got<00:02:14.329> so<00:02:15.329> we<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:16.019> an<00:02:16.400> NP

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
battery we've got so we have got an NP

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.459 
battery we've got so we have got an NP
bx1<00:02:18.680> 3.6<00:02:19.680> volt<00:02:19.950> 4.5<00:02:20.670> watt<00:02:20.909> our<00:02:21.090> 12<00:02:21.959> hundred<00:02:22.349> and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
bx1 3.6 volt 4.5 watt our 12 hundred and

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.949 
bx1 3.6 volt 4.5 watt our 12 hundred and
40<00:02:22.890> milli<00:02:23.250> amp<00:02:23.430> hour<00:02:23.700> battery<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.689> one<00:02:24.870> of

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
40 milli amp hour battery is one of

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.830 
40 milli amp hour battery is one of
their<00:02:25.079> X<00:02:25.290> type<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.799> batteries<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.540> put<00:02:27.689> that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
their X type of batteries so we put that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.380 
their X type of batteries so we put that
to<00:02:27.959> one<00:02:28.049> side<00:02:28.109> we're<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.739> need<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.129> and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
to one side we're going to need that and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.449 
to one side we're going to need that and
then<00:02:30.390> last<00:02:30.629> but<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.870> least<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.620> got<00:02:32.159> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
then last but not least we have got a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.809 
then last but not least we have got a
little<00:02:33.120> sort<00:02:33.659> of<00:02:33.689> charging<00:02:34.290> unit<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.459> is

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
little sort of charging unit so this is

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.170 
little sort of charging unit so this is
a<00:02:36.060> multi<00:02:36.810> voltage<00:02:37.170> charger<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.430> power<00:02:38.790> cable

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
a multi voltage charger the power cable

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.569 
a multi voltage charger the power cable
goes<00:02:39.299> in<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.629> end<00:02:39.840> USB<00:02:40.739> cable<00:02:41.129> goes<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
goes in this end USB cable goes in this

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.119 
goes in this end USB cable goes in this
end<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.389> camera<00:02:42.810> actually<00:02:43.200> charges<00:02:43.769> via

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
end and the camera actually charges via

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.879 
end and the camera actually charges via
USB<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:45.629> let's<00:02:45.840> take<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.049> closer<00:02:46.349> look<00:02:46.620> at

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
USB so now let's take a closer look at

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.210 
USB so now let's take a closer look at
the<00:02:47.250> rx100<00:02:48.049> okay<00:02:49.049> so<00:02:49.109> let's<00:02:49.560> start<00:02:49.829> by<00:02:50.040> taking

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the rx100 okay so let's start by taking

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.309

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
little cover here let's just see if we

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.430 
little cover here let's just see if we
can<00:03:33.780> open<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.229> up<00:03:35.720> there<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.900> go<00:03:37.049> it's<00:03:37.260> quite

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
can open this up there we go it's quite

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.159 
can open this up there we go it's quite
a<00:03:37.470> tight<00:03:37.739> fit<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.220> under<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.239> resides<00:03:39.959> that

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
a tight fit and under here resides that

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.280 
a tight fit and under here resides that
micro<00:03:40.859> USB<00:03:41.370> socket<00:03:41.819> let's<00:03:42.690> put<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.049> back

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
micro USB socket let's put that back

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.860 
micro USB socket let's put that back
into<00:03:43.500> place<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.370> nice<00:03:44.549> Clippy<00:03:45.150> sort<00:03:45.810> of

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
into place it's a nice Clippy sort of

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.270 
into place it's a nice Clippy sort of
design<00:03:46.229> that<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.769> not<00:03:46.859> going<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.099> fall

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
design that so it's not going to fall

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.129 
design that so it's not going to fall
out<00:03:47.310> easily<00:03:47.699> and<00:03:48.060> then<00:03:48.599> we<00:03:48.750> take<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.989> look

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
out easily and then we take a look

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.080 
out easily and then we take a look
around<00:03:49.260> on<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.590> side<00:03:49.650> completely<00:03:50.519> clear<00:03:50.909> on
