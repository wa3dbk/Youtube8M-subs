00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.940
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.010
 nightmare ' and welcome to this new 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.630
 Many videos ask me what addons 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.790
 occupied within the game so that 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.170
 I decided to make a video about it in 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.939
 where I give a brief explanation about 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.310
 each of the addons that I have and 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.960
 which I recommend the addons are very 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.240
 easy to set up and it will only take them 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.949
 they can find the names a little time 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.439
 of the addons that I will mention here 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.640
 in the description of the video as they 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.439
 I say it will only be a brief 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.989
 explanation since I'm going to mention 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.550
 several addons within this video and give 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.960
 a detailed explanation about each one 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.460
 of these mice would take me a lot 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.170
 time then as I tell you only 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.300
 it's in a brief explanation I do not know 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.860
 despair is easy to set when 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.510
 of these advance if it will not take them much 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.330
 then let's start with what is 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.549
 this video one of the addons that many 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.320
 they ask me is the mid display that is 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.570
 where my health bar is displayed 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.879
 image of my character and so on 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.140
 this addon is called expert and to take 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.110
 the settings you must write 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 diagonal ex but here it modifies the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.560
 appearance that you want your 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.350
 display and you can modify the different 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.439
 options for you your goal your focus 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.120
 a part or a network do not get scared I know that 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.520
 many options appear but 90 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.960
 percent of them are not modified by 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.580
 the regular only modify a few 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.650
 How many options to choose if you want 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.080
 that your image is on three of the scale 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.300
 of your display or the scale of the boxes and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.820
 of the types you have or your goal 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.530
 and to move your display or any other 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.350
 of the displays either of your character 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.270
 of your goal of your focus or of your 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.560
 pet where you have to drag to 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.600
 any part of the game where the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.660
 you want to place for this remember 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.580
 have the settings menu open 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.620
 the next addon schwartz in del 4 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.020
 to bring the options menu only 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.790
 you write diagonal bartender esteban 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.830
 Modify your action bars and you 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.110
 will allow to place them and any part 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.850
 you want is an add-on very useful as it 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.650
 remove some aspects that take away the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 visibility and it only leaves you with the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.530
 bars that is the essential thing and it's going to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.380
 help to have the widest visibility 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.000
 within the game you can modify your 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.010
 different options such as the scale of 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
 bars that are separate you want that 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.119
 be if you want them to be invisible 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.830
 etcetera versus different options and 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.990
 understand them will not take more than 5 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.190
 minutes and so it's very easy to modify 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.680
 this to gift and to understand him 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.860
 of tulle and post mod is a very useful light 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 for pvp and for tv for tve when you 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940
 you face a boss, you get an accountant 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.220
 how much time it takes for me to launch a 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.220
 attack and warnings appear on 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.290
 what is going on in the battle for 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.970
 pvp serves you on battlefields in 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.320
 where he throws you in different counters 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.720
 depending on the battlefield that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.190
 you're doing for example if you're 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.140
 being free and catch somewhere 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.580
 you get an accountant on how much 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
 time is missing for me to capture that 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.090
 place completely and how long 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.070
 missing for you to win a game 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.500
 depending on the amount of bases that 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.030
 you have captured this addon is 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.560
 really useful and I think any 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.570
 decent player should have 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.980
 this to gift and the best thing is that neat not 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.130
 requires that you modify it is nothing 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.460
 you just install it and it's ready 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.190
 automatically 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.650
 the next add-on is a great pulse 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.940
 what it does is show the time in the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.100
 that you can reuse your 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.570
 spells after having occupied them in 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.970
 yes it does not require to be modified by anything 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.640
 but you can do it by typing diagonal 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.160
 of s &amp; p and that reveres the options for 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.530
 Modify 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.580
 the healthy ones for pepe that I recommend the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.320
 gladiator sy and gladioli currently 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780
 the grade is not useful in this patch 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.330
 but it's really useful and it only requires 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.180
 install you will not have to modify anything 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.950
 the gladiator the s well works in this 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.900
 patch and its function is to name the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.060
 spells your opponent throws at the time 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.860
 of the battle to launch the menu of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.440
 options you only write diagonal the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.780
 director who knows who if you do not have to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.160
 modify anything to this addon but you can 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.780
 indicate where you want to 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.450
 work in arenas on battlefields 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.220
 or anywhere in the game and also 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.470
 they can tell you that they want 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.940
 I mentioned but if the only thing I recommend 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.740
 that modifies that is the place for 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.110
 only serve in sands and fields of 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.390
 battle 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.250
 it's a really useful add-on and only 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.680
 with voice commands you will be able to know 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.200
 what guys is throwing your opponent to the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.500
 time of the battle would be like 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.959
 a hearing aid now we have omni 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.519
 cc is once it shows you how much 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.100
 you will be under the influence of some 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.290
 cease either firm stone or any other 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.610
 it's very useful and you do not have to modify it 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.370
 nothing 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.229
 our next addon is quartz is a 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.789
 where it shows a bar where it will load 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.500
 some spell or something similar 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.210
 for example when you are invoking 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.430
 some mount another stone heart are 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.740
 to go back somewhere or as I said 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.900
 previously when this wear on 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.659
 some spell will show a bar that 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.389
 will show you the advance of this spell to 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.800
 be castrating him to modify his 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.900
 options only you write diagonal 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.060
 quartz and the menu will appear 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.740
 options if you want to move it from place 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.719
 the bars you just have to remove 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.969
 the mark of the popcorn where the 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.590
 logo and drag the bars to any 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.639
 part of the screen where you want 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.710
 that are 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.900
 and count is an add-on very useful as it 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.699
 shows different types of information and 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.789
 asia the damage you do the damage received 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.379
 healing and so on can you tell 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.659
 who want to send the information 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.340
 that has been obtained and see the different 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.110
 options to modify as what it is 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.199
 the information you want me to collect 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.060
 its appearance and so on there are several 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.710
 options that you can modify and to 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.539
 delete the information obtained only 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.590
 click on the sign that has the 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.810
 red x 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.550
 6 and map only changes the appearance 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.990
 of the minimap and to modify its 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.160
 appearance only you write diagonal 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.600
 sexy map 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.460
 and here explore the different options 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.420
 for example on edges you can change your 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.610
 Appearance and its color 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.830
 tahiti plate shows you the bars on 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.440
 the name or about your enemies is very 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.870
 useful for pvp and for pv since also 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.250
 they show you the drawings they have for 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.260
 modify your options only 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.480
 you type diagonal style and plate and you can 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.400
 Modify your appearance you can choose 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.810
 what appearance do you want me to have 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.450
 battle time if you're going to do it 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.220
 feet or if you are going to make a tank this 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.110
 as I say it will work for pp and 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.190
 for pepe that's why he has the option is 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.190
 type of tank 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.840
 iuris run display this ado not only 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.150
 is for those of cas and shows the runes 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.980
 that you have inside the game and you can 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.470
 modify their size and place them in 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.600
 any part of the screen to see 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.390
 your only options is pressure is 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.910
 on your keyboard you will interfere in the 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.830
 part of addons and you go to iuris round this 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.770
 way 'and modify the different options 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.360
 that show you next in if they are 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.880
 very basic and I only recommend that you 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.130
 make the changes if you want to do it more 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.770
 large or smaller depending on your 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.110
 taste and change the place from where 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.670
 They want to be placed these runes and 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.610
 well it does not require many changes that 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.030
 you make this atom last we have 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.080
 next a call to don control panel 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.270
 This gift is useful because it allows you 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.430
 keep track of your addons from the 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.900
 game and you can activate or deactivate the 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.880
 without having to go out to the main menu 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.190
 it's an add-on that I highly recommend 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.560
 as I tell you to keep track one 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.169
 better control within the game about you 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.400
 lounge is clearly good these are 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.320
 all the years that I have and that 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.030
 I recommend that if they are very easy to
