these things
I<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.710> have

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I don't think actually they they have

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
I don't think actually they they have
multiplayer<00:00:57.350> no<00:00:58.350> doesn't<00:00:58.800> seem<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.070> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
multiplayer no doesn't seem like they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.869 
multiplayer no doesn't seem like they
have<00:00:59.280> multiplayer<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.460> pretty

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have multiplayer that would be pretty

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.750 
have multiplayer that would be pretty
freakin<00:01:03.359> awesome<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.809> had<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.519> yeah<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
freakin awesome if they had but yeah of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.810 
freakin awesome if they had but yeah of
course<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:06.630> add<00:01:06.900> multiplier<00:01:07.820> that's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
course they can't add multiplier that's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
course they can't add multiplier that's
overkill

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
