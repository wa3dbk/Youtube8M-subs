00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.799
 I'll show you an exercise now 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.070
 weightlifter area this exercise is called 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.230
 Turnover is a part of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.410
 olympic exercise and push it one 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 substantial basis around accordingly 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 relatively high loads from the ground into the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.449
 chest height to move and fix 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 When moving the dumbbell from the ground 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.590
 an explosive movement by stretch 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.810
 of knee and hip joints in the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.300
 position in front of the chest brought the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 body is lowered while the deep 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.770
 means I go into a deep squat and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.450
 then stand as the knee bend from from 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.090
 it is good to do the exercise 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 necessary the squat form with 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 appropriate attitude of the barbell 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 that means grip with elbows 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 pushed ahead and then dominate 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.270
 I am also able to implement 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.070
 to perform effectively 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 in this first variant I show you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.719
 now the execution from the elevated 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.719
 position and translated into the stand 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.750
 Now I show the execution of the floor 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.750
 in the squat 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.760
 when implementing it comes as with all 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.650
 Free trade exercises on the technique 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.360
 to execute exactly and cleanly 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.910
 that means for one thing 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 stabilized straight spine that 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.080
 The head looks straight ahead 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.780
 is held around the spine active 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.480
 stable position 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.060
 Furthermore , it is important in 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.740
 speed up the trade the barbell 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.510
 relatively tight and close to the body too 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.120
 keep the power in one 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.310
 unfolded in the right direction of movement 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.260
 can be 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.940
 The practice is not only in the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.240
 weightlifting widespread in force 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.330
 oriented functional training and im 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.890
 Head is fit to find this exercise 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 when weightlifting is to be noted that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.490
 the repetition numbers if the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.160
 movement should be performed exactly 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.770
 at a maximum of three to five repetitions 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.720
 That's important because if I am 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.520
 must work technically clean 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.470
 be very focused 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.420
 nervous system must be recovered and 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.090
 therefore , fatigue in the exercise 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.070
 not advisable I work with low 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.019
 loads in endurance or power 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.739
 Hypertrophy area would be too 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.540
 conceivable 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.480
 such an exercise with higher 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.050
 repeat numbers 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.050
 have fun while practicing
