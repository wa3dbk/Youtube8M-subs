00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
have the main spawn building this is

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.500 
have the main spawn building this is
where<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.400> find<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> tramplesteam

where you can find the tramplesteam

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.479 
where you can find the tramplesteam
you<00:03:07.020> then<00:03:07.200> have<00:03:07.410> below<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.860> spawn<00:03:08.130> building

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489

in<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.640> sweatshop<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.510> where<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.930> find

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
in the sweatshop this is where you find

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040 
in the sweatshop this is where you find
the<00:03:11.070> silica<00:03:11.430> fire<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.630> upside

down building where there is no
buildable<00:03:15.480> why<00:03:16.140> don't<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.410> throw<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
buildable why don't we throw in the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.890 
buildable why don't we throw in the
zombie<00:03:16.950> shield<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> map<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.420> does

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
zombie shield for a map that does

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.840 
zombie shield for a map that does
encourage<00:03:19.350> camping<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:19.980> some<00:03:20.190> aspects<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
encourage camping in some aspects I

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.130 
encourage camping in some aspects I
think<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> zombie<00:03:21.390> shield<00:03:21.600> would<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.900> quite

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
think a zombie shield would be quite

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.570 
think a zombie shield would be quite
nice<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.830> we<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.130> plenty<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.430> cool

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
nice to have we have plenty of cool

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.390 
nice to have we have plenty of cool
camping<00:03:23.790> spots<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.630> escalators<00:03:25.470> or<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
camping spots like the escalators or the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.509 
camping spots like the escalators or the
back<00:03:26.670> area<00:03:27.180> located<00:03:27.750> by<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.380> dragon<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.430> I

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
back area located by the dragon and I

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.250 
back area located by the dragon and I
think<00:03:29.730> either<00:03:29.970> spot<00:03:30.330> would<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.570> fun<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.019> camp

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
think either spot would be fun to camp

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.259 
think either spot would be fun to camp
