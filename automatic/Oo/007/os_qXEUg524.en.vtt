00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
this video I'm going to show you how to

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.660 
this video I'm going to show you how to
use<00:00:15.139> 3d<00:00:15.620> models<00:00:16.279> like<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:17.360> one<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:18.670> import

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
use 3d models like this one and import

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.740 
use 3d models like this one and import
them<00:00:19.880> into<00:00:20.619> Minecraft<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:22.550> can<00:00:22.910> basically

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
them into Minecraft so you can basically

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.420 
them into Minecraft so you can basically
have<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.200> 3d<00:00:24.529> model<00:00:24.860> that<00:00:25.009> you<00:00:25.099> can<00:00:25.220> download

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
have a 3d model that you can download

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.780 
have a 3d model that you can download
off<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.759> internet<00:00:26.380> which<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.890> got<00:00:28.189> this<00:00:28.400> model

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
off the internet which I got this model

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.420

website I'm going to download the STL

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.569 
website I'm going to download the STL
and<00:00:50.440> for<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:51.589> program<00:00:51.980> we're<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.339> use

and for this program we're going to use

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.430 
and for this program we're going to use
we<00:00:52.969> are<00:00:53.179> going<00:00:53.359> to<00:00:53.420> use<00:00:54.280> program<00:00:55.280> called<00:00:56.440> obj

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
we are going to use program called obj

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.079 
we are going to use program called obj
to<00:00:57.499> MC<00:00:58.309> which<00:00:59.140> the<00:01:00.140> website<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.370> originally

to MC which the website that originally

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.509 
to MC which the website that originally
made<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:02.600> program<00:01:02.929> doesn't<00:01:03.769> exist<00:01:04.220> anymore

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
made this program doesn't exist anymore

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.090 
made this program doesn't exist anymore
so<00:01:04.909> I'm<00:01:05.030> going<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.239> re-upload<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.100> full

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
so I'm going to re-upload it and full

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.680 
so I'm going to re-upload it and full
props<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.670> them<00:01:07.820> for<00:01:08.150> making<00:01:08.420> this<00:01:08.510> awesome

props to them for making this awesome

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.320 
props to them for making this awesome
program<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:12.050> uses<00:01:12.409> obj<00:01:13.159> files<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.940> you're

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
program and it uses obj files so you're

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.679 
program and it uses obj files so you're
going<00:01:14.480> to<00:01:14.540> have<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.720> download<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.380> STL<00:01:15.920> and

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
going to have to download the STL and

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.940 
going to have to download the STL and
then<00:01:17.689> probably<00:01:18.020> go<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.439> different<00:01:18.799> website

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
then probably go to a different website

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.010 
then probably go to a different website
and<00:01:19.340> convert<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.820> there's<00:01:20.210> whole<00:01:20.689> bunch<00:01:20.899> of

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
and convert it there's whole bunch of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.929 
and convert it there's whole bunch of
conversion<00:01:21.979> websites<00:01:22.430> I'm<00:01:22.579> not<00:01:22.729> going<00:01:22.880> to

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
conversion websites I'm not going to

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.520 
conversion websites I'm not going to
show<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.119> how<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.210> do<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.570> or<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:24.200> can<00:01:24.320> just

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
show you how to do that or we can just

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.590 
show you how to do that or we can just
download<00:01:24.649> an<00:01:25.009> obj<00:01:27.009> so<00:01:28.060> once<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.270> have<00:01:29.390> your

download an obj so once you have your

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.209 
download an obj so once you have your
model<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.170> I'm<00:01:30.290> going<00:01:30.469> to<00:01:30.500> upload<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.040> one

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
model and I'm going to upload this one

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.649 
model and I'm going to upload this one
too<00:01:31.399> just<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.939> don't<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.299> convert

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
too just so you don't have to convert

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.929 
too just so you don't have to convert
anything<00:01:33.130> we're<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.369> start<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
anything we're going to start the

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.550 
anything we're going to start the
program<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:37.899> we're<00:01:38.899> going<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.049> browse<00:01:39.290> for

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
program and we're going to browse for

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.039 
program and we're going to browse for
our<00:01:39.680> file<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.399> have<00:01:40.549> to<00:01:40.640> change<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.299> obj

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
our file you have to change it to obj

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.289 
our file you have to change it to obj
these<00:01:42.380> are<00:01:42.560> all<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.770> files<00:01:42.979> say<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:44.180> it

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
these are all the files say that it

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.410 
these are all the files say that it
accepts<00:01:44.719> what<00:01:45.079> obj<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.560> pretty<00:01:45.920> common<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.270> I'm

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
accepts what obj is pretty common so I'm

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.800 
accepts what obj is pretty common so I'm
going<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.659> go<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.810> my<00:01:48.020> file<00:01:48.289> click<00:01:48.890> open<00:01:49.100> and

let's<00:02:01.640> go<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.909> block<00:02:02.240> ID<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:02.869> want<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.560> be

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
let's go to a block ID I want it to be

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
let's go to a block ID I want it to be
iron

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:17.830 

oh<00:02:08.149> yes<00:02:11.150> let's<00:02:12.150> find<00:02:12.540> out<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.900> iron<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.380> iron

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.080 

is<00:02:22.580> 4242<00:02:23.610> yeah<00:02:24.470> okay<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.820> we're<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
is 4242 yeah okay so we're going to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
is 4242 yeah okay so we're going to
change<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.570> 42<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:30.140> we're<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.350> click

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
change it to 42 and we're going to click

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.010 
change it to 42 and we're going to click
convert<00:02:31.920> now<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.790> take<00:02:33.030> quite<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> while

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
convert now this can take quite a while

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.460 
convert now this can take quite a while
depending<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.940> what<00:02:35.940> your<00:02:36.150> computer<00:02:36.630> specs

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
depending on what your computer specs

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.680 
depending on what your computer specs
are<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.130> I'm<00:02:38.490> probably<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.270> pause<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
are so I'm probably going to pause it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.270 
are so I'm probably going to pause it
and<00:02:39.840> I'll<00:02:40.650> show<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.070> it's<00:02:41.220> done

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and I'll show you when it's done

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420 
and I'll show you when it's done
converting<00:02:42.560> okay<00:02:43.560> well<00:02:43.739> that's<00:02:43.920> converting

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
converting okay well that's converting

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.010 
converting okay well that's converting
I'm<00:02:44.550> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:44.880> into<00:02:45.090> minecraft<00:02:47.810> which<00:02:48.810> is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
I'm going to go into minecraft which is

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
I'm going to go into minecraft which is
probably<00:02:49.230> going<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.440> take<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> while<00:02:49.860> because

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
probably going to take a while because

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.729 
probably going to take a while because
it's<00:02:50.370> converting<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.030> 3d<00:02:51.930> model<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.470> I'm<00:02:52.590> going

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
it's converting a 3d model but I'm going

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.940 
it's converting a 3d model but I'm going
to<00:02:52.770> click<00:02:52.860> play<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:57.620> we're<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:58.709> going<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
to click play and we're just going to

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.440 
to click play and we're just going to
make<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> new<00:02:59.310> world<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.880> already<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.269> one

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
make a new world I already have one

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.380 
make a new world I already have one
called<00:03:00.690> Eiffel<00:03:01.050> Tower<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:01.880> we'll<00:03:02.880> make<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> new

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
called Eiffel Tower but we'll make a new

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.190 
called Eiffel Tower but we'll make a new
one<00:03:03.570> called<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:06.120> 3d<00:03:07.110> model<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.989> just<00:03:09.989> be

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
one called a 3d model and just be

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.300 
one called a 3d model and just be
creative<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:14.250> flat<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.590> being<00:03:16.590> a

creative do flat just for being a
demonstration<00:03:18.030> video<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.670> then<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.790> have<00:03:20.910> our

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
demonstration video and then we have our

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.590 
demonstration video and then we have our
world<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.709> I'm<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.670> save<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.540> quit

importing<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.350> model<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:28.980> do<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.190> one<00:03:29.400> of

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
importing the model you can do it one of

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.250 
importing the model you can do it one of
two<00:03:29.579> ways<00:03:29.730> if<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.269> have<00:03:30.450> worldedit

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
two ways if you have worldedit

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.069 
two ways if you have worldedit
on<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> server<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.910> import<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.540> schematic

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
on a server you can import the schematic

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.020 
on a server you can import the schematic
that<00:03:34.290> way<00:03:35.040> I'm<00:03:35.310> not<00:03:35.489> going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.700> show<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.940> how
