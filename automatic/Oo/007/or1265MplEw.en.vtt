00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.880
 well in this lesson we are going to learn to 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.730
 fade the edges ok of the loops 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.000
 that are together simply so that 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.150
 you know how to do it actually and what 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.830
 staff I think the edges that have been 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.960
 marked that have been defined in this 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.150
 part in the lateral part and in the part 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.400
 below they give view to our model 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.680
 that will be for your consideration if you want 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.040
 let him remove it personally I think that 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.840
 they give more view to our model but 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.690
 if you need to know how to remove them if 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.970
 is if they are not to your liking we are going to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.180
 do with these edges you realize that 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.730
 right here they reach to mark a 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 small edge and right here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.750
 let's select the model press 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.640
 the number 1 you realize that it's fair 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.980
 for the same because we have many looks 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.970
 very close then this makes it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.160
 define the forms 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.540
 well for this we are going to go to mode 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.409
 done edge mode let's select the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.990
 first two edges 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.329
 once selected we will go to the menu 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130
 edit month and we will occupy another of the 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.579
 powerful tools that he offers us 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.890
 maya is light edge tool and we are going to 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.619
 add self control shift and click 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.899
 left or primary mouse is what 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.909
 same we are going to click on our 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.130
 tool and with the mouse wheel 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.599
 pressed as if it were a button without 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.280
 let's go let's go and you give 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:43.020
 realize that this is what helps us 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.329
 travel the loop or the light segment to 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.270
 along the surface without altering the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.399
 ok way, this is going to happen to the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.159
 center you realize that approximately 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.750
 in the Maya center automatically 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.429
 adhered so that the left in the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 center and ready 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.039
 ok let's go to object mode we take the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.840
 move tool we select our 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.090
 dirigible we press the number 3 and as 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.640
 you realize it looks a lot less 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.250
 it is still noticing 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.650
 so much is still marked a little what 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.930
 that would be our edge because we have 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.170
 still two loops nearby but already each 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.940
 less time if you compare what is marked 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
 here with what is marked is that you give 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.890
 account that is already framed much less like this 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.150
 is that to finish vanishing what 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.940
 we go to mode done again 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.540
 we select these two loops activate 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.489
 our slide club tool with the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.900
 mouse wheel pressed as if 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.270
 was a button without releasing it what 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.770
 ok we walk right downtown 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.230
 we activate the move tool 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.230
 we press the number 3 we go to mode 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 object and ready you realize that we have 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.400
 completely vanished the edge that was 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.420
 marked without losing and without stopping 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.930
 without losing the definition of forgiveness of 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 the right way here is to say we have 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.799
 perfectly defined the form here 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.799
 up without being marked here and just like that 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.390
 we would do it for the top part to the 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.120
 part of here if you want to fade a 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.579
 little these marks the personal I repeat you 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.470
 I like it gives life to the model well 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.319
 is that I'm just going to fade 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.530
 these brands ok we can do so 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.920
 faster simply these 2 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.240
 we select these two also 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.340
 to make it faster 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.910
 we activate our tool 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.440
 and right at the center do it on both sides 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.440
 to make it faster 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.739
 these edges activate our 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.880
 tool provides the mouse pressed 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.740
 as if it were a button we went to the center 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.570
 we encrypt as lucerito das cuenta that 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.390
 we have completely vanished those 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.180
 ok marks 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.980
 and we have or we still have our 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.310
 perfectly defined forms in the 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.920
 top part 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.230
 let's do exactly even here 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.190
 it keeps marking a bit because from 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.570
 then 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.960
 here so we're going to do it 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.960
 quickly 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.300
 to the center 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.819
 the same with these two edges press 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.530
 the g key remembers to activate the 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.829
 last tool used in this 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.870
 case is a youtube slider 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.819
 and we have completely vanished 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.680
 the edges that had been marked at 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.169
 put the loops to keep the forms 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.490
 and we have also maintained the form in the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.469
 top can do 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.509
 exactly the same in the part of 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:37.719
 down and see you in our next 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:41.610
 election already fading these two 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.610
 edges at the bottom ok
