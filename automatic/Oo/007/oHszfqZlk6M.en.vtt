to<00:00:31.330> win<00:00:31.990> Rick<00:00:32.470> Lauren<00:00:32.800> certainly<00:00:33.220> has<00:00:33.430> the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
to win Rick Lauren certainly has the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.190 
to win Rick Lauren certainly has the
command<00:00:33.970> of<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.150> lanes<00:00:34.330> he's<00:00:34.510> been<00:00:34.660> up<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:35.050> on

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
command of the lanes he's been up in on

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.010 
command of the lanes he's been up in on
them<00:00:35.410> for<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.860> last<00:00:36.040> over<00:00:36.309> an<00:00:36.700> hour<00:00:36.900> but<00:00:37.900> he's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
them for the last over an hour but he's

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.600 
them for the last over an hour but he's
never<00:00:38.199> won<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.500> tournament<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.129> I<00:00:39.160> think<00:00:39.309> that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
never won a tournament so I think that

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.090 
never won a tournament so I think that
that<00:00:39.940> pressure<00:00:40.420> could<00:00:41.350> certainly<00:00:41.620> get<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:42.010> him

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
that pressure could certainly get to him

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.650 
that pressure could certainly get to him
but<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.430> still<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:43.000> still<00:00:43.239> like<00:00:43.600> him<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:43.870> win<00:00:48.660> no

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
but I still I still like him to win no

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.890 
but I still I still like him to win no
problem<00:00:50.230> with<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:50.530> seven<00:00:51.160> can<00:00:51.430> spare<00:00:52.030> it

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.299 

will<00:00:55.900> be<00:00:55.989> important<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:56.530> see<00:00:56.710> how<00:00:56.860> Parker

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309
