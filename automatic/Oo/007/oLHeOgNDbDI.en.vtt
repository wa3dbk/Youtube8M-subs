weapons<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.720> feel<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.740> when<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
weapons I feel like this is when the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
weapons I feel like this is when the
only<00:01:35.189> classes<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.450> shotguns<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
only classes are the only shotguns I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.749 
only classes are the only shotguns I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
primarily sticking to this one side of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.780 
primarily sticking to this one side of
the<00:02:03.960> map<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> map<00:02:05.340> seems<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the map because this I the map seems to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.119 
the map because this I the map seems to
like<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.689> able<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:07.469> able<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.799> control

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
like you be able you're able to control

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.160

the traffic and and control the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.800 
the traffic and and control the
engagement<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> say<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.610> better<00:02:11.940> because

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
engagement so to say much better because

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.510 
engagement so to say much better because
there's<00:02:13.349> only<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.680> few<00:02:13.950> ways<00:02:14.099> they're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.459> to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
there's only a few ways they're going to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.890 
there's only a few ways they're going to
be<00:02:14.580> coming<00:02:14.700> from<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.000> left<00:02:15.360> side<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
be coming from that left side and the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.240 
be coming from that left side and the
right<00:02:15.930> side<00:02:16.080> when<00:02:16.739> you're<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> other<00:02:17.069> side

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
right side when you're on the other side

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.320 
right side when you're on the other side
a<00:02:17.520> map<00:02:17.670> there's<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.060> many<00:02:18.209> different

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
a map there's so many different

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120 
a map there's so many different
different<00:02:18.959> buildings<00:02:19.290> they<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
different buildings they can go in and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.100 
different buildings they can go in and
out<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.310> indifferent<00:02:21.090> doorways<00:02:21.420> like<00:02:21.780> as<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
out of indifferent doorways like as you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.300 
out of indifferent doorways like as you
see<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.530> switching<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.980> other<00:02:23.069> side

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
see here I'm switching to the other side

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.830 
see here I'm switching to the other side
of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.489> map<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.760> I'm<00:02:23.849> rushing<00:02:24.120> around<00:02:24.209> just

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
of the map and I'm rushing around just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.809 
of the map and I'm rushing around just
because<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.260> had<00:02:25.380> already<00:02:25.530> gotten<00:02:25.890> my<00:02:26.069> lodestar

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
because I had already gotten my lodestar

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.130 
because I had already gotten my lodestar
which<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.180> was<00:02:27.239> aiming<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.020> after

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
which is what I was aiming for so after

which is what I was aiming for so after
I<00:02:28.290> got<00:02:28.410> all<00:02:28.560> my<00:02:28.650> killstreaks<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.489> really

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
I got all my killstreaks there really

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.550

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
was no point sticking to one side of the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800 
was no point sticking to one side of the
map<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:32.280> yeah<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.209> if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.660> guys

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
of the map that I was at it the entire

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.580 
of the map that I was at it the entire
time<00:02:42.030> during<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.599> map<00:02:42.810> yeah<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.470> guys

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
time during this map yeah if you guys

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.900 
time during this map yeah if you guys
didn't<00:02:43.860> notice<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.190> actually<00:02:44.340> joined<00:02:44.700> this

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
didn't notice I actually joined this

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.789 
didn't notice I actually joined this
game<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.690> literally<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.470> was<00:02:46.500> almost

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
game like literally it was almost

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.949 
game like literally it was almost
halfway<00:02:47.160> through<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:48.150> team<00:02:48.390> had<00:02:48.510> 45

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
halfway through I think my team had 45

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.050 
halfway through I think my team had 45
dog<00:02:49.230> tags<00:02:49.500> I'm<00:02:49.709> pretty<00:02:50.220> sure<00:02:50.340> he'll<00:02:50.760> confirm

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
dog tags I'm pretty sure he'll confirm

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.120 
dog tags I'm pretty sure he'll confirm
now<00:02:51.269> goes<00:02:51.510> up<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> hundred<00:02:51.930> dog<00:02:52.230> tags<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.100> I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
now goes up to a hundred dog tags so I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.590 
now goes up to a hundred dog tags so I
joined<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.610> pretty<00:02:53.819> much<00:02:53.940> half<00:02:54.120> way<00:02:54.299> through

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
joined a pretty much half way through

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.110 
joined a pretty much half way through
and<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.140> still<00:02:55.440> ended<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:55.830> killing<00:02:56.040> 22<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.970> one

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and I still ended up killing 22 and one

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.850 
and I still ended up killing 22 and one
in<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.330> game<00:02:57.540> play<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.410> death<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.830> a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
in this game play and the one death of a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.130 
in this game play and the one death of a
very<00:02:59.160> very<00:02:59.489> suspect<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.630> I'd<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:00.930> been<00:03:00.959> in

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
very very suspect so if I'd have been in
