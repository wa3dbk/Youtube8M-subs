over<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.690> course<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> next<00:02:52.349> several

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
over the course of the next several

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.610 
over the course of the next several
months<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:54.209> one<00:02:54.390> thing<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.870> say<00:02:54.900> with

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
months the one thing I can say with

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.610 
months the one thing I can say with
certainty<00:02:55.829> is<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.110> focus<00:02:58.290> on

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
certainty is that I have to focus on

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.030 
certainty is that I have to focus on
jobs<00:02:59.269> because<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:01.200> hemorrhaging<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.769> jobs

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
jobs because the hemorrhaging of jobs

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.590 
jobs because the hemorrhaging of jobs
has<00:03:02.459> an<00:03:02.670> impact<00:03:03.709> obviously<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:05.600> consumer

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
has an impact obviously on consumer

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.190 
has an impact obviously on consumer
confidence<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.410> ability<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.769> people<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
confidence and the ability of people to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.530 
confidence and the ability of people to
to<00:03:10.200> buy<00:03:10.410> goods<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.859> services<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.489> can<00:03:12.389> have

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
to buy goods and services and can have

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.800 
to buy goods and services and can have
enormous<00:03:12.780> spillover<00:03:13.260> effects<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.389> think

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
enormous spillover effects and I think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.180 
enormous spillover effects and I think
it's<00:03:16.139> going<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.380> very<00:03:16.530> important<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:16.980> us

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
it's going to be very important for us

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.240 
it's going to be very important for us
to<00:03:17.370> provide<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:19.290> kinds<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.590> assistance<00:03:19.859> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
to provide the kinds of assistance to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.339 
to provide the kinds of assistance to
state<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.670> local<00:03:20.760> governments<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.959> make<00:03:22.109> sure

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
state and local governments to make sure

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.349 
state and local governments to make sure
that<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:22.829> don't<00:03:22.950> compound<00:03:23.400> some<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.299> the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
that they don't compound some of the

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.849 
that they don't compound some of the
problems<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.840> are<00:03:25.019> already<00:03:25.109> out<00:03:25.260> there<00:03:25.560> by

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
problems that are already out there by

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.920 
problems that are already out there by
having<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.310> initiate<00:03:27.030> major<00:03:27.209> layoffs<00:03:27.660> or

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
having to initiate major layoffs or

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.349 
having to initiate major layoffs or
initiate<00:03:28.709> tax<00:03:28.980> increases<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.730> there<00:03:30.150> are<00:03:30.239> some

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
initiate tax increases so there are some

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.430 
initiate tax increases so there are some
things<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.810> know<00:03:30.959> we're<00:03:31.139> going<00:03:31.169> to<00:03:31.290> have

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
things that we know we're going to have

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.599 
things that we know we're going to have
to<00:03:31.530> do<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.900> I'm<00:03:34.169> confident<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.130> new

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
to do but I'm confident that the new

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:36.949 
to do but I'm confident that the new
president<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.450> an<00:03:36.569> enormous<00:03:36.690> impact

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
president can have an enormous impact

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.400 
president can have an enormous impact
that's<00:03:37.530> why<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.739> ran<00:03:37.950> for<00:03:38.220> president<00:03:39.260> all<00:03:40.260> right

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
that's why I ran for president all right
