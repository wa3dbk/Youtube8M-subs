nice
so<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.610> 3ds<00:01:38.939> may<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.299> region-locked<00:01:40.320> for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so the 3ds may be region-locked for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.399 
so the 3ds may be region-locked for
Nintendo<00:01:41.490> 3ds<00:01:41.700> games<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.780> Nintendo<00:01:43.380> DS

to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.579> region<00:01:47.579> free<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.509> let's<00:01:48.750> try<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.770> came

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to be region free now let's try I came

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.749 
to be region free now let's try I came
from<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> UK<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> we're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:53.670> in

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
from the UK so we're going to put in

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.209 
from the UK so we're going to put in
last<00:01:54.000> window<00:01:54.240> excellent<00:01:54.960> title<00:01:55.290> never<00:01:55.920> came

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
last window excellent title never came

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.700 
last window excellent title never came
out<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:57.270> North<00:01:57.509> America

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.500 

window<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:05.640> there's<00:02:06.090> been<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.300> lot<00:02:06.480> of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
window now there's been a lot of

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.389 
window now there's been a lot of
speculation<00:02:07.140> about<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.500> game<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.009> working

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
speculation about this game not working

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.750 
speculation about this game not working
in<00:02:08.520> DSis<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.210> assure<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.750> does<00:02:09.960> and<00:02:10.460> it<00:02:11.460> also

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
in DSis I assure you it does and it also

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.720 
in DSis I assure you it does and it also
works<00:02:12.210> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> Nintendo<00:02:13.110> 3ds<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:14.550> that's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
works in the Nintendo 3ds so that's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.400 
works in the Nintendo 3ds so that's
actually<00:02:14.880> very<00:02:15.240> exciting<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.960> even<00:02:16.260> though

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
actually very exciting so even though

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.570 
actually very exciting so even though
the<00:02:16.830> Nintendo<00:02:17.610> 3ds<00:02:17.640> games<00:02:18.360> are<00:02:18.630> region-locked

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the Nintendo 3ds games are region-locked

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.050 
the Nintendo 3ds games are region-locked
the<00:02:20.580> DS<00:02:21.480> games<00:02:21.960> are<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.400> still<00:02:23.790> go

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the DS games are not so you can still go

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.760 
the DS games are not so you can still go
ahead<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.690> play<00:02:25.200> them<00:02:25.730> which<00:02:26.730> tells<00:02:27.090> me<00:02:27.270> that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
ahead and play them which tells me that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.090 
ahead and play them which tells me that
perhaps<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.850> games<00:02:30.090> themselves<00:02:30.830> are<00:02:31.830> what

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
perhaps the games themselves are what

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.730 
perhaps the games themselves are what
have<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.370> region<00:02:32.700> coding<00:02:33.020> I'm<00:02:34.020> not<00:02:34.500> entirely

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
have the region coding I'm not entirely

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.430 
have the region coding I'm not entirely
sure<00:02:34.950> about<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:36.270> perhaps<00:02:37.050> intended

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
sure about that but perhaps intended

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.199 
sure about that but perhaps intended
will<00:02:37.650> take<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.010> off<00:02:38.250> I'd<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.940> see<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
will take that off I'd like to see the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.530 
will take that off I'd like to see the
