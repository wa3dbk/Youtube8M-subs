00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
in cassette decks the belts I'll have to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.930 
in cassette decks the belts I'll have to
replace<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.420> belts<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.140> day

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
replace the belts one day

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.290 
replace the belts one day
think<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.450> already<00:03:07.350> replaced<00:03:08.040> one<00:03:08.520> belt<00:03:08.940> which

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
think I already replaced one belt which

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.180 
think I already replaced one belt which
is<00:03:09.920> hidden<00:03:10.920> away<00:03:11.130> behind<00:03:11.340> those<00:03:11.970> gears<00:03:13.190> that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
is hidden away behind those gears that

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.400 
is hidden away behind those gears that
belt<00:03:14.520> was<00:03:14.790> bad<00:03:15.060> whenever<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.080> cassette

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
belt was bad whenever I got the cassette

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.820 
belt was bad whenever I got the cassette
deck

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
deck

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.980 
deck
I<00:03:16.860> found<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.850> cassette<00:03:18.240> deck<00:03:18.390> at<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> dump

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
I found this cassette deck at the dump

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.600 
I found this cassette deck at the dump
and<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.200> dumb-butt<00:03:22.620> already<00:03:22.950> proof<00:03:23.340> that

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
and on the dumb-butt already proof that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.180 
and on the dumb-butt already proof that
it<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:23.940> high-quality<00:03:24.840> because<00:03:25.110> somebody<00:03:25.980> had

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
it was high-quality because somebody had

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.660 
it was high-quality because somebody had
thrown<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.700> huge<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.500> really<00:03:28.830> mean<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> huge

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
thrown a huge and I really mean a huge

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.180 
thrown a huge and I really mean a huge
television<00:03:30.240> on<00:03:30.690> top<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.530> cassette<00:03:31.920> deck

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
television on top of this cassette deck

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.840 
television on top of this cassette deck
and<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:33.780> really<00:03:34.200> had<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> hard<00:03:35.040> time<00:03:35.160> getting

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and I really had a hard time getting

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.670 
and I really had a hard time getting
that<00:03:36.080> television<00:03:37.080> carried<00:03:37.650> away<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:39.680> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
that television carried away and the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.320 
that television carried away and the
cassette<00:03:41.100> deck<00:03:41.370> has<00:03:41.970> survived<00:03:42.680> without<00:03:43.680> any

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
cassette deck has survived without any

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.330 
cassette deck has survived without any
dent<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:46.080> there<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.530> go

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.850 

however<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.670> will<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.810> replace<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.440> belts

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
however I will have to replace the belts

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.220 
however I will have to replace the belts
because<00:03:53.310> especially<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.390> capstan<00:03:54.840> belt<00:03:55.080> is

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
because especially the capstan belt is

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.490 
because especially the capstan belt is
kind<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.560> loose<00:03:59.360> and<00:04:00.360> here<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.050> have<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
kind of loose and here we have the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.330 
kind of loose and here we have the
electronics<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.350> main<00:04:04.650> circuit<00:04:05.130> board

electronics to see a main circuit board

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.650 
electronics to see a main circuit board
and<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.730> has<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> couple<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.360> additional

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
and it has a couple of additional

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.080 
and it has a couple of additional
circuit<00:04:07.260> boards<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.710> top<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.160> we<00:04:08.910> have

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
for the headphone amplifier it does have

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.810 
for the headphone amplifier it does have
a<00:04:19.950> separate<00:04:20.640> headphone<00:04:21.120> amplifier<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.820> then

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
a separate headphone amplifier and then

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.600 
a separate headphone amplifier and then
the<00:04:24.300> microphone<00:04:24.900> preamplifier<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:26.010> right

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the microphone preamplifier is right

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.460 
the microphone preamplifier is right
there

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
there

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.150 
there
and<00:04:31.910> that's<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.300> basically<00:04:33.540> for<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.410> inside

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
and that's it basically for the inside

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.110 
and that's it basically for the inside
of<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.580> key<00:04:35.790> dual<00:04:36.480> cassette<00:04:36.840> deck<00:04:41.120> behind

of the key dual cassette deck behind

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.920 
of the key dual cassette deck behind
this<00:04:42.710> metal<00:04:43.710> part<00:04:43.980> there<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.930> transformer

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
this metal part there is the transformer

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.580 
this metal part there is the transformer
and<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:47.760> had<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.240> replace<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.900> power<00:04:49.200> switch

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
and I had to replace this power switch

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.010 
and I had to replace this power switch
the<00:04:50.490> original<00:04:51.000> switch<00:04:51.300> would<00:04:51.510> not<00:04:51.720> stay

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
the original switch would not stay

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.970 
the original switch would not stay
inside<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:54.690> know<00:04:54.810> would<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.169> stay<00:04:55.500> pressed

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
inside you know would not stay pressed

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.380 
inside you know would not stay pressed
to<00:04:56.820> see<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.419> oh<00:04:58.520> not<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> plastic<00:04:59.850> part

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
to see you have a oh not a plastic part

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.190 
to see you have a oh not a plastic part
