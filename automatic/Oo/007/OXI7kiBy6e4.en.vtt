00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
using already yes for right now so RDS

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
using already yes for right now so RDS
delivers<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> fully<00:01:15.750> manager<00:01:16.170> database

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

customers worldwide that use us for

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
customers worldwide that use us for
production<00:01:20.700> mission-critical<00:01:21.270> DB<00:01:21.869> workloads

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
production mission-critical DB workloads

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.070 
production mission-critical DB workloads
and<00:01:22.759> with<00:01:23.759> provisioned<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.360> UPS<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.780> hope<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and with provisioned I UPS we hope to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
and with provisioned I UPS we hope to
expand<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> set<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.070> workloads<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.640> are

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
expand the set of workloads which are

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.440 
expand the set of workloads which are
appropriate<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:28.130> bringing<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.700> RDS

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
appropriate for bringing them on to RDS

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
appropriate for bringing them on to RDS
so<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.960> give<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> our<00:01:31.320> users<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:31.829> more

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so you give to our users a lot more

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.469 
so you give to our users a lot more
control<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> level<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.939> performance<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
control of the level of performance that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140 
control of the level of performance that
they<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.840> yes<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.799> when<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.070> create<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> DB

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
they get yes so when they create a DB

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
they get yes so when they create a DB
instance<00:01:36.299> they'll<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.900> able<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> specify

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
instance they'll be able to specify

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
instance they'll be able to specify
their<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.250> set<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> maximum<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.409> 10,000

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
their I up set up to a maximum of 10,000

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.660 
their I up set up to a maximum of 10,000
and<00:01:40.790> then<00:01:41.790> they'll<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.180> able<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.450> use<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and then they'll be able to use that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.020 
and then they'll be able to use that
worldwide
