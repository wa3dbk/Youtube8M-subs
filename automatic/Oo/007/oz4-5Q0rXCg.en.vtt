00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hi, people today. I'm here to give more. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.319
 a tip for you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.910
 using the vinegar white vinegar and the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.860
 sodium bicarbonate 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.040
 today I'm going to teach you a very tip 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 simple thing we usually share 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.770
 enough on the internet on facebook and even 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.900
 already in our blog is to replace the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.480
 fabric softener for vinegar or 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.130
 bicarbonate of sodium I usually 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.610
 I use white vinegar for being more 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 cheaper than here where I live is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 the baking soda I have here 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.750
 difficulty finding quantities 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.809
 larger than this for example that is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 235 serious if you have facility where 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.940
 Do you live to find those? 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.899
 packs of one pound or five kilograms 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.480
 makes it much easier 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.170
 until the use of vinegar brown in that way 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 exactly how I would use the softener 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.170
 I use it for my machine that is 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.729
 small and maximum load of six kilos 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 I use 100 ml of white vinegar and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.610
 place a storage tank where you should place 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.340
 the softener even people do not stay with 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.799
 clothing salad smell perhaps earlier 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.080
 you feel if and when you take the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.420
 machine smell but then when 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 the clothes will go to the sun will dry 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 she does not smell of vinegar 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.479
 really loved the fibers 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.909
 the other alternative that would be the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.110
 sodium bicarbonate at the site of 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.540
 softener 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.810
 when I use sometimes I miss the vinegar 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.939
 white because I use it for various things 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.729
 let's say so when I'm going to use 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.159
 baking soda to my machine 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.390
 which is a small charge that at most 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.909
 six kilos as I said I use 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.030
 two tablespoons baking soda 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.960
 sodium and place it where it should 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 put the softener on 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.619
 these two products can also be 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.320
 used in the normal washing cycle of the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.000
 clothes but there is another story 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.090
 if you want to use these 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.550
 quantities and then on a test 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.020
 depending on the size of the load of your 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.510
 machine can be what you need 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 use more or less 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.100
 or you are satisfied with this 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.010
 amount that I suggested remembering people 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.790
 that because the new use but ian รง 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.470
 usually on the clothes first place is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.300
 for the sake of economy 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.630
 I think it comes out much cheaper 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.680
 use the second binary is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.959
 also for the sake of logic I am not 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.290
 so that person being always 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.300
 worried about the ecology although I do not 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.330
 try to use less products 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.690
 aggressive to the environment 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.120
 and I think it works, I do not 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.670
 issue of clothes out of the machine already 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.380
 I 'm going to make a video too. 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.810
 showing you how I 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.640
 I use fabric softener at home here not 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.549
 it means that we are not on my list 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360
 the supermarket but I use another 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.190
 form 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.470
 You may have heard of several 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.970
 But I'll show you the way 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.640
 I usually wear it here and I will 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.310
 Also, the tip of today is 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.130
 this replace the softener with vinegar 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.840
 or by baking soda there you 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.910
 can you ask yourself more about what kind of 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.290
 injunction 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.410
 I usually use alcohol vinegar 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.269
 because I find here much cheaper 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.000
 than other types of white vinegar 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.910
 but may also be apple cider vinegar 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.370
 it is also well suited to use 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.220
 in the yellow house cleanings where you 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.380
 live in the country in the state where you live 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.200
 did not have any water, there's no problem to 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.209
 people use whatever they have, it's important 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.950
 is that white vinegar can not be 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.200
 that red vinegar red wine 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.780
 because you can even find your clothes by 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.090
 cause of the color of the vi nothing that you 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.910
 can then take advantage of this tip who 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.250
 use if you want to share 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.100
 other ways of using leave 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.290
 a wink in the right comments and to 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.810
 next bend our video sign up 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.959
 in our channel is participating with the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.580
 giving people walks also leaving some 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.170
 comment can say I want you 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.430
 think about the tips we have 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.430
 not good
