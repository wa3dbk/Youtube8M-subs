smitten<00:00:11.219> ice-cream<00:00:12.980> started<00:00:13.980> off<00:00:14.070> actually

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
smitten ice-cream started off actually

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.490 
smitten ice-cream started off actually
at<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.880> GSB<00:00:15.179> when<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.929> drove<00:00:16.350> into

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
at the GSB when I drove into

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
at the GSB when I drove into
entrepreneurship<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.460> took<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> bunch<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
entrepreneurship and took a bunch of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.359 
entrepreneurship and took a bunch of
classes<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:18.930> space<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.710> decided<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
classes in that space and decided to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.160 
classes in that space and decided to
focus<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.820> something<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.240> loved<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.960> was

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
focus on something I loved and was

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.070 
focus on something I loved and was
passionate<00:00:22.380> about<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.460> ice<00:00:23.699> cream

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
passionate about and that was ice cream

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
passionate about and that was ice cream
my<00:00:25.080> goal<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> take<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> project<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.820> loved

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
my goal was to take a project I loved

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.380 
my goal was to take a project I loved
and<00:00:27.330> make<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.810> even<00:00:27.900> better<00:00:29.029> looked<00:00:30.029> into<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and make it even better looked into the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.359 
and make it even better looked into the
science<00:00:30.750> behind<00:00:30.929> ice<00:00:31.170> cream<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> figured<00:00:32.219> out

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
science behind ice cream and figured out

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940 
science behind ice cream and figured out
that<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> lot<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.450> quality<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.530> product

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
that a lot of the quality of the product

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.270 
that a lot of the quality of the product
is<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.460> result<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.390> ice<00:00:36.630> crystal<00:00:37.050> formation<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
is a result of ice crystal formation the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
is a result of ice crystal formation the
colder<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> freeze<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> product<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.200> smaller

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
colder you freeze a product the smaller

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.410 
colder you freeze a product the smaller
the<00:00:40.710> ice<00:00:40.860> crystals<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.180> smaller

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the ice crystals can be and the smaller

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.850 
the ice crystals can be and the smaller
the<00:00:42.600> ice<00:00:42.629> crystals<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> smoother<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the ice crystals the smoother the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.700 
the ice crystals the smoother the
texture<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> could<00:00:45.809> actually

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
texture can be so if I could actually

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.319 
texture can be so if I could actually
freeze<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.670> cold<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.149> could

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
freeze it really really cold I could

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
freeze it really really cold I could
make<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> order<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.260> started<00:00:50.129> playing

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
make it to order I started playing

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
make it to order I started playing
around<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.700> liquid<00:00:51.059> nitrogen<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
around with liquid nitrogen which is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650 
around with liquid nitrogen which is
negative<00:00:52.530> 321<00:00:53.520> degrees<00:00:53.640> Fahrenheit<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit and I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit and I
started<00:00:54.899> literally<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.469> GSB<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.460> sourcing

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
started literally at GSB I was sourcing

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.580 
started literally at GSB I was sourcing
a<00:00:57.030> tank<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> liquid<00:00:57.420> nitrogen<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.199> making<00:00:58.500> ice

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
a tank of liquid nitrogen and making ice

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770 
a tank of liquid nitrogen and making ice
cream<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:58.980> backyard<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.730> pretty<00:01:00.480> much<00:01:00.629> by

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
cream in my backyard and pretty much by

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.060 
cream in my backyard and pretty much by
the<00:01:00.809> end<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> my<00:01:01.109> two<00:01:01.170> years<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> was

known as the ice cream girl some people

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.579 
known as the ice cream girl some people
didn't<00:01:04.110> even<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.320> my<00:01:04.409> name

didn't even know my name

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
didn't even know my name
I<00:01:04.739> was<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> ice<00:01:05.280> cream<00:01:05.309> girl<00:01:06.020> actually

spent the next two years after the GSB

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
spent the next two years after the GSB
working<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> basement<00:01:10.439> shop<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
working in a basement shop with a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.640 
working in a basement shop with a
brilliant<00:01:11.790> engineer<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.350> just

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
brilliant engineer and really just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.630 
brilliant engineer and really just
making<00:01:13.770> ice<00:01:13.920> cream<00:01:14.070> over<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.400> over<00:01:14.549> again

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
making ice cream over and over again

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
making ice cream over and over again
with<00:01:14.909> different<00:01:15.299> types<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> mixing<00:01:16.229> devices

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
with different types of mixing devices

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
with different types of mixing devices
and<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.280> ended<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.390> prototype<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> our

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and we ended up with a prototype of our

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
and we ended up with a prototype of our
now<00:01:20.040> machine<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.580> use<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.790> our<00:01:20.850> shop

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
now machine that we use at our shop

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
now machine that we use at our shop
which<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.450> call<00:01:21.659> burr<00:01:22.369> what<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> decided<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> do

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
which we call burr what I decided to do

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
which we call burr what I decided to do
was<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.659> sort<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:26.130> rogue<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:27.150> bit

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
was just sort of go rogue a little bit

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
was just sort of go rogue a little bit
and<00:01:27.600> figured<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.409> needed<00:01:28.590> something<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> carry

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and figured I needed something to carry

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.550 
and figured I needed something to carry
this<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.909> forty<00:01:30.420> pound<00:01:30.689> stainless

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
this you know forty pound stainless

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
this you know forty pound stainless
steel<00:01:31.799> device<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.939> tank<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> liquid

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
steel device and a tank of liquid

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.200 
steel device and a tank of liquid
nitrogen<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.619> also<00:01:35.159> wanted<00:01:35.759> something<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
nitrogen and I also wanted something to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
nitrogen and I also wanted something to
sort<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> prove<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.409> trying<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
sort of prove that I was trying to do a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
sort of prove that I was trying to do a
wholesome<00:01:38.340> approach<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> ice<00:01:39.030> cream<00:01:39.210> despite

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
wholesome approach to ice cream despite

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
wholesome approach to ice cream despite
that<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> looks<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> modern<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that it looks kind of modern so the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
that it looks kind of modern so the
Radio<00:01:42.509> Flyer<00:01:42.659> wagon<00:01:42.799> idea<00:01:43.799> sort<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.250> came

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
Radio Flyer wagon idea sort of came

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.679 
Radio Flyer wagon idea sort of came
about

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
about

you

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.039 

I<00:02:47.439> actually<00:02:47.950> get<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.489> see<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:48.939> fog<00:02:49.390> so

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
I actually get to see this fog so

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.770 
I actually get to see this fog so
nitrogen<00:02:50.980> vapor<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.819> forms<00:02:52.209> around<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
machines San Francisco fog over the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.679 
machines San Francisco fog over the
machine<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.859> has<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:57.340> double<00:02:57.760> helical<00:02:58.180> mixer

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
machine it has a double helical mixer

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.229 
machine it has a double helical mixer
which<00:02:59.109> together<00:02:59.469> sort<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.459> scrapes<00:03:00.819> every

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
which together sort of scrapes every

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.479 
which together sort of scrapes every
surface<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.659> itself<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.499> create<00:03:03.129> the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
surface of itself to create the

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.640 
surface of itself to create the
exceptionally<00:03:04.060> small<00:03:04.299> ice<00:03:04.480> crystal<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.139> then

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
exceptionally small ice crystal and then

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.649 
exceptionally small ice crystal and then
it<00:03:05.769> has<00:03:06.010> private<00:03:06.730> Airy<00:03:06.849> software<00:03:07.420> that

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
it has private Airy software that

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.110 
it has private Airy software that
controls<00:03:08.049> viscosity<00:03:08.769> inducing<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.700> it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
controls viscosity inducing so it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.759 
controls viscosity inducing so it
actually<00:03:10.450> gives<00:03:10.599> real-time<00:03:11.019> feedback<00:03:11.349> and

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
actually gives real-time feedback and

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.649 
actually gives real-time feedback and
the<00:03:11.829> machine<00:03:12.129> is<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.819> quote<00:03:12.939> smart<00:03:13.389> and

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
the machine is going to quote smart and

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.199 
the machine is going to quote smart and
it<00:03:14.200> knows<00:03:14.409> when<00:03:14.919> it's<00:03:15.099> created<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.060> perfect

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
it knows when it's created the perfect

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.199 
it knows when it's created the perfect
scoop<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.900> stops<00:03:17.139> for<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.939> think<00:03:18.939> it's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
scoop and it stops for you I think it's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.819 
scoop and it stops for you I think it's
really<00:03:19.389> hard<00:03:19.689> to<00:03:19.840> do<00:03:19.930> two<00:03:20.079> things<00:03:20.109> better<00:03:20.620> than

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
really hard to do two things better than

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.289 
really hard to do two things better than
anyone<00:03:21.069> else<00:03:21.159> in<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.340> world<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.609> we<00:03:21.790> don't<00:03:21.969> we

anyone else in the world so we don't we

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.179 
anyone else in the world so we don't we
just<00:03:22.510> focus<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:22.959> one<00:03:23.109> thing<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.829> we<00:03:24.010> make

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
just focus on that one thing and we make

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.559 
just focus on that one thing and we make
sure<00:03:24.219> that<00:03:24.370> everything<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.180> comes<00:03:25.329> out<00:03:25.540> of
