any<00:03:04.959> other<00:03:05.349> year<00:03:05.829> probably<00:03:06.549> both<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.299> these

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
any other year probably both of these

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.270 
any other year probably both of these
games<00:03:07.720> would<00:03:07.959> have<00:03:08.049> made<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.290> onto<00:03:08.440> my<00:03:08.590> top<00:03:08.950> 10

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.970 
didn't feel that either of these games
broke<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.090> mold<00:03:16.329> enough<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:17.139> warrant<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.620> spot

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
