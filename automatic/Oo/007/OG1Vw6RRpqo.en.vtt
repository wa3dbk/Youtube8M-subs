00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
closed bridge is designed for a specific

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
closed bridge is designed for a specific
control<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.550> shots<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> draw<00:00:30.480> where

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
control of shots like in the draw where

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
control of shots like in the draw where
you<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> hit<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> cue<00:00:31.529> ball<00:00:31.590> harder<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you have to hit the cue ball harder and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.920 
you have to hit the cue ball harder and
things<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.059> let's<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.630> into<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
things like that so let's get into the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
things like that so let's get into the
formation<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> closed<00:00:34.829> bridge<00:00:35.600> you'll

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
formation of the closed bridge you'll

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600 
formation of the closed bridge you'll
notice<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> hand<00:00:37.890> starts<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
notice that the hand starts out in a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 
notice that the hand starts out in a
very<00:00:38.760> unique<00:00:39.149> way<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.809> simply<00:00:40.050> make<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
very unique way we just simply make a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.540 
very unique way we just simply make a
fist<00:00:40.590> we're<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> keep<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.340> very

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
fist we're going to keep this very

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.440 
fist we're going to keep this very
simple<00:00:41.670> process

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
simple process

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
simple process
we'll<00:00:42.719> make<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> fist<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.829> keep<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
we'll make a fist like this and keep it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.139 
we'll make a fist like this and keep it
straight<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> don't<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.059> your

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
straight in here now you don't want your

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.850 
straight in here now you don't want your
hand<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> fall<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.809> keep<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.350> straight<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.680> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
hand to fall down keep it straight up in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.369 
hand to fall down keep it straight up in
here<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.510> then<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> take

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
here like that then we're going to take

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.260 
here like that then we're going to take
the<00:00:49.559> index<00:00:50.070> finger<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> thumb<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the index finger with the thumb and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
the index finger with the thumb and
create<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> loop<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.440> we're<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> touch

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
create a loop now we're going to touch

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
create a loop now we're going to touch
the<00:00:53.219> finger<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:53.789> tip<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> edge

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the finger right tip right to the edge

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.560 
the finger right tip right to the edge
of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> thumb<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.699> creates<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> loop<00:00:57.329> now

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
of the thumb and that creates a loop now

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
of the thumb and that creates a loop now
in<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.930> loop<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.859> cue<00:00:59.100> stick<00:00:59.160> goes<00:00:59.550> if

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in that loop the cue stick goes if

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
in that loop the cue stick goes if
you're<00:01:00.629> having<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> hard<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.199> keeping<00:01:01.559> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you're having a hard time keeping that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.799 
you're having a hard time keeping that
loop<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.969> might<00:01:03.120> want<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> drop<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
loop you might want to put a drop of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.299 
loop you might want to put a drop of
superglue<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.650> between<00:01:04.769> those<00:01:05.070> two

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
superglue right there between those two

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
superglue right there between those two
fingers<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.970> you'll<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.270> those<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.689> they'll

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
fingers and you'll have those so they'll

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
fingers and you'll have those so they'll
stay<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.229> against<00:01:07.560> each<00:01:07.680> other<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.700> cue

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
stay right against each other as the cue

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
stay right against each other as the cue
stick<00:01:08.970> goes<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> loop<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.409> simply

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
stick goes in the loop then we simply

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.340 
stick goes in the loop then we simply
spread<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> fingers<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> table<00:01:13.229> like

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
spread the fingers on the table like

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.249 
spread the fingers on the table like
this<00:01:13.530> underneath<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.670> loop<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.780> let's<00:01:16.140> go

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
this underneath the loop so let's go

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:16.789 
this underneath the loop so let's go
through<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.500> again

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
through that again

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.060 
through that again
the<00:01:17.400> fist<00:01:17.700> straight<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> air<00:01:18.860> making<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the fist straight in the air making the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.060 
the fist straight in the air making the
loop<00:01:20.570> connecting<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> index<00:01:22.200> finger<00:01:22.530> tip<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
loop connecting the index finger tip to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
loop connecting the index finger tip to
the<00:01:23.189> thumb<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> placing<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> cue<00:01:24.869> stick<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the thumb and placing the cue stick in

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.830 
the thumb and placing the cue stick in
the<00:01:25.500> loop<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.909> simply<00:01:27.330> creating<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the loop and then simply creating the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
the loop and then simply creating the
foundation<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> loop<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> three

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
foundation for the loop with the three

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850 
foundation for the loop with the three
fingers<00:01:30.000> spread<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.360> underneath<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.869> now

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
fingers spread out underneath it now

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.899 
fingers spread out underneath it now
when<00:01:32.009> you're<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> position<00:01:32.460> you're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
when you're in that position you're

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
when you're in that position you're
going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.240> what's<00:01:33.390> called<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.750> good<00:01:33.990> solid

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
going to have what's called a good solid

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289 
going to have what's called a good solid
closed<00:01:34.799> bridge<00:01:35.159> there's<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.090> other<00:01:36.180> thing

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
closed bridge there's one other thing

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.120 
closed bridge there's one other thing
here<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.659> need<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> keep<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.140> mind<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.680> that's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
here we need to keep in mind and that's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
here we need to keep in mind and that's
the<00:01:38.310> tension<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> cue<00:01:39.930> stick<00:01:39.990> must<00:01:40.380> be

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the tension that the cue stick must be

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.010 
the tension that the cue stick must be
as<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> goes<00:01:41.070> through<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.729> loop<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.990> let's

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
as it goes through the loop so let's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
as it goes through the loop so let's
kind<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> illustrate<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.509> you'll

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
kind of illustrate that now you'll

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.030 
kind of illustrate that now you'll
notice<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> cue<00:01:46.710> stick<00:01:46.770> I'm

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
notice here we have the cue stick I'm

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.920 
notice here we have the cue stick I'm
going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> hold<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.640> position<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
going to hold it in this position if you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450 
going to hold it in this position if you
hold<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.200> too<00:01:49.350> tightly<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> loop

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
hold it too tightly with this loop

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.219 
hold it too tightly with this loop
you're<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.450> able<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> cue<00:01:52.020> stick

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you're not going to be able to cue stick

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.420 
you're not going to be able to cue stick
through<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> gets<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> sticky

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
through there and it gets kind of sticky

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.160 
through there and it gets kind of sticky
and<00:01:53.549> some<00:01:53.759> people<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.090> powder<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:55.049> what

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and some people use powder actually what

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.980 
and some people use powder actually what
you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.579> simply

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
you can do is you can just simply

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.600 
you can do is you can just simply
lighten<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> tension<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.040> finger<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
lighten the tension on this finger and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.429 
lighten the tension on this finger and
the<00:02:00.060> cue<00:02:00.270> stick<00:02:00.329> will<00:02:00.630> slowly<00:02:01.140> go<00:02:01.409> through

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the cue stick will slowly go through

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
the cue stick will slowly go through
your<00:02:01.829> hand<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.790> want

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
your hand like that now you don't want

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179 
your hand like that now you don't want
to<00:02:03.000> fall<00:02:03.299> out<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> nice

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
to fall out but you want to be a nice

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.109 
to fall out but you want to be a nice
smooth<00:02:06.180> consistent<00:02:06.990> steady<00:02:07.320> tension<00:02:08.119> another

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
smooth consistent steady tension another

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
smooth consistent steady tension another
way<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.479> approach<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> can

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
way you can approach that as you can

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
way you can approach that as you can
start<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.830> position<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:11.970> bring

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
start in this position and then bring

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.990 
start in this position and then bring
the<00:02:12.510> hand<00:02:12.750> back<00:02:12.870> down<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.470> table

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the hand back down to the table

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.750 
the hand back down to the table
the<00:02:14.150> closed<00:02:14.690> bridge<00:02:14.900> already<00:02:15.170> in<00:02:15.320> position<00:02:15.830> so

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the closed bridge already in position so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.060 
the closed bridge already in position so
that's<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.150> way<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.300> form<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.380> closed<00:02:18.680> bridge

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
that's the way to form the closed bridge

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.920 
that's the way to form the closed bridge
where<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.360> use<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.630> for<00:02:20.660> certain

types of more difficult shots and that's

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.340 
types of more difficult shots and that's
