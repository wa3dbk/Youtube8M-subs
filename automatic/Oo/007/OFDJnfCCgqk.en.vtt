00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 when it swings 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:16.230
 went there not with chicken under this you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.350
 you write a day because a year layout 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.630
 idea look at the design 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.630
 have a cool smoke 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.190
 I understand that you shoot the film as 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.550
 explain to normal people why we 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.989
 again nearly 6 hours registered Developing 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.000
 machines to manifest 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.920
 9 films 2 light all negative than 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 sense can also be given in the laboratory 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.440
 why bother to film 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.750
 just buy do not understand you will be bought 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.080
 filmed the film here and tormented 6 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.909
 o'clock 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.670
 listen to something causal 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.220
 communication does it seem different to almost 18 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 digit dig up be because the film 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.539
 this is the soul in the figure damned satanic 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.259
 no soul he is also a soul not even stones 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.570
 leaf only analog pure analog color 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.360
 which which is simply leading the substance 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.789
 Your account on the market is our soul. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 in all that you are his 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.830
 I agree not one in the film to respect him 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.869
 easier I do not know in my can their film 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.369
 or figure anything but how to explain 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.350
 people who shoot a figure that 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.990
 feelings of joy and a couple when you are here 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.090
 show not the ship let them try 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.369
 hang it doused just understand what 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.259
 either you did complete shit this is complete 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.600
 anyone who can not show to lose 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.600
 just space this time you look 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.680
 or do you understand that this is cool 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.060
 snapshot and for the sake of this one snapshot 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.250
 generally apply to aids film 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.630
 cameras from the turnout with the purchase of film with 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.320
 all for nuances with barrel games and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.320
 other things will 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.079
 I could speak and that's why 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.750
 filmed and it's really 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:27.340
 may of course there before when someone because 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.950
 what is direct recording to the service 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.390
 I wondered why if my tapes 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.459
 I could sell them before so I wouldn't 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 could achieve such flowers there approached 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 in the picture that was laid already in 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.370
 film that is a matter of frame scan I 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.799
 everything is pretty and nothing needs to be done 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.420
 the brightness is just abruptly everything 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.909
 very simple film handles 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.099
 skill on the figure can be applied 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.190
 plenty of snow when you buy 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.319
 film roll 12 or 10 frames for 85 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.239
 hryvnia you think about each 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.099
 as much as it costs and how it is necessary 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.260
 approach this situation correctly 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.829
 put the light where the models look and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.190
 so on and develop yourself a special 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:11.480
 such a trait that brings you up like 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.090
 take a professional after the film figure 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.440
 you already have something left ie you 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.540
 you start to see the frame 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.620
 more so detailed 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.160
 coming up generally coming up to this 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.769
 differently you people people they 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.620
 immediately from the film and rather immediately to the color and 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.720
 they begin this they do not know it they do not 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:39.379
 concepts are not on the situation of classes clatter 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:40.520
 makes a lot of shit don't be offended 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.920
 but so often 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.360
 as it really is now 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.580
 sometimes very useful for prevention 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.790
 film is very useful 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.390
 I recommend this as a trip to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.390
 mineral water 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.570
 ass but man is not important to you 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.570
 film must remove the tape to lie down 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.940
 from the circle it's just cool and subject 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.510
 useful for your photo noticeable it 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.870
 comparison 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.260
 it's really worse than a drug if you took it off 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.260
 on tape 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 have a smoke
