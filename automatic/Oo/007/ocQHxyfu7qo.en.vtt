00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
predicted it just looks like a normal

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.250 
predicted it just looks like a normal
twist<00:02:08.890> there's<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.160> much<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.579> a<00:02:10.670> kink<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
twist there's not much of a kink in the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.740 
twist there's not much of a kink in the
middle<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.190> we'll<00:02:14.120> see<00:02:14.360> how<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.480> looks

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
middle but we'll see how it looks

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.390 
middle but we'll see how it looks

them once
taking<00:02:17.710> on<00:02:17.890> every<00:02:18.220> I'm<00:02:18.340> back<00:02:18.550> again<00:02:18.580> i<00:02:19.270> would

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
taking on every I'm back again i would

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.680 
taking on every I'm back again i would
say<00:02:19.690> about<00:02:19.810> half<00:02:20.320> an<00:02:20.530> hour<00:02:20.620> 40<00:02:21.160> minutes<00:02:21.190> later

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
say about half an hour 40 minutes later

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.680 
say about half an hour 40 minutes later
as<00:02:22.690> with<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.730> installation<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.150> tile<00:02:25.420> is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
as with the installation this tile is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.410 
as with the installation this tile is
quite<00:02:26.260> tedious<00:02:26.500> because<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.580> have<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.910> find

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
quite tedious because we have to find

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.870 
quite tedious because we have to find
the<00:02:28.630> relevant<00:02:28.900> snip<00:02:29.620> them<00:02:29.860> at<00:02:30.400> your<00:02:30.670> roots

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
the relevant snip them at your roots

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.400 
the relevant snip them at your roots
instead<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.450> kind<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.690> unraveling<00:02:32.230> them

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
instead of just kind of unraveling them

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.330 
instead of just kind of unraveling them
when<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.890> do<00:02:33.040> not<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.250> normal<00:02:33.490> twist<00:02:34.420> oh<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
when you do not a normal twist oh so the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.730 
when you do not a normal twist oh so the
results<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.150> looks<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.510> normal<00:02:37.740> a

yet<00:05:07.670> again<00:05:07.970> because<00:05:08.300> my<00:05:08.330> hair<00:05:09.050> i<00:05:09.640> thought

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
yet again because my hair i thought

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.870 
yet again because my hair i thought
would<00:05:10.790> have<00:05:11.170> caught<00:05:12.170> up<00:05:12.350> with<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.880> one-sided

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
would have caught up with the one-sided

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.490 
would have caught up with the one-sided
back<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:14.450> probably<00:05:14.960> gonna<00:05:15.140> give<00:05:15.320> me<00:05:15.470> a

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
back so it's probably gonna give me a

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.660 
back so it's probably gonna give me a
fuller<00:05:15.920> look<00:05:16.250> but<00:05:17.120> long<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.380> long<00:05:18.680> fuller<00:05:19.130> but

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
fuller look but long a long fuller but

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.090 
fuller look but long a long fuller but
fuller<00:05:19.880> look<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.810> imma<00:05:21.200> be<00:05:21.440> interested<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:21.950> see

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
fuller look so imma be interested in see

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.780 
fuller look so imma be interested in see
how<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:23.030> shape<00:05:23.480> of<00:05:23.660> my<00:05:23.810> hair<00:05:24.320> I'm<00:05:24.920> has<00:05:25.310> changed

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
how the shape of my hair I'm has changed

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.790 
how the shape of my hair I'm has changed
because<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:26.090> could<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.420> I<00:05:26.660> guess<00:05:27.230> about<00:05:27.740> two

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
because I could it I guess about two

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.740 
because I could it I guess about two
months<00:05:28.100> ago<00:05:28.490> now<00:05:28.790> coming<00:05:29.060> up<00:05:29.150> on<00:05:29.300> two<00:05:29.450> months

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
months ago now coming up on two months

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.190 
months ago now coming up on two months
so<00:05:30.290> in<00:05:30.440> total<00:05:30.680> i<00:05:31.220> will<00:05:31.550> be<00:05:31.760> just<00:05:32.690> short<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:33.080> a

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
so in total i will be just short of a

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.830 
so in total i will be just short of a
year<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:33.590> i<00:05:33.680> would<00:05:33.830> have<00:05:34.450> had<00:05:35.450> them<00:05:35.660> removed

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
year and i would have had them removed

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.630 
year and i would have had them removed
so<00:05:36.170> it<00:05:36.380> would<00:05:36.470> be<00:05:36.560> quite<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.830> significant

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
so it would be quite a significant

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.050 
so it would be quite a significant
difference<00:05:38.060> um<00:05:38.560> other<00:05:39.560> than<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:40.280> i'm

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
difference um other than that i'm

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.530 
difference um other than that i'm
nothing<00:05:41.540> else<00:05:41.690> is<00:05:41.870> going<00:05:42.080> on<00:05:42.230> with<00:05:42.440> my<00:05:42.710> hair<00:05:43.220> um

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
nothing else is going on with my hair um

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.700 
nothing else is going on with my hair um
it's<00:05:44.540> kind<00:05:45.020> of<00:05:45.200> tricky<00:05:45.980> to<00:05:46.370> find<00:05:46.760> cells<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.720> do

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
it's kind of tricky to find cells to do

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.770 
it's kind of tricky to find cells to do
