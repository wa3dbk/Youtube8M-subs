00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.779
 bright and unique the eiffel tower or if 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.010
 gentlemen eiffel tower for all of you 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:38.489
 idolatrous lovers and idols before paris 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 Well, here came the eiffel tower, nothing more 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.290
 and nothing less should we say that this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.690
 tower was not called like that at first 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 no no no no no no name was called 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.750
 eiffel tower was called 300 tower 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 meters which was a plan between several 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.539
 people who wanted to build it and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 end of accounts was built by the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.390
 french engineer gustave eiffel well is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.790
 that's why that's why it has that name 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.619
 because gustave eiffel was the one that 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 built 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.960
 is this tower like everyone else what 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.439
 You know, it's located in France 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 that's right in the capital in paris and so 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.960
 is located at the end of the field of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.319
 Mars like this on Tuesday at the edge of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.009
 Sena river is a monument we seemed not 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:32.549
 symbol of france the capital itself and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.390
 the monument is the most visited in the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.020
 world world if it is the most visited by 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.580
 the world with 7.1 million tourists 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 every year 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.740
 the eiffel tower was originally 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.159
 constructed 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.560
 with a height of 300 meters but at 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.579
 final they put an antenna on an antenna 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 which measures 24 meters which completes its 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.510
 height in 324 meters 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.400
 It was the tallest structure around the 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.479
 world the most the highest of all the 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.870
 world for 41 years so important 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.160
 is the eiffel tower initially these 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.800
 are data that maybe not many people 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.130
 know but the eiffel tower was used 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.750
 by the army to make tests of 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.450
 communication like this is 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.850
 those antennas not that the military 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.160
 they occupy to transmit data because they 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.770
 he occupied for that the eiffel tower and more 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.890
 ahead it was used as a transmitter of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.750
 radio and television programs 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.180
 even for a long time the first 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.890
 part or the first section of the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.350
 television programs were broadcast 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.890
 thanks to the antenna that is on top 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.800
 from the eiffel tower that's how they are 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.800
 listening was transmitted television 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.330
 analog through the antenna that 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.180
 I was at the top of the eiffel tower 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.269
 first it was for military use then it was 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.820
 everyday use and not only was there 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.640
 of ornament not clear later on 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.940
 used as a tourist attraction and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.390
 all 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.540
 we were very happy but well this is 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.090
 this is something therefore impressive not 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.870
 let's follow how is how the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.450
 good eiffel tower is not something strange 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.750
 saying it is not a funny thing to say the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.170
 eiffel tower is integrated by three 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.120
 floors the three floors of the eiffel tower 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.330
 they are different they did not have their 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.300
 construction period all done in 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.930
 iron in metal is very well very well 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.470
 built and the first floor is a 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.020
 section as of curious facts not by 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.970
 example is said that in the first 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.900
 section on the first floor of the tower 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.550
 eiffel existed a spiral staircase 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.100
 not that at the beginning of the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.120
 construction of the monument went up 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.550
 the summit to the top of the building without 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.600
 However, this staircase was dismantled 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.270
 in 1986 during an important work of 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.760
 renovation of the tower and this staircase 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.720
 not that it came from the first floor 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.390
 to the summit 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.000
 was dismantled and dissected in 22 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.090
 parts and you will ask yourself good 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.700
 so much iron so heavy what the fuck 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.820
 They made it very easy for those 22 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.820
 sections one of the parts was saved 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.880
 as a museum inside the eiffel tower and 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.150
 the other 21 parts were auctioned 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.090
 with wealthy and affluent people of the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.660
 united states or asia and where is the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.980
 baron from the pure money and babe and 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.840
 then this for the collectors 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.780
 they did what they wanted and they 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.390
 they keep their parts not interesting 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.820
 after second floor of the eiffel tower 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.220
 in this on this second floor is 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.500
 specials you have to put a complete and 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.170
 total attention because on this floor you 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.840
 they installed glass windows this is 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.390
 glass windows to allow a 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.780
 very wide view from above so that 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.090
 it looks nice not luxurious and they installed 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.860
 metal protection fences for 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.030
 avoid any attempt to jump to 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.260
 empty or suicide of some loquillo that 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.450
 if wanted 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.190
 the Eiffel Tower as you do not see here no 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.930
 you can kill because it 's heritage 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.700

 nice glass and everything cool but with 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.940
 many protections so that people do not 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.700
 it occurred to him to kill himself I'm not sure 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.710
 that if it had happened in the end and in the 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.900
