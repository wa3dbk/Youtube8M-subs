alright<00:00:16.980> let's<00:00:17.160> install<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> fabric<00:00:18.000> we'll

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
alright let's install the fabric we'll

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.240 
alright let's install the fabric we'll
start<00:00:18.539> by<00:00:18.720> inserting<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.289> tension<00:00:19.740> bar<00:00:19.980> through

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
start by inserting a tension bar through

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
start by inserting a tension bar through
the<00:00:20.340> end<00:00:20.490> loops<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> fabric<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the end loops of the fabric and the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.189 
the end loops of the fabric and the
tension<00:00:22.590> bands<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> terminal<00:00:23.640> Pole<00:00:24.199> now

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
tension bands on the terminal Pole now

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.810 
tension bands on the terminal Pole now
just<00:00:25.470> unroll<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> fabric<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> ground

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
just unroll the fabric on the ground

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.160 
just unroll the fabric on the ground
then<00:00:29.820> I'll<00:00:30.090> stand<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.539> against<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> fence

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
then I'll stand it up against the fence

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.920 
then I'll stand it up against the fence
and<00:00:31.610> walk<00:00:32.610> along<00:00:32.790> taking<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.390> any<00:00:33.570> excess

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and walk along taking up any excess

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
and walk along taking up any excess
slack<00:00:34.200> I'm<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> attach<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.969> few

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
slack I'm also going to attach a few

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.030 
slack I'm also going to attach a few
wire<00:00:36.420> ties<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> top<00:00:37.320> rail<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> hold

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
wire ties to the top rail just to hold

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
wire ties to the top rail just to hold
it<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.280> place<00:00:38.750> next<00:00:39.750> we'll<00:00:40.079> pull<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> fabric

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it in place next we'll pull the fabric

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
it in place next we'll pull the fabric
tight<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.640> easier<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.030> we

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
tight and that will be easier if we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
tight and that will be easier if we
remove<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.840> excess<00:00:43.170> fabric<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.190> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
remove the excess fabric to do that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.680 
remove the excess fabric to do that
we're<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we're going to take out one of the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
we're going to take out one of the
strands<00:00:46.050> from<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> fabric<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:46.829> opening<00:00:47.219> up

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
strands from the fabric by opening up

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.600 
strands from the fabric by opening up
the<00:00:47.460> loop<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.789> top<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:49.309> at<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> bottom

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the loop at the top and at the bottom

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.130 
the loop at the top and at the bottom
and<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.500> twisting<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> strand<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:54.140> alright

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and then twisting the strand out alright

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
and then twisting the strand out alright
now<00:00:55.320> take<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.590> tension<00:00:56.070> bar<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> insert<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
now take a tension bar and insert it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.670 
now take a tension bar and insert it
about<00:00:57.329> three<00:00:57.660> feet<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> end<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
about three feet from the end of the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.160 
about three feet from the end of the
fabric<00:00:59.149> we'll<00:01:00.149> hook<00:01:00.270> our<00:01:00.420> stretcher<00:01:00.840> bar<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
fabric we'll hook our stretcher bar to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.280 
fabric we'll hook our stretcher bar to
this<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.910> also<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> temporarily<00:01:03.719> attach<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this I also like to temporarily attach a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
this I also like to temporarily attach a
tension<00:01:04.680> band<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> terminal<00:01:05.610> Pole<00:01:05.820> well

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
tension band to the terminal Pole well

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.560 
tension band to the terminal Pole well
hook<00:01:06.479> I'll<00:01:06.600> come<00:01:06.780> along<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:09.360> hook

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hook I'll come along to this now hook

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.649 
hook I'll come along to this now hook
the<00:01:09.689> stretcher<00:01:10.110> bar<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> tension<00:01:11.189> bar<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
the stretcher bar to the tension bar and

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
the stretcher bar to the tension bar and
hook<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> come-along<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.150> slowly

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
hook the come-along to that and slowly

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.050 
hook the come-along to that and slowly
crank<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> tight<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.290> over<00:01:16.530> tighten

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
crank it tight but don't over tighten

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.490 
crank it tight but don't over tighten
there<00:01:18.060> should<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.330> enough<00:01:18.750> tension<00:01:19.290> so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
there should be just enough tension so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
there should be just enough tension so
you<00:01:19.560> can't<00:01:19.950> squeeze<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> fence<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you can't squeeze the fence with your

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.780 
you can't squeeze the fence with your
fingers<00:01:21.740> once<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> fabric<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.369> tight<00:01:23.580> along

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
fingers once the fabric is tight along

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
fingers once the fabric is tight along
the<00:01:23.850> run<00:01:24.119> pull<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> rest<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> tight

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the run pull the rest of it tight

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.990
