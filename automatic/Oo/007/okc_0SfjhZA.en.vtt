bats quite big edges the middle is
reasonably<00:01:55.890> low<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> reasons<00:01:57.000> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
reasonably low it's when the reasons I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:57.860 
reasonably low it's when the reasons I
like

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
like

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.280 
like
not<00:01:58.870> quite<00:01:59.050> as<00:01:59.140> big<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> middle<00:01:59.800> as<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.920> pod<00:02:01.290> but

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
not quite as big a middle as the pod but

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.080 
not quite as big a middle as the pod but
in<00:02:02.380> my<00:02:02.530> opinion<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.979> say<00:02:03.130> enough<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.820> and

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
in my opinion is say enough there and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.450 
in my opinion is say enough there and
they're<00:02:05.020> slightly<00:02:05.229> lighter<00:02:05.590> than<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.040> pod<00:02:06.280> as

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
they're slightly lighter than the pod as

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.840 
they're slightly lighter than the pod as
well<00:02:07.140> which<00:02:08.140> means<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.890> pickup<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.310> even<00:02:09.729> that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
well which means the pickup is even that

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.800 
well which means the pickup is even that
little<00:02:10.000> bit<00:02:10.209> lighter<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:12.400> again<00:02:13.090> since<00:02:13.540> my

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
little bit lighter which again since my

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.290 
little bit lighter which again since my
