megabyte<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.609> Ram<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.970> still<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
megabyte to be Ram I still get that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.360 
megabyte to be Ram I still get that
still<00:00:31.320> goes<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> same<00:00:31.769> speed<00:00:32.099> though<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.579> um

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
still goes the same speed though and um

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.560
