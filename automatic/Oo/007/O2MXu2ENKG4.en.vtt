00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.160
 It was inaugurated at the agriturismo 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.969
 agririggio rio salso of tavullia in 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.310
 Pesaro 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.500
 at each step the second in shout 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.689
 an experience that of the agricultural nest that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.180
 is becoming increasingly popular in the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.680
 our region is a truly experience 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.269
 important and also marks an evolution 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.630
 of agriculture I think I can say 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.200
 fortunately an agriculture that knows 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.210
 evolve in the bottom of the farm holidays in 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.329
 also energy production fund 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 from renewable sources and now 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.180
 an agriculture that intersects with the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 welfare state with welfare is a great one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 beautiful experience that was born here 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.730
 through the creation of an agrinido 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.649
 thanks also to the commitment of the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.010
 region marche councilor 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 to agriculture that has encouraged 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:11.060
 opening of nursery schools on farms 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 and nest and, moreover, in addition of course 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.009
 to the effectiveness of the project itself 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.390
 same because give the territory of 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.980
 more nurseries that I am absolutely 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 lacking in ours 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.100
 three realities and are special kindergartens 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.290
 in which from the first years of life from one to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.640
 three years there is contact immediately 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.360
 with nature with animals with like 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 say the knowledge also of the processes 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 truly organic since the early days 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 years of life that is something I consider 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.450
 extraordinary for this I am present 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.210
 this inauguration inaugurates if this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.160
 is the second agrinido born in the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.680
 brands but already in the coming weeks is 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.600
 scheduled for the opening and inauguration of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.610
 others attacked in the regional territory 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.190
 I believe that it should be emphasized so 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.800
 absolutely positive and the enterprise 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.420
 agriculture has prepared to this model 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.380
 that the region collaborates brands 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.970
 with montessori foundation and and also with 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.440
 the professional organizations has 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:19.140
 created in a way that makes you win 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.550
 the idea in less than six seven months we have 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.820
 given the commitment of four companies 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.440
 agriculture on this agri-nest project 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.370
 so you go from an experience of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.810
 experimentation to a series of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.540
 experiments and therefore to a network 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.970
 diffused of the agrinido so much so that really 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.400
 to give even more dissemination to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.310
 quality model that exists 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 under the agrinido or the marche region 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.230
 we have created a publication 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.750
 which we will send to all administrations 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.370
 municipal in the region because it is 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.390
 important that it spreads even among the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.900
 institutions 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.540
 this sensitivity towards 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.760
 green ido what kind of activities will come 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.360
 carried out then will be made of 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.910
 activities as natural as possible e 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.310
 so we have the outside garden where 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.810
 there will be sand and a vegetable garden 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.440
 plant the seeds in children 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.140
 then the route will be taken by the animals 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.890
 there is the mill that makes the flour so yes 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.860
 will go and get the flour directly 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.600
 ground from the mill and then it will be done 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.640
 the dough for biscuits the dough for 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.150
 bread, pasta with salt to play 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.590
 inside the nest and then and summer yes 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.310
 they will go to pick up the vegetables 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.870
 directly on the garden there are the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.520
 so if they are going to see the animals 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.980
 pigs will go to see the sheep 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.260
 the donkeys will feed the donkeys 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.280
 and therefore our goal is to 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.050
 do 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.569
 play and make these children feel 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.430
 the most possible immersed in nature is 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.319
 more than anything else to make them feel in 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.599
 family 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.190
 our biggest goal this 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.840
 maximum structure can accommodate twelve 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.520
 but for the moment we have three children 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.500
 or four children enrolled though 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.510
 however, children today have many is 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.710
 already many are asking me there is room 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.020
 we passed then we hope to reach 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.960
 at least seven children for this year 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.479
 it is the importance of contact that children 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.790
 have with the world of nature and gods 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.570
 animals is very important and very 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.220
 important that they are in the open air 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.950
 also because they are always closed 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.479
 inside a room they are always hurting and 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.520
 don't have enough fun 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.259
 they should and therefore it is very important 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.360
 this contact with nature 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.970
 just see what's happening here 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.430
 now that we've brought the animals 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.840
 pigs hens santis the children around 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.340
 so just see what's going on 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.710
 succeeding in tests to understand that one 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.710
 which could certainly work
