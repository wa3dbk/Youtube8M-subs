00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.920
 work for a long time with my

 pokemon team after winning all 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.030
 the medals after winning the high 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.159
 I finally got it I was 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.110
 proud of myself and mixco ki-moon 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.020
 especially my team was formed by 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.750
 an actor star a place and or a salem in a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.630
 mortal match a step tale and my pokemon 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.970
 favorite his hunger I thought the king of 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.979
 world unstoppable but this lasted little 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.950
 time here is where the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.110
 story was a stormy afternoon the day 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.520
 April when I was addressing the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 battlefield because a coach 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.770
 called Charles challenged me easy I said to 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.810
 myself but I was not mistaken I beat 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.729
 all his team with me is abductor 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 Although his team was three 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.569
 pokemon of the electric type this 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.789
 disappointed enough for what I decided 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.860
 make an ultimatum I said that my last 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.929
 battle would take place in a tournament the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.329
 who will win the tournament would face me 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.539
 the months passed and a crowd of 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.000
 coaches signed up for the 152 tournament 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.250
 to be more exact and by the end of 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.649
 registration period the tournament started 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.720
 I went through the first round in this round 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.519
 A coach named 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.470
 sergio who used an ibi he knew 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.750
 attacks that he could not know of 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.150
 no way for example flamethrower or 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.150
 psychic came the semifinals were left 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.190
 four coaches antonio lorena marta 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.170
 and how did the coach not sergio 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.030
 mysterious that he used to pokemon with 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.459
 attacks that can not meet sergio 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.560
 apart from using pokemon with attacks that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.959
 they can not meet he had no mercy with 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.060
 its rivals is even killing the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.040
 pokemon of his rivals I did not want 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.790
 kick him out of the tournament because he wanted me 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.829
 deal 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.290
 I did not care who died, I wanted to 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.269
 that battle the final was between sergio and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 marta a terrible misfortune occurred 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.609
 sergio told him his streak his will 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.609
 dismember, dismember, ask me 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.980
 myself that exists but worst of all 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.870
 I use it against marta your megane and a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.720
 I try to protect it but it did not work 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.030
 they both died and their remains were left 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.739
 scattered across the field to me he gave me 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.170
 like being champion I take away the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.780
 feelings he never had anyone close 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.970
 only my pokemon my ruthless 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.310
 pokemon wanted like a battle 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.409
 hard to win I do not achieve but hopefully 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.840
 I never would have made it at last I could 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.090
 face sergio send my star actor 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.069
 and the command to his life despite all 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.439
 the movements your baby used against 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.659
 my reason could not beat him and the 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.609
 final this raptor shattered the head of 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.980
 ede with a close-up the battle 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.379
 continued he took out a butter free he was 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.510
 too confident in that battle until 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.120
 that super cold or cold polar against me 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.819
 this raptor and once frozen is this 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.069
 raptor fell to the ground and broke into a thousand 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.780
 pieces there was when my anger exploded 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.000
 without thinking twice 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.220
 that is not even his am but I told him to use 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.650
 dot ice without mercy super free left 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.690
 on the floor surrounded by blood but what 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.090
 what happened next was something that 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.220
 I never imagined that sergio got out 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.170
 still remember the battle I destroy the 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.840
 battlefield and I as a coward 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.340
 I ran from there sergio chased me I took 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.239
 to all my pokemon for me 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.190
 protect 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.680
 but one after another they were killed by 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.160
 rai hunt I kept running but I fell to the 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.350
 ground 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.660
 sergio stopped persecuting me a put 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.900
 in front of me he told me you are the great 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.360
 champion a coward like you ha ha ha ha 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.450
 ha ha ha I feel sorry and rage returned 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.280
 I started hitting punches followed not stop 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.710
 for a long time and when I wanted to 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.080
 to give an account I had killed him I started 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.090
 cry now I know that ray will chase me 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.060
 for killing his master now I know that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.250
 it's my end without pokemon without strength now 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.200
 I just have to wait until my death I know that 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.660
 I can not hide forever 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.520
