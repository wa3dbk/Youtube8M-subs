00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
autofocus that this camera has as well

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.680 
autofocus that this camera has as well
so<00:00:47.820> getting<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.329> nice<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.600> close<00:00:49.230> there

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
so getting there nice and close there

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
so getting there nice and close there
you<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.079> focus<00:00:52.559> there<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> goes<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you go to all focus there it goes and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
you go to all focus there it goes and
the<00:00:53.520> autofocus<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.270> nice<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> usually<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the autofocus is very nice is usually a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750 
the autofocus is very nice is usually a
little<00:00:55.289> bit<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:55.500> smoother<00:00:56.010> than<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.190> but

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
little bit more smoother than that but

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.369 
little bit more smoother than that but
you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> autofocus<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:58.020> really

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
you can see here the autofocus is really

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.810 
you can see here the autofocus is really
good<00:00:58.559> once<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.609> in

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
good once you get it right there in

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.010 
good once you get it right there in
focus<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.809> right

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
focus all right

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
focus all right
and<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> webcam<00:01:01.920> has<00:01:02.160> auto<00:01:02.370> focus<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.940> as

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and so the webcam has auto focus here as

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
and so the webcam has auto focus here as
it<00:01:03.149> slowly<00:01:03.510> comes<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> me<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> video

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it slowly comes back to me but the video

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
it slowly comes back to me but the video
calling<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> picture<00:01:06.299> itself<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.990> nice

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
calling the picture itself is very nice

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
calling the picture itself is very nice
