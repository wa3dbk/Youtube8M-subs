00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
on that guy's name wrong safe sir I

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.819 
on that guy's name wrong safe sir I
apologize<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.720> then<00:02:29.989> after<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.290> found<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.799> a

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
apologize and then after I found it a

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.349 
apologize and then after I found it a
bit<00:02:30.859> easy<00:02:31.129> to<00:02:31.340> break<00:02:31.519> him<00:02:31.670> down<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
bit easy to break him down and I

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.369 
bit easy to break him down and I
realized<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.989> take<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.319> bit

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
realized you have to take it a bit

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.770 
realized you have to take it a bit
slower<00:02:33.500> with<00:02:33.980> these<00:02:34.340> bronzes<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.030> there<00:02:35.510> yeah

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
slower with these bronzes and there yeah

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.750 
slower with these bronzes and there yeah
not<00:02:36.409> much<00:02:36.590> slower<00:02:36.890> than<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.189> exercise<00:02:37.609> just

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
not much slower than that exercise just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
not much slower than that exercise just
like<00:02:37.819> walking<00:02:38.180> into<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.629> box<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.049> sliding

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
like walking into the box and sliding

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.259 
like walking into the box and sliding
home<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:39.889> then<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.489> looks<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.819> lot<00:02:40.909> easier<00:02:41.209> than

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269
