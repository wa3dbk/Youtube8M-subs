four inch to hold the sides against the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.149 
four inch to hold the sides against the
base<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.909> then<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.740> didn't<00:01:43.979> come<00:01:44.130> out

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
base and then this one didn't come out

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550 
base and then this one didn't come out
too<00:01:44.430> bad<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.149> only<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:45.960> on

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
too bad the only thing we had was on

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.999 
too bad the only thing we had was on
this<00:01:47.369> side<00:01:49.549> right<00:01:50.780> there<00:01:51.780> below<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.289> second

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this side right there below that second

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
this side right there below that second
screw<00:01:53.220> did<00:01:53.399> split<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.060> had<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> refill<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
screw did split so I had to refill it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.100 
screw did split so I had to refill it
that's<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> only<00:01:55.920> split<00:01:56.539> we<00:01:57.539> pre-drilled

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's the only split we pre-drilled

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.710 
that's the only split we pre-drilled
them<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.679> they<00:01:58.829> wouldn't<00:01:59.549> sweat<00:01:59.970> as<00:02:00.149> many<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
them so they wouldn't sweat as many and

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.230 
them so they wouldn't sweat as many and
the<00:02:01.710> pre-drill<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> two<00:02:02.789> inch<00:02:02.970> ones

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the pre-drill for the two inch ones

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.969 
the pre-drill for the two inch ones
we're<00:02:03.840> using<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:06.420> drill<00:02:06.720> bit<00:02:08.060> which<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
we're using that drill bit which is a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.360 
we're using that drill bit which is a
560<00:02:10.979> force<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.890> don't<00:02:14.069> know<00:02:14.160> what<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
560 force and then I don't know what the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
560 force and then I don't know what the
size<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.209> for<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.720> four<00:02:16.080> inch

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
size of this one is for the four inch

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.440 
size of this one is for the four inch
ones<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.799> side<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.940> we're<00:02:18.060> using<00:02:18.239> that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
ones on the side but we're using that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.809 
ones on the side but we're using that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
four inch screws and these ones are

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.170 
four inch screws and these ones are
really<00:02:23.940> snug<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.799> don't<00:02:25.980> even<00:02:26.250> move<00:02:27.000> at

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
really snug like they don't even move at

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140 
really snug like they don't even move at
all<00:02:28.190> that's<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.849> think<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
all that's just because I think the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.809 
all that's just because I think the
sides<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.599> little<00:02:30.720> bit<00:02:30.959> too<00:02:31.110> far<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.819> our

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
sides are a little bit too far in our

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.729 
sides are a little bit too far in our
cuts<00:02:33.209> might<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.569> been<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.930> barely<00:02:34.110> off<00:02:34.380> but

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
cuts might have been just barely off but

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.819 
cuts might have been just barely off but
uh<00:02:35.390> not<00:02:36.390> too<00:02:36.540> bad<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.049> first<00:02:37.200> more

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
uh not too bad for my first more

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.910 
uh not too bad for my first more
interactive<00:02:38.220> build<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.320> I'll<00:02:40.320> show<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.590> when

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
interactive build so I'll show you when

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.620 
interactive build so I'll show you when
we<00:02:41.040> get<00:02:41.160> them<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.400> finished<00:02:41.760> shootin<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630

next one we're building just letting our

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.170 
next one we're building just letting our
batteries<00:02:45.239> charge<00:02:45.540> because<00:02:45.810> we're<00:02:45.959> using

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
batteries charge because we're using

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.330 
batteries charge because we're using

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
quick it's a few weeks later but I

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.129 
quick it's a few weeks later but I
finally<00:04:11.250> bought<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.730> wood<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:13.910> as<00:04:14.910> for<00:04:15.390> how

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
finally bought the wood and as for how

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:16.909 
finally bought the wood and as for how
they<00:04:16.290> turned<00:04:16.530> out

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
they turned out

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.490 
they turned out
the<00:04:17.070> other<00:04:17.220> ones<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:17.489> up<00:04:17.609> there<00:04:17.900> got<00:04:18.900> five<00:04:19.200> now

tubes<00:04:37.680> are<00:04:37.860> pretty<00:04:38.070> tight<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.520> these<00:04:38.640> they

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
tubes are pretty tight and these they

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.920 
tubes are pretty tight and these they
don't<00:04:39.270> come<00:04:39.450> out<00:04:39.540> very<00:04:39.780> easily<00:04:40.370> but<00:04:41.370> uh<00:04:41.930> that's

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
don't come out very easily but uh that's

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.490 
don't come out very easily but uh that's
because<00:04:43.320> my<00:04:43.710> measurement<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.460> my<00:04:44.639> bottom<00:04:45.500> this

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
because my measurement on my bottom this

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.740 
because my measurement on my bottom this
two<00:04:46.800> by<00:04:46.950> three<00:04:47.220> down<00:04:47.430> there<00:04:47.700> well<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.540> can't

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
two by three down there well you can't

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.200 
two by three down there well you can't
see<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.440> bottom<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:49.950> uh<00:04:49.979> I<00:04:50.340> think<00:04:50.820> mine

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
see it on the bottom but uh I think mine

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.270 
see it on the bottom but uh I think mine
were<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.450> little<00:04:51.660> bit<00:04:51.870> smaller<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
were a little bit smaller and so the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.969 
were a little bit smaller and so the
basis<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:53.940> them<00:04:54.210> are<00:04:54.390> really<00:04:54.600> tight<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.590> I

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
basis of them are really tight and I

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.620 
basis of them are really tight and I
tried<00:04:56.280> chiseling<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:56.970> out<00:04:57.120> but<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.419> was<00:04:57.510> just

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
tried chiseling it out but it was just

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.840 
tried chiseling it out but it was just
too<00:04:57.840> much<00:04:57.960> work<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.830> anyways<00:04:59.160> here<00:04:59.460> they<00:04:59.729> are

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
too much work so anyways here they are

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.020 
too much work so anyways here they are
