you
my<00:02:23.340> definition<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.329> style<00:02:24.719> is<00:02:25.049> having<00:02:25.739> your

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
my definition of style is having your

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.849 
my definition of style is having your
own<00:02:26.040> individuality<00:02:26.999> in<00:02:27.719> making<00:02:28.469> it<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:28.799> own

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
own individuality in making it your own

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.979 
own individuality in making it your own
I<00:02:29.459> do<00:02:29.969> like<00:02:30.749> to<00:02:30.780> read<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.010> read<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.879> on<00:02:33.180> trends

I do like to read and read on on trends

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.149 
I do like to read and read on on trends
and<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:36.299> make<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.599> my<00:02:36.930> own<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.469> that's

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
and I just make it my own and that's

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.839 
and I just make it my own and that's
what<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.450> see<00:02:39.480> with<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.409> lot<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.859> women

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
what I like to see with a lot of women

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.580 
what I like to see with a lot of women
is<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:43.430> their<00:02:44.430> style<00:02:44.969> does<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.959> always<00:02:46.230> help

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
is that their style does not always help

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
is that their style does not always help
to<00:02:46.680> revolve<00:02:47.069> around<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.639> thing<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.299> that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to revolve around one thing is just that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.679 
to revolve around one thing is just that
their<00:02:49.079> individuality<00:02:49.680> shows<00:02:50.219> through<00:02:50.689> that

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
their individuality shows through that

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.220 
their individuality shows through that
style<00:02:52.169> so<00:02:52.469> that's<00:02:52.709> my<00:02:52.919> definition<00:02:53.219> of<00:02:54.230> style

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
style so that's my definition of style

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
style so that's my definition of style
when<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.889> it<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:56.969> own
