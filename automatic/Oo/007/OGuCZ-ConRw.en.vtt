00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
you love the company why don't you you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.590 
you love the company why don't you you
know<00:02:10.280> start<00:02:10.520> sharing<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.240> you're<00:02:11.360> actually

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
know start sharing it you're actually

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.510 
know start sharing it you're actually
being<00:02:11.780> really<00:02:12.140> selfish<00:02:12.590> by<00:02:12.800> not<00:02:12.980> sharing<00:02:13.190> it

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
being really selfish by not sharing it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.610 
being really selfish by not sharing it
and<00:02:13.670> no<00:02:14.540> one<00:02:14.690> likes<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.020> be<00:02:15.260> told<00:02:15.470> they're

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and no one likes to be told they're

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.740 
and no one likes to be told they're
selfish<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.400> that's<00:02:16.790> exactly<00:02:17.240> what<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> did<00:02:17.630> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
selfish so that's exactly what I did and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.090 
selfish so that's exactly what I did and
I<00:02:17.840> started<00:02:18.200> sharing<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:18.740> more<00:02:18.890> people

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
I started sharing that with more people

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.830 
I started sharing that with more people
so<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:19.790> guess<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> foundation<00:02:20.630> for<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
so I guess the foundation for the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.350 
so I guess the foundation for the
business<00:02:21.170> was<00:02:21.500> launch<00:02:21.980> parties<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.730> held<00:02:23.240> my

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
business was launch parties I held my

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.650 
business was launch parties I held my
first<00:02:23.630> one<00:02:23.870> we<00:02:24.080> had<00:02:24.200> six<00:02:24.440> people<00:02:24.590> attend<00:02:25.100> and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
first one we had six people attend and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.510 
first one we had six people attend and
all<00:02:26.660> those<00:02:26.960> six<00:02:27.200> people<00:02:27.500> signed<00:02:27.770> up<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.250> was

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
all those six people signed up and I was

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.130 
all those six people signed up and I was
just<00:02:28.820> gobsmacked<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.540> couldn't<00:02:29.810> believe<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
just gobsmacked I couldn't believe it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
just gobsmacked I couldn't believe it
and<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.980> straight<00:02:31.400> after<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.940> next

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
and then straight after that the next

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.600 
and then straight after that the next
day<00:02:32.300> we<00:02:32.330> held<00:02:32.660> another<00:02:32.750> launch<00:02:33.170> party<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.920> it

day we held another launch party so it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.180 
day we held another launch party so it
came<00:02:35.150> down<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.720> doing<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.650> lot<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.860> personal

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
came down to doing a lot of personal

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.250 
came down to doing a lot of personal
development<00:02:37.280> work<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:38.120> do<00:02:38.390> believe<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.930> that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
development work I do believe that that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.810 
development work I do believe that that
is<00:02:39.440> what<00:02:39.470> helped<00:02:40.400> me<00:02:40.520> with<00:02:40.640> my<00:02:40.670> leadership
