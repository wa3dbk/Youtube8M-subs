00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
through a geyser essentially up through

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.660 
through a geyser essentially up through
the<00:01:54.289> bed<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.590> East<00:01:54.770> River<00:01:54.979> yeah<00:01:55.340> they<00:01:55.579> were

River<00:01:57.799> we<00:01:58.789> did<00:01:58.969> one<00:01:59.209> on<00:01:59.240> how<00:01:59.959> subways<00:02:00.409> work<00:02:00.590> we

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
River we did one on how subways work we

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.529 
River we did one on how subways work we
did<00:02:00.889> a<00:02:00.920> podcast<00:02:01.340> episode<00:02:01.729> because<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.270> good<00:02:02.420> one

and<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:02.780> talked<00:02:02.990> about<00:02:03.079> this<00:02:03.350> kind<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.679> thing

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889 
and it talked about this kind of thing

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.249 
and it talked about this kind of thing
when<00:02:04.729> you're<00:02:04.880> digging<00:02:05.209> a<00:02:05.299> tunnel<00:02:05.479> underneath

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
when you're digging a tunnel underneath

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.139 
when you're digging a tunnel underneath
the<00:02:06.469> river<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:06.979> have<00:02:07.039> to<00:02:07.249> pressurize<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:07.789> or

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
the river you have to pressurize it or

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.880 
the river you have to pressurize it or
else<00:02:08.300> everybody's<00:02:08.720> getting<00:02:08.990> get<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.350> bender

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
else everybody's getting get the bender

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.640 
else everybody's getting get the bender
and<00:02:10.069> die<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:11.150> they<00:02:11.330> had<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.660> compressed<00:02:12.440> air

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
and die so they had this compressed air

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.680 
and die so they had this compressed air
going<00:02:13.010> into<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> tunnel<00:02:13.790> well<00:02:14.300> apparently

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
going into the tunnel well apparently

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.290 
going into the tunnel well apparently
there<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.080> crack<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:16.100> went<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.580> through

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
there was a crack that went up through

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.660 
there was a crack that went up through
the<00:02:17.450> riverbed<00:02:17.930> yeah<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.830> difference<00:02:19.520> in

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the riverbed yeah and the difference in

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.809 
the riverbed yeah and the difference in
pressure<00:02:20.140> pushed<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.319> compressed<00:02:21.860> air<00:02:22.099> up

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
pressure pushed this compressed air up

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.960 
pressure pushed this compressed air up
into<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.450> yeah<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.989> sucked<00:02:24.830> them<00:02:25.310> workers<00:02:25.819> who

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
into it yeah and sucked them workers who

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.570 
into it yeah and sucked them workers who
were<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.209> there

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
were in there

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.270 
were in there
through<00:02:26.850> an<00:02:27.120> 18-inch<00:02:28.020> hole<00:02:28.320> yeah<00:02:28.680> three<00:02:28.980> dudes

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
through an 18-inch hole yeah three dudes

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.970 
through an 18-inch hole yeah three dudes
yeah<00:02:29.880> two<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.240> them<00:02:30.480> died<00:02:30.690> yep<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.560> one<00:02:31.860> of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
yeah two of them died yep and one of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.550 
yeah two of them died yep and one of
them<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.400> how<00:02:32.550> far<00:02:32.760> did<00:02:32.910> he<00:02:33.030> go<00:02:33.230> 300<00:02:34.230> yards

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
them I think how far did he go 300 yards

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.280 
them I think how far did he go 300 yards
yeah<00:02:34.800> 200<00:02:35.280> yards<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.820> like<00:02:36.030> 21<00:02:36.570> feet<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
yeah 200 yards in like 21 feet up in the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.600 
yeah 200 yards in like 21 feet up in the
air

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
air

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.430 
air

underneath the river through the
riverbed<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:43.380> through<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> river

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
riverbed up through the river

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.010 
riverbed up through the river
yeah<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.640> into<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> air<00:02:45.090> that's<00:02:45.840> what

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020

not 1916 for some overtime it's all

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.670 
not 1916 for some overtime it's all
about<00:03:50.790> historical<00:03:51.420> context<00:03:52.020> right<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.530> that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
about historical context right so that

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.740 
about historical context right so that
was<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.860> good<00:03:52.980> one<00:03:53.130> nice<00:03:53.670> job<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.060> tell<00:03:54.630> us

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
was a good one nice job on that tell us

was a good one nice job on that tell us
how<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:55.050> feels<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.770> in<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.040> geyser<00:03:56.660> that's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
how it feels to go up in a geyser that's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.770 
how it feels to go up in a geyser that's
the<00:03:57.870> title<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.239> recommend<00:04:00.570> just

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
the title of that and I recommend just

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.420 
the title of that and I recommend just
going<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> New<00:04:01.440> York<00:04:01.470> Times<00:04:01.650> archive<00:04:02.250> and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
going to the New York Times archive and

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.470 
going to the New York Times archive and
just<00:04:02.610> reading<00:04:02.820> how<00:04:03.030> things<00:04:03.239> were<00:04:03.360> written

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
just reading how things were written

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.870 
just reading how things were written
back<00:04:03.720> then<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:04.410> pretty<00:04:04.590> fun<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.220> because

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
back then it's pretty fun it is because

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
they have typically scans in PDF form

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.390 
they have typically scans in PDF form

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
Eurasia from charles choi this is kind

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.370 
Eurasia from charles choi this is kind
of<00:04:26.400> neat<00:04:26.580> what<00:04:27.030> they<00:04:27.150> found<00:04:27.390> when<00:04:27.720> they<00:04:27.870> in

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
of neat what they found when they in

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.860 
of neat what they found when they in
2010<00:04:29.070> they<00:04:29.220> did<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.460> first<00:04:29.669> sequence<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
2010 they did the first sequence of the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.050 
2010 they did the first sequence of the
neanderthal<00:04:31.410> genome<00:04:31.440> which<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.430> really<00:04:32.880> cool

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
neanderthal genome which is really cool

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.960 
neanderthal genome which is really cool
because<00:04:33.180> they<00:04:33.419> found<00:04:33.660> out<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.970> modern

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
because they found out that modern

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.820 
because they found out that modern
Eurasian<00:04:36.600> share<00:04:36.870> about<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.289> to<00:04:37.440> four<00:04:37.590> percent

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
Eurasian share about one to four percent

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.189 
Eurasian share about one to four percent
of<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.850> Neanderthal<00:04:39.360> DNA

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
of the Neanderthal DNA

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.379 
of the Neanderthal DNA
right<00:04:40.620> which<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:40.979> itself<00:04:41.249> is<00:04:41.430> pretty<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:42.029> pretty

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
right which in itself is pretty a pretty

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.230 
right which in itself is pretty a pretty
big<00:04:42.659> finding<00:04:43.080> right<00:04:43.680> but<00:04:44.520> then<00:04:44.729> they<00:04:44.999> said

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
big finding right but then they said

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.450 
big finding right but then they said
wait<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.990> minute<00:04:46.020> modern<00:04:46.560> humans<00:04:46.919> also<00:04:47.099> lived

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
wait a minute modern humans also lived

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.850 
wait a minute modern humans also lived
on<00:04:47.639> this<00:04:47.759> planet<00:04:48.419> at<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.539> same<00:04:48.719> time<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.469> wonder

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
on this planet at the same time I wonder

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.459 
on this planet at the same time I wonder
if<00:04:49.949> they<00:04:50.039> ever<00:04:50.449> copulated<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.719> they<00:04:51.990> did<00:04:52.169> they

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
if they ever copulated and they did they

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.529 
if they ever copulated and they did they
definitely<00:04:52.740> did<00:04:53.039> so<00:04:53.279> Neanderthals<00:04:54.210> had

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
definitely did so Neanderthals had

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.499 
definitely did so Neanderthals had
humans<00:04:55.139> beat<00:04:55.349> by<00:04:55.560> about<00:04:55.860> 30<00:04:56.279> or<00:04:56.460> 40,000<00:04:57.240> years

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
humans beat by about 30 or 40,000 years

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.290 
humans beat by about 30 or 40,000 years
and<00:04:58.080> they<00:04:58.289> coexisted<00:04:58.919> for<00:04:58.979> about<00:04:59.300> 200,000

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
and they coexisted for about 200,000

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.059 
and they coexisted for about 200,000
years<00:05:00.360> or<00:05:00.710> 170,000<00:05:01.710> years

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
years or 170,000 years

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.559 
years or 170,000 years
plenty<00:05:02.279> of<00:05:02.310> time<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.580> get<00:05:02.939> down<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.150> business

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
plenty of time to get down to business

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.749 
plenty of time to get down to business
well<00:05:03.779> yeah<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.259> then<00:05:04.499> the<00:05:04.620> Endor<00:05:04.860> Thals<00:05:05.099> died

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
well yeah and then the Endor Thals died

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.179 
well yeah and then the Endor Thals died
out<00:05:05.969> about<00:05:06.240> 30,000<00:05:07.110> years<00:05:07.319> ago<00:05:07.409> and<00:05:07.889> they're

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
out about 30,000 years ago and they're

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.890 
out about 30,000 years ago and they're
still<00:05:08.400> trying<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.639> figure<00:05:08.849> out<00:05:08.999> what<00:05:09.210> happened

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
still trying to figure out what happened

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.110 
still trying to figure out what happened
or<00:05:10.080> why<00:05:10.289> was<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:10.740> competition<00:05:11.460> was<00:05:11.699> it<00:05:11.819> war

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
or why was it competition was it war

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.999 
or why was it competition was it war
right<00:05:13.339> who<00:05:14.339> knows<00:05:14.580> but<00:05:14.969> it<00:05:15.330> was<00:05:15.479> a<00:05:15.509> fairly

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
right who knows but it was a fairly

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.040 
right who knows but it was a fairly
surprising<00:05:17.009> find<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.580> find<00:05:17.759> out<00:05:17.909> that<00:05:18.089> you<00:05:18.629> me

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
surprising find to find out that you me

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.899 
surprising find to find out that you me
pretty<00:05:19.710> much<00:05:19.889> everybody<00:05:20.310> in<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:20.550> room<00:05:20.729> right

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
pretty much everybody in this room right

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.829 
pretty much everybody in this room right
now<00:05:20.969> has<00:05:22.639> Neanderthal<00:05:23.639> DNA<00:05:23.819> and<00:05:24.419> not<00:05:24.659> just

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:24.839 
now has Neanderthal DNA and not just

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.800 
now has Neanderthal DNA and not just
neanderthal<00:05:25.469> yeah<00:05:25.830> but<00:05:26.129> also<00:05:26.810> Denisovan

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
neanderthal yeah but also Denisovan

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.700 
neanderthal yeah but also Denisovan
which<00:05:28.560> is<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.740> new<00:05:28.979> kind<00:05:29.189> of<00:05:29.430> humanoid<00:05:30.710> hominid

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
which is a new kind of humanoid hominid

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.829 
which is a new kind of humanoid hominid
I<00:05:31.830> think<00:05:32.099> is<00:05:32.249> the<00:05:32.460> more<00:05:32.819> accepted<00:05:33.300> scientific

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
I think is the more accepted scientific

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.079 
I think is the more accepted scientific
term<00:05:34.020> okay<00:05:34.620> humanoid<00:05:35.310> is<00:05:35.430> more<00:05:35.610> science

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
term okay humanoid is more science

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.179 
term okay humanoid is more science
fiction<00:05:36.330> we're<00:05:36.689> talking<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.229> paleo<00:05:37.680> history

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
fiction we're talking like paleo history

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.779 
fiction we're talking like paleo history
yeah<00:05:38.400> hominid<00:05:38.849> and<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:40.110> at<00:05:40.740> least<00:05:41.039> a<00:05:41.520> couple

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
yeah hominid and the at least a couple

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.249 
yeah hominid and the at least a couple
other<00:05:42.060> types<00:05:42.389> as<00:05:42.569> well<00:05:42.689> but<00:05:42.960> what<00:05:43.110> they're

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
other types as well but what they're

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.589 
other types as well but what they're
trying<00:05:43.469> to<00:05:43.499> figure<00:05:43.650> out<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:43.949> like<00:05:44.099> why<00:05:44.419> why<00:05:45.419> did

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
trying to figure out is like why why did

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.889 
trying to figure out is like why why did
we<00:05:45.779> stop<00:05:46.139> when<00:05:46.830> humans<00:05:47.370> reached<00:05:47.639> Eurasia<00:05:48.120> yeah

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:48.899 
we stop when humans reached Eurasia yeah

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.600 
we stop when humans reached Eurasia yeah
and<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.289> other<00:05:49.319> interesting<00:05:49.710> find<00:05:50.129> here<00:05:50.460> is

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
and the other interesting find here is

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.369 
and the other interesting find here is
that<00:05:51.620> we<00:05:52.620> share<00:05:52.800> more<00:05:53.039> DNA<00:05:53.310> than<00:05:54.379> the

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
that we share more DNA than the

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.679 
that we share more DNA than the
Neanderthals<00:05:55.889> in<00:05:56.219> Africa<00:05:56.789> right<00:05:57.389> just<00:05:57.569> kind

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
Neanderthals in Africa right just kind

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.389 
Neanderthals in Africa right just kind
of<00:05:57.779> reverses<00:05:58.229> of<00:05:58.379> how<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.740> would<00:05:58.949> think<00:05:59.129> and

00:05:59.389 --> 00:05:59.399 
of reverses of how you would think and

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.820 
of reverses of how you would think and
the<00:06:00.000> theory<00:06:00.330> is<00:06:00.360> is<00:06:00.659> that<00:06:00.899> they<00:06:01.289> maybe<00:06:01.680> just

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
the theory is is that they maybe just

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.070 
the theory is is that they maybe just
started<00:06:02.370> copulating<00:06:03.120> once<00:06:03.300> they<00:06:03.449> left<00:06:03.659> Africa

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
started copulating once they left Africa

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.139 
started copulating once they left Africa
right<00:06:04.649> or<00:06:05.219> you<00:06:05.460> know<00:06:05.550> some<00:06:05.759> of<00:06:05.789> them<00:06:05.939> did<00:06:06.120> not

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.149 
right or you know some of them did not

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:10.610 
right or you know some of them did not
entirely<00:06:07.159> or<00:06:08.159> they<00:06:08.759> it<00:06:09.029> was<00:06:09.210> they<00:06:10.020> diverged

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
entirely or they it was they diverged

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.429 
entirely or they it was they diverged
and<00:06:11.330> recombined<00:06:12.330> in<00:06:12.659> Africa<00:06:13.139> and<00:06:13.199> we're<00:06:13.319> just

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
and recombined in Africa and we're just

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.950 
and recombined in Africa and we're just
so<00:06:13.589> different<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.819> that's<00:06:15.509> how<00:06:15.629> it<00:06:15.749> shows<00:06:15.899> up

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
so different that that's how it shows up

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.980 
so different that that's how it shows up
so<00:06:16.279> which<00:06:17.279> is<00:06:17.430> called<00:06:17.669> a<00:06:17.819> speciation<00:06:18.389> event

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
so which is called a speciation event

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.670 
so which is called a speciation event
when<00:06:19.710> two<00:06:20.520> formerly<00:06:21.120> similar<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.439> same

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
when two formerly similar the same

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.659 
when two formerly similar the same
species<00:06:23.009> have<00:06:23.729> gotten<00:06:24.149> so<00:06:24.839> far<00:06:25.080> off<00:06:25.399> the<00:06:26.399> same

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
species have gotten so far off the same

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.119 
species have gotten so far off the same
path<00:06:26.999> that<00:06:27.659> they<00:06:27.870> can't<00:06:28.139> reproduce<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:29.039> any

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
path that they can't reproduce that any

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:30.980 
path that they can't reproduce that any
longer<00:06:29.339> yeah<00:06:29.879> we<00:06:30.149> did<00:06:30.300> an<00:06:30.419> episode<00:06:30.539> on<00:06:30.839> that

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
longer yeah we did an episode on that

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.200 
longer yeah we did an episode on that
too<00:06:31.349> didn't<00:06:31.560> we<00:06:31.680> evolution<00:06:32.399> and<00:06:32.550> isolation<00:06:32.669> or

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
too didn't we evolution and isolation or

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.689 
too didn't we evolution and isolation or
something<00:06:33.479> like<00:06:33.569> that<00:06:33.629> yeah<00:06:33.960> yeah<00:06:34.699> speciation

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
something like that yeah yeah speciation

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.429 
something like that yeah yeah speciation
event<00:06:36.210> it's<00:06:36.509> all<00:06:36.569> coming<00:06:36.990> back

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:37.439 
event it's all coming back

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.499 
event it's all coming back
so<00:06:37.949> I<00:06:37.979> thanks<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.639> live<00:06:38.789> science<00:06:39.300> and

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
yeah that one's called humans broke off

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.459 
yeah that one's called humans broke off
Neanderthal<00:06:45.149> sex<00:06:45.449> after<00:06:45.779> discovering<00:06:46.289> new
