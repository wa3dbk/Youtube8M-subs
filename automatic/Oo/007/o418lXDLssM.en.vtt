from<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> planet<00:01:40.560> Krypton<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
from the planet Krypton so I really

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.600 
from the planet Krypton so I really

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
think that all the kind of human element

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
think that all the kind of human element
and<00:01:44.850> character<00:01:45.420> development<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:46.049> all

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and character development that's all

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.870 
and character development that's all
really<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.250> where<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.579> movie

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880

was<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.490> beginning<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.090> see

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
was right at the beginning when we see

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
was right at the beginning when we see
what<00:01:52.079> planet<00:01:52.500> Krypton<00:01:52.860> looks<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.520> mean<00:01:53.640> it
