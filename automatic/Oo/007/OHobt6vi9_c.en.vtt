00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 safe than sorry is worth more 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 prevent what to remedy 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.710
 Caution is never too much, you already tired of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.620
 listen to all this then it's time to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.070
 put into practice now begins the 100% 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.070
 sure a 100% program for you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.629
 today we will talk about men and machines in the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.700
 track how to operate the larger vehicles 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.980
 safety care that can not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 to go blank on the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 importance of maintenance and transportation 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.620
 Roller Drilling Machines 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.719
 Roller excavator shovel loader 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.059
 the machines even came to help 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.000
 thanks to them great works are made 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.649
 with more savings and less time but for 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.110
 no accident of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 the safety rules must be 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.650
 be followed 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 let's check out a work 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.240
 pressing any button needs to be 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.259
 qualified and is in good 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.850
 illuminated 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.150
 he must undergo a new training 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 if you get new machine on the piece and use 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.710
 always a badge with a photo of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 identification so no one gets hurt 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.720
 all moving parts must have 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.820
 appropriate protections the same thing is worth 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.460
 if it has the possibility of parts or 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.470
 particles to be released on or 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.869
 turning off a machine must be a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.610
 easy task but measures should be 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.899
 taken so that this does not happen 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.329
 involuntary form 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.579
 the locking device prevents the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.100
 operation by unauthorized person 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.320
 now the starting devices 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.630
 drive and stop want to be 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.439
 designed in areas outside of the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 Danger 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.090
 in a place that prevents the drive from 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.890
 accidental disconnection by the operator or 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.689
 any other person 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 in case of emergency or other 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.540
 should be able to interrupt the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.540
 operation from here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.580
 before placing a machine to 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.200
 to function 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 read the manual supplied by the manufacturer 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 and follow step by step all the indications 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.819
 and working procedures and 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.769
 safety measures taken from the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.780
 risk analysis but will not fail to 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.780
 outside the collective protection measures 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.569
 machinery equipment facilities and everything 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.730
 need safety signs for 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.390
 to alert workers and whoever is 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.489
 close 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.739
 warnings show the dangers to which they are 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.080
 operating instructions and 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.599
 maintenance information to ensure 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.790
 health of the world and not to pass 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.640
 unnoticed can abuse colors 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.500
 the parties with the highest risk of 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.970
 accident won registrations in Portuguese 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.130
 always legible 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.370
 be creative do not just use the word 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.630
 danger light beeps leaves a 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.269
 worker on alert 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.519
 if necessary, display devices 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.750
 quantitative and qualitative reading 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.750
 must be installed 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.920
 transport machinery and vehicles 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.640
 need preventive maintenance and 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.400
 corrective 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.220
 with date marked by the manufacturer remember 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.380
 if you follow official technical standards 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.780
 in force in the absence of them 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.590
 international standards and expression 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.300
 repairs and cleaning maintenance and adjustments 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.250
 all this can only be done by 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.190
 qualified professionals 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.860
 or legally qualified and will need 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.930
 formal authorization of the employer but 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.970
 when to put your hand in the dough 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.890
 the equipment is stopped keep your eye on 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.740
 mainly on the brake and steering 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.830
 electrical system and traction cable and 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.480
 suspension when necessary tests 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.790
 non-destructive parts that are 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.950
 subjected to too much force wear them 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.320
 can an accident happen 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.790
 inspections should be recorded in 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.520
 specific document 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.220
 note there what can not miss the dates 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.490
 failures found preventive measures 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.890
 adopted and also the indication of person 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.100
 technician or qualified company that 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.100
 service 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.230
 the car that must be authorized by the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.890
 department of roads and taxi 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.750
 state 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.280
 it needs to be standardized and 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.230
 authenticated to travel 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.540
 it shall state its period of 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.370
 validity of the itineraries and 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.170
 round trip and the amount of 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.300
 workers to be transported 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.460
 Ask the driver if he is 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.170
 qualified in the d block category and 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.480
 verify that it has a certificate of 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.000
 training to conduct transportation 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.920
 collective passenger but will not 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.950
 do this with the car moving in 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.020
 ready to board to operate a 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.080
 This machine only has the qualification 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.820
 and if you get new machine you will need 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.560
 undergo training 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.840
 the working procedures of 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.410
 must be followed at the foot of the 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.590
 letter 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.810
 they are all in the manufacturer's manual 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.930
 reflective vests plaques and worker 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.490
 help to make the signaling 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.410
 it is important to let the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.720
 car or truck drivers 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.580
 the machines need cleaning and 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.800
 inspection and maintenance 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.710
 keep an eye on the brake and steering system 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.680
 and traction and suspension cables 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.990
 following step by step 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:41.990
 everyone is protected 500 beds without
