bring<00:00:50.479> up<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.780> UV<00:00:51.019> unwrapping<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.909> for<00:00:52.909> the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
bring up the UV unwrapping and for the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.850 
bring up the UV unwrapping and for the
cube<00:00:53.239> we<00:00:53.900> could<00:00:54.199> do<00:00:54.379> unwrap<00:00:56.559> let<00:00:57.559> me<00:00:57.650> show<00:00:57.799> you

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
cube we could do unwrap let me show you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.429 
cube we could do unwrap let me show you
an<00:00:58.129> example<00:00:58.280> here<00:00:58.720> alright<00:00:59.720> so<00:00:59.900> go<00:01:00.140> down<00:01:00.170> to

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
review let's gather the reddit results

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.810 
review let's gather the reddit results
now<00:01:14.719> if<00:01:15.170> we<00:01:15.380> were<00:01:15.469> to<00:01:15.500> unwrap<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.670> do

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
now if we were to unwrap it and just do

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.929 
now if we were to unwrap it and just do
a<00:01:17.270> regular<00:01:17.600> unwrap<00:01:18.049> it<00:01:18.320> would<00:01:18.799> just<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.280> wrap

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
a regular unwrap it would just a wrap

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.639 
a regular unwrap it would just a wrap
each<00:01:20.149> face<00:01:20.390> basically<00:01:20.869> an<00:01:21.079> overlapping<00:01:21.499> on

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
each face basically an overlapping on

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.649 
each face basically an overlapping on
top<00:01:21.859> of<00:01:22.009> each<00:01:22.100> other<00:01:22.249> which<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.119> not<00:01:23.420> something

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
top of each other which is not something

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.069 
top of each other which is not something
we<00:01:23.840> want<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:27.170> could<00:01:27.289> see<00:01:27.499> this<00:01:27.679> here<00:01:29.079> while

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
we want you could see this here while

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.760 
we want you could see this here while
this<00:01:30.259> would<00:01:30.439> work<00:01:30.590> fine<00:01:30.920> for<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.310> cube

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
this would work fine for the cube

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.349 
this would work fine for the cube
another<00:01:33.770> method<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.249> can<00:01:34.399> use<00:01:34.579> is<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:34.969> smart

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
another method you can use is the smart

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.120 
another method you can use is the smart
TV<00:01:35.479> project<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.530> can<00:01:36.560> just<00:01:36.859> leave<00:01:37.009> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
TV project and you can just leave the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.919 
TV project and you can just leave the
settings<00:01:37.429> at<00:01:37.549> default<00:01:37.670> we'll<00:01:38.539> cover<00:01:38.719> those

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
settings at default we'll cover those

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.050 
settings at default we'll cover those
also<00:01:39.259> in<00:01:39.469> a<00:01:39.530> later<00:01:39.679> tutorial<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:40.880> said

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
also in a later tutorial and you said

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.550 
also in a later tutorial and you said
okay<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.950> now<00:01:42.950> you'll<00:01:43.130> see<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.369> each<00:01:44.560> face

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
okay and now you'll see that each face

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.359 
okay and now you'll see that each face
has<00:01:46.249> been<00:01:46.399> unwrapped<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:48.740> can<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.100> in

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
has been unwrapped and you can see in

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.830 
has been unwrapped and you can see in
the<00:01:49.490> 3d<00:01:49.609> viewport<00:01:50.149> which<00:01:50.389> one<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.630> have

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
the 3d viewport which one I have

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.209 
the 3d viewport which one I have
selected<00:01:53.409> all<00:01:54.409> right<00:01:54.560> now<00:01:56.499> just<00:01:57.499> like<00:01:57.710> inside

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
selected all right now just like inside

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.749 
selected all right now just like inside
of<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:59.509> 3d<00:01:59.840> viewport<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.950> can<00:02:01.130> scale<00:02:01.429> by

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
of the 3d viewport you can scale by

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.349 
of the 3d viewport you can scale by
hitting<00:02:01.909> s<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.959> give<00:02:03.139> it<00:02:03.259> more<00:02:04.060> space<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.240> the

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
hitting s to give it more space on the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.219 
hitting s to give it more space on the
texture<00:02:05.719> sheet<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.969> G<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.270> move<00:02:09.110> it

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
texture sheet you can it G to move it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.700 
texture sheet you can it G to move it
around<00:02:09.319> which<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.220> grabbed<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:11.230> are<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.530> can

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
around which is grabbed and are you can

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.060 
around which is grabbed and are you can
rotate<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.190> face<00:02:14.350> later<00:02:15.350> this<00:02:15.500> or<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.710> plan<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
rotate the face later this or I plan to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.650 
rotate the face later this or I plan to
show<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.370> how<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.460> create<00:02:16.760> texture<00:02:17.210> atlases

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
show you how to create texture atlases

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.220 
show you how to create texture atlases
inside

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
inside

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.130 
inside
blender<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:20.000> that's<00:02:20.569> where<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.050> will

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
blender and and that's where it will

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.410 
blender and and that's where it will
actually<00:02:21.319> cover<00:02:21.800> more<00:02:22.549> useful<00:02:22.970> means<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
actually cover more useful means of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.910 
actually cover more useful means of
moving<00:02:23.870> around<00:02:23.959> however<00:02:24.319> for<00:02:24.620> now<00:02:24.709> we're<00:02:24.890> just

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
moving around however for now we're just

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.530 
moving around however for now we're just
gonna<00:02:25.159> keep<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.519> at<00:02:25.640> default<00:02:25.819> okay<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:28.540> now

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
gonna keep it at default okay so now

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.880 
gonna keep it at default okay so now
we're<00:02:30.140> gonna<00:02:30.260> go<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.680> V's<00:02:32.590> export<00:02:33.590> UV

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
we're gonna go to you V's export UV

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.490 
we're gonna go to you V's export UV
layout<00:02:34.750> we're<00:02:35.750> gonna<00:02:35.930> dump<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.379> our

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
layout we're gonna dump it on our

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.869 
layout we're gonna dump it on our
desktop<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.269> I'm<00:02:38.269> just<00:02:38.540> gonna<00:02:38.629> call<00:02:38.959> this

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
desktop and I'm just gonna call this

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:49.720 
desktop and I'm just gonna call this
texture<00:02:40.879> dot<00:02:41.269> PNG<00:02:42.549> export<00:02:43.549> AV<00:02:43.819> layout<00:02:48.370> okay

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
texture dot PNG export AV layout okay

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.809 
texture dot PNG export AV layout okay
so<00:02:50.980> now<00:02:51.980> we're<00:02:52.129> gonna<00:02:52.220> go<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.430> GIMP<00:02:52.730> file<00:02:53.739> open

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
so now we're gonna go to GIMP file open

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.729 
so now we're gonna go to GIMP file open
desktop<00:02:56.230> texture<00:02:57.230> PNG<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.670> by<00:02:58.819> default<00:02:59.060> it's

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
desktop texture PNG and by default it's

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.599 
desktop texture PNG and by default it's
1024<00:03:00.739> by<00:03:00.890> 1024<00:03:02.590> before<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:03.680> go<00:03:03.769> any<00:03:03.950> further<00:03:04.129> if

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
1024 by 1024 before we go any further if

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.449 
1024 by 1024 before we go any further if
you<00:03:05.299> were<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.480> click<00:03:05.599> new<00:03:05.930> right<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:07.310> can

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
you were to click new right here you can

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.490 
you were to click new right here you can
give<00:03:07.609> your<00:03:07.910> new<00:03:08.180> image<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.540> name<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.319> could

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
give your new image a name and you could

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.710 
give your new image a name and you could
define<00:03:09.859> how<00:03:10.790> big<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.090> want<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.299> texture<00:03:11.629> to

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
define how big you want the texture to

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.869 
define how big you want the texture to
be<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:12.019> you<00:03:12.140> could<00:03:12.319> export<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.920> out<00:03:12.980> however

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
be and you could export that out however

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.240 
be and you could export that out however
for<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.299> sake<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.690> tutorial<00:03:15.250> should

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
for the sake of this tutorial should

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.289 
for the sake of this tutorial should
have<00:03:16.370> explained<00:03:16.609> this<00:03:16.760> first<00:03:17.000> we're<00:03:17.269> just

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
have explained this first we're just

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.229 
have explained this first we're just
using<00:03:17.569> everything<00:03:17.900> at<00:03:18.109> default<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.209> a

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
using everything at default so we have a

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.159 
using everything at default so we have a
1,024<00:03:21.079> texture<00:03:21.579> alright<00:03:22.579> so<00:03:23.269> let's<00:03:23.720> see<00:03:23.930> one

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
1,024 texture alright so let's see one

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.479 
1,024 texture alright so let's see one
of<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.349> faces<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:24.859> I'm<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.069> gonna<00:03:25.190> write

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
of the faces here I'm just gonna write

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.809 
of the faces here I'm just gonna write
high<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.220> we're<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.430> going<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.669> bother

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
high and we're not going to bother

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.599 
high and we're not going to bother
making<00:03:29.269> this<00:03:29.359> all<00:03:29.569> fancy<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:31.340> then<00:03:31.459> I'm<00:03:31.519> gonna

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
making this all fancy and then I'm gonna

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.930 
making this all fancy and then I'm gonna
use<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.910> bucket<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.510> pattern<00:03:32.840> fill<00:03:33.139> and<00:03:33.940> I'm

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
use the bucket the pattern fill and I'm

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.640 
use the bucket the pattern fill and I'm
just<00:03:35.150> going<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.389> randomly<00:03:35.660> fill<00:03:36.169> this<00:03:36.290> up<00:03:36.470> with

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
just going to randomly fill this up with

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.970 
just going to randomly fill this up with
random<00:03:37.099> patterns<00:03:40.060> found<00:03:41.060> inside<00:03:41.599> of<00:03:41.980> well

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
random patterns found inside of well

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.039 
random patterns found inside of well
either<00:03:43.099> given<00:03:43.519> inside<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.880> blender<00:03:45.430> ok<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.930> now

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
either given inside of blender ok so now

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.780 
either given inside of blender ok so now
we're<00:03:48.290> gonna<00:03:48.380> do<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> file<00:03:48.950> save<00:03:50.169> and<00:03:51.790> our

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
we're gonna do a file save and our

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.759 
we're gonna do a file save and our
texture<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.239> saved<00:03:53.450> now<00:03:53.660> there<00:03:54.319> are<00:03:54.440> two<00:03:54.739> ways

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
texture is saved now there are two ways

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.720 
texture is saved now there are two ways
to<00:03:55.310> view<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.680> first<00:03:57.919> one<00:03:58.099> which<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.489> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
to view this the first one which is the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.860 
to view this the first one which is the
default<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.150> we're<00:03:59.359> going<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.540> cover<00:03:59.690> his

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
default one we're going to cover his

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.729 
default one we're going to cover his
multi<00:04:00.139> texture<00:04:00.440> mode

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
multi texture mode

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.650 
multi texture mode
so<00:04:01.579> for<00:04:01.910> me<00:04:02.000> I'm<00:04:02.120> going<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.299> go<00:04:02.359> to<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.510> 3d

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
so for me I'm going to go to the 3d

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.319 
so for me I'm going to go to the 3d
viewport<00:04:03.049> I'm<00:04:03.200> gonna<00:04:03.319> hit<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.180> then<00:04:05.180> in

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
viewport I'm gonna hit in and then in

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.990 
viewport I'm gonna hit in and then in
display<00:04:05.569> we're<00:04:05.930> sees<00:04:06.230> says<00:04:06.889> shading<00:04:07.280> we're

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
display we're sees says shading we're

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.599 
display we're sees says shading we're
gonna<00:04:08.120> set<00:04:08.359> this<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.629> multi<00:04:08.930> texture<00:04:09.609> all

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
gonna set this to multi texture all

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.320 
gonna set this to multi texture all
right<00:04:12.099> now

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.979 

we<00:04:15.960> need<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.260> load<00:04:16.620> up<00:04:16.799> our<00:04:17.040> image<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.780> what<00:04:18.900> I'm

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
we need to load up our image so what I'm

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.340 
we need to load up our image so what I'm
going<00:04:19.110> to<00:04:19.170> do<00:04:19.260> real<00:04:19.440> quick<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.830> with<00:04:20.790> our<00:04:20.970> cube

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
going to do real quick is with our cube

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.020 
going to do real quick is with our cube
I'm<00:04:22.350> gonna<00:04:22.530> go<00:04:22.680> over<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.010> texture<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.640> by

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
I'm gonna go over here to texture and by

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.190 
I'm gonna go over here to texture and by
the<00:04:24.090> way<00:04:24.270> if<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.480> don't<00:04:24.600> know<00:04:24.720> how<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.900> move

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
the way if you don't know how to move

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.560

button hold and drag all right now with
our<00:04:33.450> cube<00:04:33.690> selected<00:04:35.510> make<00:04:36.510> sure<00:04:36.660> text<00:04:37.110> which

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
our cube selected make sure text which

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.580 
our cube selected make sure text which
is<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.190> default<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.790> type<00:04:39.660> we<00:04:40.080> want<00:04:40.290> an<00:04:40.380> image

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
is the default the type we want an image

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.030 
is the default the type we want an image
and<00:04:41.460> we<00:04:42.240> want<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.540> open<00:04:42.660> go<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.470> our<00:04:43.620> desktop

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
and we want to open go to our desktop

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.890 
and we want to open go to our desktop
and<00:04:44.900> select<00:04:45.900> texture<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.590> then<00:04:47.010> open<00:04:47.310> image

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
and select texture and then open image

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.150 
and select texture and then open image
all<00:04:48.900> right<00:04:49.520> now<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.850> guess<00:04:51.270> we'll<00:04:51.390> just<00:04:51.450> cover

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
all right now I guess we'll just cover

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.130 
all right now I guess we'll just cover
that's<00:04:53.160> right<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.490> set<00:04:53.790> it<00:04:53.820> to

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
that's right I set it to

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.990 
that's right I set it to
multi-texture<00:04:55.140> sorry<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.590> when<00:04:56.370> we<00:04:56.460> set<00:04:56.670> it<00:04:56.700> to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
multi-texture sorry so when we set it to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.690 
multi-texture sorry so when we set it to
the<00:04:57.800> viewport<00:04:58.800> shading<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.160> notice<00:04:59.400> it's<00:04:59.550> all

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
the viewport shading you notice it's all

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.790 
the viewport shading you notice it's all
white<00:04:59.910> because<00:05:00.090> we<00:05:00.360> don't<00:05:00.540> have<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:00.690> texture<00:05:01.080> so

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
white because we don't have a texture so

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.330 
white because we don't have a texture so
go<00:05:02.130> back<00:05:02.430> inside<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.630> edit<00:05:03.810> mode<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.200> then<00:05:05.100> in

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
go back inside of edit mode and then in

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.620 
go back inside of edit mode and then in
your<00:05:05.670> UV<00:05:06.630> image<00:05:06.930> view<00:05:07.560> port<00:05:08.300> select<00:05:09.300> texture

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
your UV image view port select texture

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.730 
your UV image view port select texture
dot<00:05:09.780> PNG<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:11.780> now<00:05:12.780> you'll<00:05:13.260> notice<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.680> our

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
dot PNG and now you'll notice that our

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.470 
dot PNG and now you'll notice that our
cube<00:05:14.130> is<00:05:14.370> fully<00:05:14.610> textured<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.980> we<00:05:16.980> have<00:05:17.100> high

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
cube is fully textured and we have high

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.040 
cube is fully textured and we have high
which<00:05:18.480> is<00:05:18.660> written<00:05:19.590> kind<00:05:19.890> of<00:05:19.980> odd<00:05:20.310> but<00:05:21.050> that's

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
which is written kind of odd but that's

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.900 
which is written kind of odd but that's
okay

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
okay

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.540 
okay
all<00:05:23.910> right<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:27.740> if<00:05:28.740> we<00:05:28.800> would<00:05:29.040> like<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.250> see

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
all right so if we would like to see

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.600 
all right so if we would like to see
this<00:05:29.760> in<00:05:30.060> GLSL<00:05:31.050> we<00:05:31.440> hit<00:05:31.680> in<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.130> I'm<00:05:32.460> gonna

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
this in GLSL we hit in and I'm gonna

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.770 
this in GLSL we hit in and I'm gonna
collapse<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.680> all<00:05:34.680> right<00:05:35.150> now<00:05:36.150> for<00:05:36.419> shading

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
collapse this all right now for shading

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.040 
collapse this all right now for shading
no<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.470> then<00:05:37.590> set<00:05:37.770> it<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:37.980> GLSL<00:05:38.550> now<00:05:39.360> we're

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
no and then set it to GLSL now we're

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.540 
no and then set it to GLSL now we're
viewing<00:05:40.290> it<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:41.030> GLSL<00:05:42.030> mode<00:05:43.430> there's<00:05:44.430> an

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
viewing it in GLSL mode there's an

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.370 
viewing it in GLSL mode there's an
additional<00:05:44.910> thing<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.390> have<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:45.690> do<00:05:45.810> here<00:05:46.200> and

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
additional thing you have to do here and

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.830 
additional thing you have to do here and
where<00:05:47.310> it's<00:05:47.430> just<00:05:47.520> mapping<00:05:47.790> it<00:05:48.660> says

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
where it's just mapping it says

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.110 
where it's just mapping it says
coordinate<00:05:49.310> you<00:05:50.310> want<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.520> change<00:05:50.730> it<00:05:50.850> over<00:05:50.940> to

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
coordinate you want to change it over to

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.830 
coordinate you want to change it over to
UV<00:05:51.390> and<00:05:52.850> this<00:05:53.850> actually<00:05:54.240> takes<00:05:54.450> into<00:05:54.810> account

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
UV and this actually takes into account

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.159 
UV and this actually takes into account
of<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:56.250> light<00:05:56.430> source<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.690> I'm<00:05:57.810> going<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.050> hit

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
of the light source so I'm going to hit

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.770 
of the light source so I'm going to hit
7<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.760> then<00:06:00.060> I'm<00:06:00.150> going<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.330> shift<00:06:00.510> D

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
7 and then I'm going to shift D

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.159 
7 and then I'm going to shift D
duplicate<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.650> light<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:02.040> few<00:06:02.310> times<00:06:03.169> I'm

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
duplicate the light a few times I'm

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.080 
duplicate the light a few times I'm
gonna<00:06:04.410> move<00:06:04.530> this<00:06:04.680> one<00:06:04.890> down<00:06:04.919> and<00:06:05.760> I'm<00:06:05.880> gonna

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
gonna move this one down and I'm gonna

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.950 
gonna move this one down and I'm gonna
move<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.419> one<00:06:06.630> up<00:06:07.610> all<00:06:08.610> right

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.560 

okay<00:06:14.620> so<00:06:15.070> that<00:06:15.490> concludes<00:06:15.610> this<00:06:15.970> tutorial<00:06:16.449> and

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
okay so that concludes this tutorial and

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.800 
okay so that concludes this tutorial and
texture<00:06:17.139> in<00:06:17.229> a<00:06:17.289> cube<00:06:17.500> and<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:19.120> next<00:06:19.389> tutorial

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
texture in a cube and the next tutorial

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.770 
texture in a cube and the next tutorial
I<00:06:19.990> will<00:06:20.380> cover<00:06:20.560> a<00:06:20.680> little<00:06:20.860> bit<00:06:21.009> more<00:06:21.280> advanced

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
I will cover a little bit more advanced

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.330 
I will cover a little bit more advanced
topics<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:22.990> will<00:06:23.199> texture<00:06:23.590> our<00:06:23.680> natural<00:06:23.979> 3d

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
topics and will texture our natural 3d

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.969 
topics and will texture our natural 3d
model<00:06:24.699> rather<00:06:24.880> than<00:06:25.060> a<00:06:25.180> cube<00:06:25.509> I<00:06:25.830> hope<00:06:26.830> you

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
model rather than a cube I hope you

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.770 
model rather than a cube I hope you
