is<00:02:02.259> being<00:02:02.529> introduced<00:02:03.099> or<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.609> trying<00:02:03.819> to<00:02:04.029> be

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
is being introduced or is trying to be

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.370 
is being introduced or is trying to be
sold<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:05.169> the<00:02:05.349> economy<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:07.119> gold<00:02:07.599> continue<00:02:08.229> to

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
sold in the economy so gold continue to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
sold in the economy so gold continue to
drop<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.700> think<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.200> know<00:02:11.319> maybe<00:02:11.710> maybe

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
drop and I think you know maybe maybe

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.680 
drop and I think you know maybe maybe
not<00:02:12.580> tomorrow<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.450> eventually

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
not tomorrow but eventually

not tomorrow but eventually
a<00:02:14.810> blizzard<00:02:15.440> will<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.130> at<00:02:16.340> least<00:02:16.370> lower

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
a blizzard will have to at least lower

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.410 
a blizzard will have to at least lower
the<00:02:17.900> floor<00:02:18.290> for<00:02:18.980> gold<00:02:19.310> being<00:02:19.550> sold<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.210> the

real money auction house now this is

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.750 
real money auction house now this is
important<00:02:23.570> because<00:02:23.950> right<00:02:24.950> now<00:02:24.980> while<00:02:25.430> gold

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
important because right now while gold

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.600 
important because right now while gold
is<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.300> dollar<00:02:26.720> 07<00:02:27.350> when<00:02:27.980> they<00:02:28.160> would<00:02:28.340> drop<00:02:28.550> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
is a dollar 07 when they would drop the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.090 
is a dollar 07 when they would drop the
floor<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.150> probably<00:02:29.810> drop<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.350> below<00:02:30.590> that

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
floor that probably drop it below that

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.690 
floor that probably drop it below that
value<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:32.510> would<00:02:32.780> immediately<00:02:33.460> drop<00:02:34.460> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
value and it would immediately drop the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.850 
value and it would immediately drop the
value<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.180> gold<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:36.050> reason<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.560> would<00:02:36.710> do

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
value of gold the reason it would do

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.460 
value of gold the reason it would do
this<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.730> current<00:02:38.180> value<00:02:38.300> dollar<00:02:38.870> 07

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
this is the current value dollar 07

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.450 
this is the current value dollar 07
takes<00:02:40.310> into<00:02:40.850> account<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:42.230> possibility<00:02:42.710> of

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
takes into account the possibility of

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.270 
takes into account the possibility of
resale<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.270> gold<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:45.230> significantly<00:02:46.010> more

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
resale and gold for significantly more

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.100 
resale and gold for significantly more
in<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.790> current<00:02:47.120> state<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.630> real<00:02:47.870> money

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
in the current state on the real money

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.000 
in the current state on the real money
auction<00:02:48.200> house<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.870> when<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:51.350> will<00:02:51.530> drop<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
auction house so when they will drop the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.220 
auction house so when they will drop the
floor<00:02:52.400> from<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.670> real<00:02:52.880> money<00:02:53.060> auction<00:02:53.150> us<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
floor from the real money auction us the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.650 
floor from the real money auction us the
gold<00:02:54.470> will<00:02:54.590> go<00:02:54.800> down<00:02:54.980> abruptly<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:57.460> now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
gold will go down abruptly I think now

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.630 
gold will go down abruptly I think now
there's<00:02:59.660> obviously<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.640> counter-argument

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
there's obviously the counter-argument

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.910 
there's obviously the counter-argument
you<00:03:01.850> know<00:03:01.970> when<00:03:02.240> more<00:03:02.510> content<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.350> involves

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
you know when more content that involves

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.280 
you know when more content that involves
people<00:03:04.160> striving<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.940> get<00:03:05.060> better<00:03:05.300> gear<00:03:05.660> comes

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
people striving to get better gear comes

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.160 
people striving to get better gear comes
into<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.650> game<00:03:06.880> then<00:03:07.880> gold<00:03:08.300> will<00:03:08.510> increase<00:03:08.960> in

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
into the game then gold will increase in

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.510 
into the game then gold will increase in
value<00:03:09.550> while<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.300> correct<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:12.290> think<00:03:13.280> that

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
value while that is correct I think that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.300 
value while that is correct I think that
will<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:14.240> that<00:03:14.750> won't<00:03:15.530> be<00:03:15.710> for<00:03:15.860> quite<00:03:16.100> some

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
will be for that won't be for quite some

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.760 
will be for that won't be for quite some
time<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:17.030> think<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:17.810> because<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.470> know<00:03:18.590> it's

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
time I think so because you know it's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.610 
time I think so because you know it's
been<00:03:18.890> several<00:03:19.250> months<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.170> we<00:03:21.170> haven't<00:03:21.530> even

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
been several months and we haven't even

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.530 
been several months and we haven't even
had<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> single<00:03:22.370> patch<00:03:22.580> note<00:03:22.940> that's<00:03:23.270> had<00:03:23.510> a

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
had a single patch note that's had a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.699 
had a single patch note that's had a
title<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.200> 1<00:03:24.500> point<00:03:24.770> 0<00:03:24.920> 4<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:26.900> mean

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
title of 1 point 0 4 on it and I mean

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.710 
title of 1 point 0 4 on it and I mean
what<00:03:27.920> can<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.130> really<00:03:28.370> say<00:03:28.670> for<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.690> next

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
what can you really say for the next

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.780 
what can you really say for the next
patch<00:03:30.080> they<00:03:30.320> plan<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.920> have<00:03:31.100> like<00:03:31.430> item

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
patch they plan to have like item

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.940 
patch they plan to have like item
changes<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.360> whatnot<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.020> I<00:03:33.709> don't<00:03:33.920> even

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
changes and whatnot and I don't even

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.390 
changes and whatnot and I don't even
think<00:03:34.100> that's<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.520> big<00:03:34.670> deal<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:37.160> I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
think that's a big deal so you know I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.070 
think that's a big deal so you know I
don't<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.150> don't<00:03:38.300> think<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:38.840> going<00:03:39.020> to

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
don't I don't think that's going to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.840 
don't I don't think that's going to
increase<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.560> value<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.220> gold<00:03:40.400> too<00:03:40.640> much

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
increase the value of gold too much

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.330 
increase the value of gold too much
maybe<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.330> very<00:03:41.600> small<00:03:42.050> portion<00:03:42.530> temporarily

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
maybe a very small portion temporarily

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.920 
maybe a very small portion temporarily
and<00:03:43.640> then<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:43.880> going<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.030> drop<00:03:44.209> back<00:03:44.420> down<00:03:44.690> I

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
and then it's going to drop back down I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.699 
and then it's going to drop back down I
think<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.620> next<00:03:45.860> big<00:03:46.130> step<00:03:46.370> will<00:03:46.730> be<00:03:46.760> pvp<00:03:47.720> but

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
think the next big step will be pvp but

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.479 
think the next big step will be pvp but
by<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.160> looks<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.850> i<00:03:50.720> think<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.769> floor<00:03:52.250> on

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
by the looks of it i think the floor on

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.509 
by the looks of it i think the floor on
the<00:03:52.519> gold<00:03:53.110> on<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.290> gold<00:03:54.530> prices<00:03:54.800> on<00:03:55.190> real

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
the gold on the gold prices on real

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.070 
the gold on the gold prices on real
money<00:03:55.730> auction<00:03:55.790> house<00:03:56.239> will<00:03:56.630> have<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.989> be

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
money auction house will have to be

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.509 
money auction house will have to be
dropped<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:58.489> lot<00:03:59.390> sooner<00:03:59.690> than<00:04:00.110> what<00:04:00.739> PDP<00:04:01.280> will

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
dropped a lot sooner than what PDP will

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.390 
dropped a lot sooner than what PDP will
probably<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.450> released<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:03.920> want<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.250> guys

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
probably be released so I want you guys

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.850 
probably be released so I want you guys
to<00:04:04.580> keep<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.060> mind<00:04:05.239> um<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.709> know<00:04:06.800> you

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
to keep that in mind um you know you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.420 
to keep that in mind um you know you
don't<00:04:07.190> have<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.700> do<00:04:08.180> exactly<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.950> same<00:04:09.980> things

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
I do but I see this as an opportunity to

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.699 
I do but I see this as an opportunity to
keep<00:04:16.250> value<00:04:16.850> for<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.720> goal<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.230> have<00:04:18.470> in

keep value for the goal that you have in
the<00:04:18.830> game<00:04:19.010> because<00:04:19.489> that's<00:04:19.850> always<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.419> to

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
the game because that's always going to

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.860

know does a purchase order at that time

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.680 
know does a purchase order at that time
they<00:05:07.380> would<00:05:07.530> buy<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.710> person's<00:05:08.490> go<00:05:08.729> so<00:05:09.479> why

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
they would buy that person's go so why

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.240 
they would buy that person's go so why
is<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.870> important<00:05:10.590> it's<00:05:11.130> important<00:05:11.669> because

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
is that important it's important because

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.809 
is that important it's important because
based<00:05:14.250> on<00:05:14.460> your<00:05:14.580> current<00:05:14.639> region<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:16.199> can

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
based on your current region you can

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.270 
based on your current region you can
guess<00:05:17.819> at<00:05:18.150> which<00:05:18.930> times<00:05:19.319> people<00:05:19.860> may<00:05:20.220> be

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
guess at which times people may be

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.850 
guess at which times people may be
buying<00:05:20.610> gold<00:05:20.909> and<00:05:21.210> you'd<00:05:22.050> want<00:05:22.319> to<00:05:22.380> space<00:05:22.830> it

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
buying gold and you'd want to space it

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.309 
buying gold and you'd want to space it
out<00:05:23.130> accordingly<00:05:23.819> so<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.599> means<00:05:25.020> that

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
out accordingly so that means that

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.620 
out accordingly so that means that
because<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.400> auction<00:05:26.819> duration<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.449> day

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
because the auction duration is in day

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.020 
because the auction duration is in day
and<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.840> half<00:05:28.080> let's<00:05:28.800> say<00:05:29.009> you<00:05:29.370> know<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.520> think

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.629 
so I just listed it for the walls but
let's<00:06:04.409> say<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.560> were<00:06:04.770> serious<00:06:05.159> about<00:06:05.280> selling

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
let's say you were serious about selling

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.879 
let's say you were serious about selling
it<00:06:05.880> you<00:06:06.330> wouldn't<00:06:06.599> want<00:06:06.780> to<00:06:06.870> put<00:06:07.229> it<00:06:07.380> up<00:06:07.500> just

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
it you wouldn't want to put it up just

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.399 
it you wouldn't want to put it up just
in<00:06:08.069> one<00:06:08.250> lump<00:06:08.460> sum<00:06:08.659> because<00:06:09.659> you<00:06:10.050> know<00:06:10.169> that

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
in one lump sum because you know that

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.680 
in one lump sum because you know that
would<00:06:10.560> mean<00:06:10.740> that<00:06:11.000> when<00:06:12.000> your<00:06:12.150> goals<00:06:12.419> at<00:06:12.599> the

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
would mean that when your goals at the

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.330 
would mean that when your goals at the
front<00:06:12.960> of<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.169> queue<00:06:13.380> you'd<00:06:13.680> be<00:06:13.830> hoping<00:06:14.159> that

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
front of the queue you'd be hoping that

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.070 
front of the queue you'd be hoping that
someone<00:06:14.610> buys<00:06:14.849> all<00:06:15.090> of<00:06:15.240> it<00:06:15.360> which<00:06:15.750> is<00:06:15.900> actually

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
someone buys all of it which is actually

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.499 
someone buys all of it which is actually
very<00:06:16.380> very<00:06:16.740> unlikely<00:06:17.370> what<00:06:18.150> I<00:06:18.180> would<00:06:18.389> suggest

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
very very unlikely what I would suggest

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.200 
very very unlikely what I would suggest
is<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:19.289> space<00:06:19.650> your<00:06:19.889> goal<00:06:20.099> of<00:06:20.250> your<00:06:20.849> goal<00:06:21.060> down

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
is to space your goal of your goal down

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.870 
is to space your goal of your goal down
ten<00:06:21.599> portions<00:06:22.110> or<00:06:22.229> you<00:06:23.039> know<00:06:23.159> fewer<00:06:23.520> if<00:06:23.729> you're

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
ten portions or you know fewer if you're

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.219 
ten portions or you know fewer if you're
actually<00:06:24.030> selling<00:06:24.449> items<00:06:24.719> on<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:24.930> real<00:06:25.050> money

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
actually selling items on the real money

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.959 
actually selling items on the real money
options<00:06:25.590> just<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.919> fill<00:06:26.130> up<00:06:26.250> all<00:06:26.430> your<00:06:26.610> slots

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
options just to fill up all your slots

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.180 
options just to fill up all your slots
as<00:06:27.150> much<00:06:27.300> as<00:06:27.449> possible<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:28.080> what<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:28.830> would<00:06:28.949> do

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
as much as possible and what I would do

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.999 
as much as possible and what I would do
is<00:06:29.460> I<00:06:29.490> would<00:06:29.969> space<00:06:30.419> it<00:06:30.630> out<00:06:30.719> at<00:06:30.930> least<00:06:31.009> maybe

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
is I would space it out at least maybe

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.370 
is I would space it out at least maybe
five<00:06:32.400> or<00:06:32.430> ten<00:06:32.849> minutes<00:06:32.880> apart<00:06:33.449> so<00:06:33.990> let's<00:06:34.259> see

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
five or ten minutes apart so let's see

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.930 
five or ten minutes apart so let's see
you<00:06:34.440> had<00:06:34.589> all<00:06:34.770> ten<00:06:35.010> slots<00:06:35.250> available<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:35.880> you

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
you had all ten slots available and you

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.390 
you had all ten slots available and you
want

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
want

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.480 
want
100<00:06:36.699> million<00:06:36.970> gold<00:06:37.530> you<00:06:38.530> know<00:06:38.650> my<00:06:38.860> suggestion

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
100 million gold you know my suggestion

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.659 
100 million gold you know my suggestion
maybe<00:06:40.419> give<00:06:40.630> it<00:06:40.750> a<00:06:40.810> try<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.770> post<00:06:42.040> 10<00:06:42.340> million

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
maybe give it a try you post 10 million

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.629 
maybe give it a try you post 10 million
at<00:06:42.850> like<00:06:43.449> Thursday<00:06:43.930> 5am<00:06:44.530> or<00:06:44.710> maybe<00:06:45.039> four<00:06:45.370> a.m.

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
at like Thursday 5am or maybe four a.m.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.790 
at like Thursday 5am or maybe four a.m.
and<00:06:45.750> you<00:06:46.750> wait<00:06:46.900> 10<00:06:47.080> minutes<00:06:47.289> you<00:06:47.470> post<00:06:47.650> another

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
and you wait 10 minutes you post another

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.260 
and you wait 10 minutes you post another
ten<00:06:48.070> million<00:06:48.280> wait<00:06:48.669> another<00:06:48.850> 10<00:06:49.120> minutes

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
ten million wait another 10 minutes

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.120 
ten million wait another 10 minutes
those<00:06:49.539> nine<00:06:49.720> to<00:06:49.780> 10<00:06:49.990> million<00:06:50.169> and<00:06:50.590> I<00:06:50.919> think

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
those nine to 10 million and I think

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.710 
those nine to 10 million and I think
you'll<00:06:51.220> have<00:06:51.370> a<00:06:51.400> lot<00:06:51.639> more<00:06:51.699> success<00:06:52.330> at<00:06:52.509> that

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
you'll have a lot more success at that

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.200 
you'll have a lot more success at that
rather<00:06:53.380> than<00:06:53.500> selling<00:06:53.800> at<00:06:54.130> random<00:06:54.669> times<00:06:54.850> in<00:06:55.150> a

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
rather than selling at random times in a

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.680 
rather than selling at random times in a
whole<00:06:55.389> lump<00:06:55.630> sum<00:06:55.930> but<00:06:57.240> does<00:06:58.240> it<00:06:58.270> really<00:06:58.419> matter

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
whole lump sum but does it really matter

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.110 
whole lump sum but does it really matter
I<00:06:58.990> think<00:06:59.350> you'll<00:06:59.470> sell<00:06:59.680> eventually<00:07:00.280> unless

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
I think you'll sell eventually unless

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.060 
I think you'll sell eventually unless
obviously<00:07:02.050> you're<00:07:02.199> doing<00:07:02.470> the<00:07:02.620> buying<00:07:02.919> and

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
obviously you're doing the buying and

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.950 
obviously you're doing the buying and
selling<00:07:03.190> or<00:07:03.639> your<00:07:03.759> button<00:07:04.120> then<00:07:04.630> maybe<00:07:04.840> you

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
selling or your button then maybe you

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.350 
selling or your button then maybe you
want<00:07:05.110> to<00:07:05.169> optimize<00:07:05.470> it<00:07:05.860> severely<00:07:06.280> but<00:07:06.970> besides

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
want to optimize it severely but besides

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.810 
want to optimize it severely but besides
that<00:07:07.740> people<00:07:08.740> are<00:07:08.830> still<00:07:09.070> buying<00:07:09.220> the<00:07:09.400> gold<00:07:09.610> I

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
that people are still buying the gold I

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.850 
that people are still buying the gold I
don't<00:07:10.449> understand<00:07:10.960> why<00:07:11.199> but<00:07:11.500> they're

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
don't understand why but they're

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.560 
don't understand why but they're
definitely<00:07:12.039> not<00:07:12.340> buying<00:07:12.880> it<00:07:13.090> at<00:07:13.210> the<00:07:13.330> same

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
definitely not buying it at the same

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.930 
definitely not buying it at the same
rate<00:07:13.800> of<00:07:14.800> which<00:07:15.160> it's<00:07:15.370> coming<00:07:15.669> into<00:07:15.850> the

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
rate of which it's coming into the

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.540 
rate of which it's coming into the
system<00:07:16.180> and<00:07:16.650> that's<00:07:17.650> causing<00:07:18.190> the<00:07:18.340> goal<00:07:18.520> to

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
system and that's causing the goal to

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
system and that's causing the goal to
lose<00:07:18.729> value<00:07:19.440> so<00:07:20.440> keep<00:07:21.039> that<00:07:21.070> in<00:07:21.280> mind<00:07:21.370> I<00:07:22.210> know

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
lose value so keep that in mind I know

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.689 
lose value so keep that in mind I know
what's<00:07:22.780> going<00:07:23.050> on<00:07:23.169> because<00:07:23.650> you<00:07:24.490> know<00:07:24.610> if

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
what's going on because you know if

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:25.860 
what's going on because you know if
you're<00:07:24.910> if<00:07:25.090> you're<00:07:25.210> taking<00:07:25.449> a<00:07:25.660> break<00:07:25.810> from

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
you're if you're taking a break from

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.290 
you're if you're taking a break from
Diablo<00:07:26.470> 3<00:07:26.740> you<00:07:27.310> don't<00:07:27.460> want<00:07:27.580> to<00:07:27.669> come<00:07:27.880> back<00:07:28.060> and
