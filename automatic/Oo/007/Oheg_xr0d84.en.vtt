00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.340 
button and also these things run on to
triple-a<00:00:47.870> batteries<00:00:48.290> so<00:00:50.050> relatively<00:00:51.050> light

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
triple-a batteries so relatively light

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.319 
triple-a batteries so relatively light
and<00:00:51.680> not<00:00:52.309> too<00:00:52.520> big<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.510> which<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.500> nice<00:00:54.680> and

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
and not too big so which is nice and

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.639 
and not too big so which is nice and
basically<00:00:58.450> this<00:00:59.450> sounds<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.170> camera

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
basically this sounds to the camera

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.990 
basically this sounds to the camera
how'd<00:01:01.430> she<00:01:01.730> run<00:01:02.210> relatively<00:01:03.140> easy<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:04.670> slides

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
how'd she run relatively easy the slides

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.980 
how'd she run relatively easy the slides
on<00:01:05.740> basically<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:07.490> guess<00:01:07.789> what<00:01:08.630> how<00:01:08.869> do<00:01:08.929> you

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
on basically is I guess what how do you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.730 
on basically is I guess what how do you
have<00:01:09.200> fiction<00:01:09.590> mounted<00:01:10.030> there's<00:01:11.030> no<00:01:11.209> lack<00:01:11.740> so

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
have fiction mounted there's no lack so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.010 
have fiction mounted there's no lack so
people<00:01:13.130> might<00:01:13.219> be<00:01:13.280> worried<00:01:13.759> about<00:01:14.030> these

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
people might be worried about these

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.459 
people might be worried about these
falling<00:01:15.499> off<00:01:15.880> it's<00:01:16.880> relatively<00:01:17.450> snug<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.319> it's

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
falling off it's relatively snug so it's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.859 
falling off it's relatively snug so it's
not<00:01:18.529> gonna<00:01:18.770> holla<00:01:19.069> you<00:01:19.729> probably<00:01:19.999> have<00:01:20.179> to<00:01:20.240> hit

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
not gonna holla you probably have to hit

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.690 
not gonna holla you probably have to hit
pretty<00:01:21.859> hard<00:01:21.950> welsh<00:01:22.490> name<00:01:23.889> let's<00:01:24.889> say<00:01:25.069> you'd

have<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.939> hit<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.119> pretty<00:01:26.299> good<00:01:26.779> to<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:27.409> these

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
have to hit it pretty good to get these

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.870 
have to hit it pretty good to get these
things<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.859> come<00:01:28.009> out<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:29.649> not<00:01:30.649> too<00:01:30.799> bad<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
things to come out so not too bad the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.980 
things to come out so not too bad the
profile<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.249> also

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
profile and also

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.969 
profile and also
you<00:01:35.860> know<00:01:36.009> not<00:01:36.939> too<00:01:37.240> bulky<00:01:37.479> I<00:01:37.899> wouldn't<00:01:38.890> worry

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
you know not too bulky I wouldn't worry

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.730 
you know not too bulky I wouldn't worry
about<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.399> falling<00:01:39.700> off<00:01:39.820> unless<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:41.170> mount

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
about this falling off unless you mount

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.889 
about this falling off unless you mount
a<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:43.869> ass<00:01:44.080> flash<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.759> then<00:01:46.360> I'd<00:01:46.689> be<00:01:46.869> a

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
a big ass flash like this then I'd be a

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.590 
a big ass flash like this then I'd be a
little<00:01:47.049> worried<00:01:47.439> but<00:01:48.189> for<00:01:48.580> my<00:01:48.670> use<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.240> won't<00:01:49.539> be

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
little worried but for my use I won't be

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.109 
little worried but for my use I won't be
using<00:01:49.899> both<00:01:50.289> of<00:01:50.500> these<00:01:50.619> on<00:01:51.580> top<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.909> camera

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
using both of these on top of the camera

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.289 
using both of these on top of the camera
so<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:54.280> not<00:01:54.460> going<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.640> be<00:01:54.700> too<00:01:54.880> worried<00:01:55.210> about

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
so I'm not going to be too worried about

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.590 
so I'm not going to be too worried about
it<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:56.080> other<00:01:56.950> than<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.280> let's<00:01:58.000> give<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.420> a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
it so other than that let's give it a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.260 
it so other than that let's give it a
try<00:01:59.070> one<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.250> main<00:02:00.429> reasons<00:02:00.789> i<00:02:00.909> got<00:02:01.090> this

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
try one of the main reasons i got this

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.590 
try one of the main reasons i got this
is<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:01.659> i<00:02:01.720> can<00:02:01.960> shoot<00:02:02.200> my<00:02:02.590> flash<00:02:03.399> remotely<00:02:03.880> so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
is so i can shoot my flash remotely so

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.940 
is so i can shoot my flash remotely so
we'll<00:02:04.750> do<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:05.020> real<00:02:05.320> quick<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:07.799> turn<00:02:08.799> this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
we'll do this real quick and turn this

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.259 
we'll do this real quick and turn this
guy<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.399> we'll<00:02:10.330> turn<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:12.269> know

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
guy on we'll turn this on and know

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.960 
guy on we'll turn this on and know
anything<00:02:13.600> bad<00:02:13.810> about<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.430> location

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
anything bad about this is the location

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.229 
anything bad about this is the location
of<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.420> on/off<00:02:16.750> switch<00:02:17.760> you'd<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> turn

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
of the on/off switch you'd have to turn

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.530 
of the on/off switch you'd have to turn
it<00:02:19.390> on<00:02:19.510> first<00:02:20.190> before<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.340> mount<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.209> the

it on first before you mount it to the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
it on first before you mount it to the
flash<00:02:22.870> or<00:02:23.200> else<00:02:23.350> you'll<00:02:23.500> never<00:02:23.709> be<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.920> turn<00:02:24.130> it

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
so let's try next thing one of the

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.530 
so let's try next thing one of the
reasons<00:02:53.170> i<00:02:53.410> got<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.709> also<00:02:53.890> was<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.269> i<00:02:55.359> can

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
reasons i got this also was so i can

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.599 
reasons i got this also was so i can
shoot<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.780> camera<00:02:56.320> remotely<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.400> i<00:02:57.430> can

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
shoot the camera remotely so i can

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.270 
shoot the camera remotely so i can
finally<00:02:57.850> be<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.239> picture<00:02:58.980> pretty<00:02:59.980> much<00:03:00.130> most

picture so we'll give this a try it's

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.559 
picture so we'll give this a try it's
relatively<00:03:10.239> simple<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.299> shutter

release<00:03:13.810> cable<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:16.500> transmitter<00:03:17.500> and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
release cable to the transmitter and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.630 
release cable to the transmitter and
we'll<00:03:18.730> plug<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.299> port<00:03:22.930> over<00:03:23.200> here

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:39.960

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
little simple distance test is about 40

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.590 
little simple distance test is about 40
or<00:05:55.010> 50<00:05:55.340> feet<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.850> is<00:05:55.880> probably<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.420> longest
