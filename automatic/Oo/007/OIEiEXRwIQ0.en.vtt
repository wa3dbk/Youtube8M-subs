sanded<00:02:28.410> smooth<00:02:28.770> all<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:30.210> way<00:02:30.240> around<00:02:30.420> no<00:02:31.110> thin

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
sanded smooth all the way around no thin

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.770 
sanded smooth all the way around no thin
or<00:02:31.530> thick<00:02:31.560> spots<00:02:32.070> which<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.880> awesome<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
or thick spots which is awesome this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.830 
or thick spots which is awesome this
deck<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.050> 28<00:02:34.680> millimeters<00:02:35.250> wide<00:02:35.520> x<00:02:36.120> 100<00:02:36.630> long

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
deck is 28 millimeters wide x 100 long

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.510 
deck is 28 millimeters wide x 100 long
so<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.860> very<00:02:38.460> good<00:02:38.730> size<00:02:39.200> pretty<00:02:40.200> much<00:02:40.410> a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
so it's very good size pretty much a

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.210 
so it's very good size pretty much a
standard<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:42.150> any<00:02:42.300> custom<00:02:42.780> fingerboard<00:02:43.290> 28<00:02:44.070> x

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
standard for any custom fingerboard 28 x

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.950 
standard for any custom fingerboard 28 x
100<00:02:45.620> kicks<00:02:46.880> definitely<00:02:47.880> medium<00:02:48.300> maybe<00:02:48.630> low

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
100 kicks definitely medium maybe low

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.270 
100 kicks definitely medium maybe low
probably<00:02:49.920> low<00:02:50.130> medium<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.590> feel<00:02:52.950> higher

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
probably low medium that you feel higher

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.070 
probably low medium that you feel higher
than<00:02:53.550> they<00:02:53.670> look<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:54.150> some<00:02:54.330> reason<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.870> think

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
than they look for some reason I think

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.850 
than they look for some reason I think
it's<00:02:55.410> because<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.150> low<00:02:57.150> medium<00:02:57.660> concave<00:02:58.350> it's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
it's because the low medium concave it's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.790 
it's because the low medium concave it's
a<00:02:58.980> very<00:02:59.190> round<00:02:59.520> concave<00:03:00.170> it's<00:03:01.170> very<00:03:01.320> smooth

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
a very round concave it's very smooth

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400 
a very round concave it's very smooth
and<00:03:02.160> gradual<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.900> got<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:04.290> good

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and gradual so it's got a really good

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.980 
and gradual so it's got a really good
feeling<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.160> which<00:03:05.910> makes<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.480> concave

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
feeling to it which makes the concave

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.340 
feeling to it which makes the concave
and<00:03:07.170> kicks<00:03:07.410> fuel<00:03:08.130> higher<00:03:08.940> than<00:03:09.240> they<00:03:09.330> are<00:03:09.480> it's

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and kicks fuel higher than they are it's

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.040 
and kicks fuel higher than they are it's
hard<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.040> explain<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.670> mean<00:03:12.300> they<00:03:12.600> really<00:03:12.780> do

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
hard to explain I mean they really do

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.420 
hard to explain I mean they really do
though<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.470> didn't<00:03:13.890> think<00:03:13.950> I'd<00:03:14.100> be<00:03:14.220> able<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
though I didn't think I'd be able to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.030 
though I didn't think I'd be able to
kickflip<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:15.240> deck<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.290> law<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.650> kicks

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
kickflip a deck with this law of kicks

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.699 
kickflip a deck with this law of kicks
when<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> first<00:03:18.060> saw<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:19.200> kick<00:03:19.440> flips

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
when I first saw it but it kick flips

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.010 
when I first saw it but it kick flips
just<00:03:20.070> like<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> deck<00:03:20.490> with<00:03:20.700> steeper<00:03:21.090> kicks<00:03:21.390> so

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
just like a deck with steeper kicks so

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.250 
just like a deck with steeper kicks so
definitely<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> good<00:03:23.070> size<00:03:23.480> kicks<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.780> concave

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
definitely a good size kicks and concave

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.850 
definitely a good size kicks and concave
for<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.650> deck<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:28.230> can<00:03:28.260> definitely<00:03:28.560> do

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
for this deck you can definitely do

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.130 
for this deck you can definitely do
tricks<00:03:29.160> with<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.490> when<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.420> was<00:03:30.600> mounting<00:03:30.990> up

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
tricks with it when I was mounting up

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.960 
tricks with it when I was mounting up
the<00:03:31.320> trucks<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.680> hardware<00:03:32.010> that's<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.730> very

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the trucks and hardware that's a very

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.040 
the trucks and hardware that's a very
big<00:03:33.209> deal<00:03:34.280> with<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> lot<00:03:35.490> of<00:03:35.670> decks<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.810> one

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
big deal with a lot of decks this one

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.340 
big deal with a lot of decks this one
mounted<00:03:37.709> up<00:03:37.860> very<00:03:38.310> nice<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.880> had<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.900> king<00:03:40.170> pin

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
mounted up very nice I had the king pin

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.060 
mounted up very nice I had the king pin
holes<00:03:40.620> drilled<00:03:41.580> through<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.880> bottom<00:03:42.209> apply

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
holes drilled through the bottom apply

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.710 
holes drilled through the bottom apply
also<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.340> top<00:03:44.550> which<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.180> can't<00:03:45.390> see<00:03:45.450> now

also on the top which you can't see now
but<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.560> holes<00:03:46.800> were<00:03:47.070> countersunk<00:03:47.610> perfectly

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
but the holes were countersunk perfectly

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300 
but the holes were countersunk perfectly
the<00:03:48.870> screw<00:03:49.140> heads<00:03:49.350> dropped<00:03:49.650> right<00:03:49.920> down<00:03:49.950> in

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
the screw heads dropped right down in

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.430 
the screw heads dropped right down in
there<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.730> there's<00:03:50.940> no<00:03:51.090> bumps<00:03:54.050> kingpins<00:03:55.050> went

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
there so there's no bumps kingpins went

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.960 
there so there's no bumps kingpins went
right<00:03:55.650> down<00:03:55.830> in<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.100> holes<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:56.580> they<00:03:56.730> should
