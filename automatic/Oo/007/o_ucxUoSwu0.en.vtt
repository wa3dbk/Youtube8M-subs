00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:04.797
The richest Khan of Bollywood families.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.595
Sajid Ali Khan. Yes.

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:10.257
We know him as Saif Ali Khan.

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:13.581
"Just talk to me lovingly once."

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:16.840
"Talk lovingly, my friend."

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.825
He was born on 16th August,
1970 in Delhi.

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:23.867
His father Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi..

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:26.880
..was the captain of
the Indian cricket team.

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.784
And he was also the Nawab of Pataudi.

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:32.568
His mother is great actress
legendary Sharmila Tagore.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:37.190
Will you finish three
lives to save mine?

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:42.368
Most of the people in Saif's
family are connected to cricket.

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.652
Like his grandfather
Iftekar Ali Khan Pataudi..

00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.436
..had played for England.

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:50.571
Young Saif was educated
in Lawrence School..

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:53.490
..in Sanawar, Himachal Pradesh.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.678
And then he was being sent
to Lockers Park School, England

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:03.556
Wow! What a nice pen. Is it imported?

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:08.991
After his studies he wished
to head towards Bollywood.

00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:11.180
Though he could have chosen cricket.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.761
But his mother Sharmila
Tagore influenced him more.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:15.437
Yes.

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:20.219
And he was launched in
1993 in film 'Aashik Aawara'.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.329
And here Sharmila Tagore
had played his mother.

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:28.032
Saif Ali Khan was doing everything
that a Hindi film hero required to do.

00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:30.032
He was dancing. Doing comedy.

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:32.073
Action and emotion.

00:01:32.153 --> 00:01:35.910
Gopal I will die,
if anything happens to you.

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:40.951
No, friend. For God's sake, kill me.

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:45.018
For God's sake,
kill me but don't give me a life..

00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:46.802
..which is worse than death.

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:51.554
At one time he used to
get less films as a single hero.

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:54.365
And he was doing wonders
in multi starrers.

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:57.337
Like 'Main Khiladi Tu Anari',
'Imtihan'..

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.581
..'Kachche Dhaage',
'Hum Saath Saath Hain'.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.683
By 2000 it seemed that Saif Ali Khan..

00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:05.115
..would only do multi starrer films.

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:09.277
And then his life was changed by a film.

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:12.858
This film was Farhan
Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai'.

00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:15.825
He did this film with
Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna.

00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:20.135
What are you doing?

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:22.771
I was surprising you.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.027
This is not a surprise but a shock.

00:02:25.107 --> 00:02:26.608
And I don't like getting shocks.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.356
Saif Ali Khan had won
the Best male debut Award..

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:31.478
..for his first movie 'Aashik Awara;.

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.086
After that he was also awarded as..

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.627
..the best performer
in a comic category.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.756
And he also got the nation
film award for 'Hum Tum'.

00:02:41.622 --> 00:02:44.260
On one hand he wanted
to become famous in films.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.481
On the other hand even
love was beckoning to him.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.827
He married awesome actress Amrita Singh.

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:54.595
She was elder to him by 12 years.

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.383
He had two children off this marriage.

00:02:56.638 --> 00:03:00.325
Daughter Sara Ali Khan
and son Ibrahim Ali Khan.

00:03:00.524 --> 00:03:02.265
This marriage lasted for 13 years.

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:06.135
And they divorced by 2004.

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:10.103
"I hide everything in my heart."

00:03:10.183 --> 00:03:14.714
"This is my fault."

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.030
"The more one is in love,
the more silent he is."

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.421
The kids stayed with their mother.

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:26.421
And at that time Saif
Ali Khan's film career..

00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.831
..was achieving new heights.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:31.804
Uncle, I have been
waiting for you since long.

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:35.052
Uncle said that today is
the last date to sign a contract.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.128
He had broken off one relationship..

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.734
..and was ready to enter another.

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.925
Co-incidentally Kareena Kapoor..

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:44.525
..and Shahid Kapoor broke up.

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:47.876
Kareena Kapoor came
closer to Saif Ali Khan.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.298
And then they discussed marriage.

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:54.094
And then Kareena Kapoor
became Kareena Kapoor Khan..

00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:56.094
..after marrying Saif Ali Khan.

00:03:56.174 --> 00:03:58.018
No, you are wrong. I have decided.

00:03:58.408 --> 00:04:02.619
You won't go anywhere and
our love will become history.

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.884
They got married on 16th October, 2012.

00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:10.316
Though at this time Saif
Ali Khan had a personal tragedy.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.635
His father Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi..

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:16.116
..passed away on 22nd September, 2011.

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:21.424
Saif Ali Khan worked in a lot of films.

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:23.086
He played many roles.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.508
Whether it is Langda Tyagi of 'Omkara'.

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:27.573
Or the lover boy of 'Hum Tum'.

00:04:27.653 --> 00:04:31.410
"You smile when you see me."

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.299
"To look away after
looking into my eyes."

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:41.315
"Darling, this is love."

00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:44.407
Saif Ali Khan didn't
only do romantic films.

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:46.256
But he was also praised
for his work in thriller like..

00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:49.196
..'Agent Vinod' and 'Ek Hasina Thi'..

00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:50.980
And it needs to be
noted that his reel life..

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.849
..chemistry was most successful
with Deepika Padukone.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.812
And real life chemistry
was with Kareena Kapoor.

00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:09.181
"Don't love me so much
that I can't stay away from you."

00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:13.613
For sure Saif Ali Khan
is one of those actor..

00:05:13.693 --> 00:05:17.042
..who had managed his
career with a lot of thought.

00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:22.026
"I can't stay away from you."
