00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.380 
it's the little boy it's not that far
behind<00:02:26.019> actually<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.709> very<00:02:26.799> interesting

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
behind actually it's very interesting

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.369 
behind actually it's very interesting
okay<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> little<00:02:28.720> bit<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:28.989> here<00:02:29.230> when

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
okay it's a little bit like here when

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.990 
okay it's a little bit like here when
it's<00:02:29.530> loading<00:02:29.799> up<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.610> mean<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.849> have<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
it's loading up but I mean we have a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.550 
it's loading up but I mean we have a
single<00:02:31.360> core<00:02:31.599> device<00:02:31.930> there<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
single core device there this one is

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.170 
single core device there this one is
like<00:02:32.739> single<00:02:33.010> core<00:02:33.159> if<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.519> remember

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
like single core if I can remember

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.680 
like single core if I can remember
correctly

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
correctly

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.020 
correctly
maybe<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.019> steel<00:02:35.200> core<00:02:35.470> Wow<00:02:36.250> no<00:02:36.549> I'm<00:02:36.790> getting

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
maybe it's steel core Wow no I'm getting

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.069 
maybe it's steel core Wow no I'm getting
totally<00:02:37.569> confused

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
totally confused

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.929 
totally confused
it<00:02:38.409> could<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.769> dual<00:02:39.010> core<00:02:39.159> if<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.549> could<00:02:39.700> very

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
it could be dual core if we could very

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.449 
it could be dual core if we could very
likely<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> Corvette<00:02:41.049> this<00:02:41.530> device<00:02:41.859> runs

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
likely be do a Corvette this device runs

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.550 
likely be do a Corvette this device runs
pretty<00:02:42.700> nice<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:43.329> also<00:02:43.480> has<00:02:43.659> good<00:02:43.840> GPU<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.530> I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
pretty nice it also has good GPU like I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.589 
pretty nice it also has good GPU like I
don't<00:02:44.680> know<00:02:44.859> 300<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.790> can't<00:02:46.030> recall<00:02:46.180> a

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
pretty same GPU inside of this little

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.940 
pretty same GPU inside of this little
boy<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.720> performs<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.409> mean<00:02:50.530> saying<00:02:50.799> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.690 
GTA san andreas and like asphalt base
I'm<00:02:56.709> pretty<00:02:56.920> sure<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.190> can't<00:02:57.400> get<00:02:57.579> those

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
I'm pretty sure you can't get those

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.670 
I'm pretty sure you can't get those
games<00:02:57.970> because<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.510> think<00:02:58.569> I've<00:02:58.780> tried<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.470> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
games because I think I've tried in the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.160 
games because I think I've tried in the
past<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.940> still<00:03:01.150> pretty<00:03:01.389> very<00:03:02.109> pretty

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
past but still pretty very pretty

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.660 
past but still pretty very pretty
interesting<00:03:02.799> here<00:03:02.980> when<00:03:03.159> I'm<00:03:03.280> checking<00:03:03.459> this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
interesting here when I'm checking this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.699 
interesting here when I'm checking this
out<00:03:03.879> so<00:03:04.239> might<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:04.840> more<00:03:04.989> videos<00:03:05.319> with<00:03:05.530> these

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
out so might do more videos with these

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.680 
out so might do more videos with these
two<00:03:05.859> devices<00:03:06.040> people<00:03:06.760> are<00:03:06.879> interested<00:03:07.480> in

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
two devices people are interested in

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.060 
two devices people are interested in
interested<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.620> yeah<00:03:09.159> quick<00:03:09.790> video
