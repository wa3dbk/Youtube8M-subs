00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.450
 good friends 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.189
 as we said in the month of May we put 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.830
 the elevator at your disposal and here 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.700
 we are with an Asian in this case a 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.700
 toyota tercel of year 98 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.100
 and well what we are going to review is this 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.530
 suspension component 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 the state of the tires 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.060
 bearings of the spindles 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.700
 shock absorbers 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.960
 let's look also 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 naphtha cane 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 in the state 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.960
 the suspension bushes that there is not 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.490
 loss of brake fluid after we go 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.950
 to control 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.950
 the part of the floor 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.969
 the student and gravel protector 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.449
 It is in good condition that there is no 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.449
 oxide 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.000
 we are also going to look 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.030
 the part of the front suspension 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.940
 what has to do with the bushings 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.250
 grills pointers dimensions this that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.700
 is here this is a component 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.860
 important safety this rubber is the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.370
 bellows of the kinetic master in there from 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.150
 fat has to be healthy 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.640
 we are also going to see if there is not 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.300
 lubricant losses through the box 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.860
 change or the semi-shaft seals 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.850
 if the engine 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.160
 does not lose oil on the one hand also 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.160
 let's review the brake pads 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.320
 after the genetics on the other side 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.409
 you also have to look at the radiator 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.590
 in the bottom part we acquire 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.770
 a mango 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.180
 so good conditions 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.940
 around 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.290
 so dry 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.290
 you do not see in tasks and well basically 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.130
 what it refers 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.130
 to the low chassis
