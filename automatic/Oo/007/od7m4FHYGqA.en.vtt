interpret<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.689> lift<00:00:24.900> falling<00:00:26.480> let's

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
interpret it as the lift falling let's

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
interpret it as the lift falling let's
have<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> look<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.529> case

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.860 

Oh<00:00:44.390> what<00:00:45.390> happened<00:00:45.810> is<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.410> left<00:00:46.620> falling

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
Oh what happened is the left falling

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.160 
Oh what happened is the left falling
let's<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.380> really<00:00:49.680> happened

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
let's see what really happened

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.110 
let's see what really happened
when<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.200> high<00:00:53.470> speed<00:00:53.980> lift<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.520> traveling<00:00:55.030> in

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
when a high speed lift is traveling in

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840 
when a high speed lift is traveling in
the<00:00:55.240> upwards<00:00:55.720> direction<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:57.070> car<00:00:57.310> position

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
the upwards direction the car position

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.990 
the upwards direction the car position
indicator<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.630> running<00:00:58.930> ahead<00:00:59.370> for<00:01:00.370> instance

the car might be at floor 38 when
passengers<00:01:04.540> see<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.140> car<00:01:05.350> position

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
passengers see the car position

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.240 
passengers see the car position
indicator<00:01:06.340> displaying<00:01:06.910> floor<00:01:07.420> 42<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:09.070> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
emergency stop activates the indicator

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.490 
emergency stop activates the indicator

car position being floor 38 in the
meantime<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.720> lift<00:01:19.990> decelerates<00:01:20.950> quickly

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
meantime the lift decelerates quickly

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.700 
meantime the lift decelerates quickly
and<00:01:21.690> passengers<00:01:22.690> might<00:01:22.960> feel<00:01:23.229> slightly

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
and passengers might feel slightly

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.270 
and passengers might feel slightly
weightless<00:01:24.400> due<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.090> inertia<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.710> above<00:01:26.979> 2

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
weightless due to inertia the above 2

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.460 
weightless due to inertia the above 2
effects<00:01:27.640> might<00:01:28.060> cause<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.690> interpretation

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
effects might cause the interpretation

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.010 
effects might cause the interpretation
of<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> lift<00:01:29.890> falling<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.729> fact<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.600> lift<00:01:31.840> did

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
of the lift falling in fact the lift did

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.200 
of the lift falling in fact the lift did
not<00:01:32.290> fall<00:01:32.590> down<00:01:32.800> and<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.580> passengers<00:01:34.060> are

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
not fall down and the passengers are

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.340 
not fall down and the passengers are
very<00:01:34.479> safe<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.970> let's<00:01:37.479> look<00:01:37.690> at<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.960> second

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
very safe now let's look at the second

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:53.920 
very safe now let's look at the second
case

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.640 

look<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.470> lift<00:01:55.680> stopped<00:01:56.780> what<00:01:57.780> happened<00:01:58.230> the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
look the lift stopped what happened the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.280 
look the lift stopped what happened the
lift<00:01:58.890> fell<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.400> did<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> lift<00:02:00.480> really<00:02:00.810> fall

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
lift fell down did the lift really fall

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.850 
lift fell down did the lift really fall
let's<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.550> what<00:02:02.820> exactly<00:02:03.570> happened<00:02:04.020> consider

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
let's see what exactly happened consider

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.790 
let's see what exactly happened consider
the<00:02:05.100> lift<00:02:05.340> has<00:02:05.610> an<00:02:05.790> emergency<00:02:06.110> stop-loss<00:02:07.110> 15

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
the lift has an emergency stop-loss 15

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.130 
the lift has an emergency stop-loss 15
it<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.460> then<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.210> travel<00:02:09.509> down<00:02:09.660> with

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
it is then going to travel down with

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
it is then going to travel down with
synchronization<00:02:10.740> speed<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.150> slower

synchronization speed which is slower

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.110 
synchronization speed which is slower
than<00:02:12.810> normal<00:02:12.990> speed<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.770> floor<00:02:14.040> 1<00:02:14.250> during<00:02:14.940> this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
position of floor 15 it will quickly

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.810 
position of floor 15 it will quickly
update<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.750> show<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.110> real<00:02:22.350> position<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.550> is
