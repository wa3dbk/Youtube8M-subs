00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.189
 you two another video this time that was a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.559
 video here for you I just 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.870
 I want to let you know that your husband is having 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 a lack of frequent videos of this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.449
 This last week was a day 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.189
 Not day and video had two days without in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.560
 last week also had some 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.869
 days without just to say that it was 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.660
 tight this weekend I went out 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 then it was too tight for me I 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 to record the days I have to record 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.870
 Tuesday and Thursday is difficult to record 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 I had a fourth and sixth private class. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 because now you will have the evidence then 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.940
 was too tight to record even the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 time was free and I ended up not recording 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.770
 because I wanted to like to record everything 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.149
 direct knows several videos in a row 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.060

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.220
