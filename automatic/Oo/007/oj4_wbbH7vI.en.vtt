hi<00:00:06.700> I'm<00:00:07.060> Michael<00:00:07.570> the<00:00:08.020> lead<00:00:08.200> developer<00:00:08.650> here

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
hi I'm Michael the lead developer here

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.920 
hi I'm Michael the lead developer here
at<00:00:08.860> circular<00:00:09.310> logic<00:00:09.400> and<00:00:09.790> this<00:00:10.389> demo<00:00:10.720> i'll

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
at circular logic and this demo i'll

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.690 
at circular logic and this demo i'll
show<00:00:11.230> you<00:00:11.290> how<00:00:11.380> well<00:00:11.740> in<00:00:11.980> time<00:00:12.219> can<00:00:12.460> track

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
show you how well in time can track

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.550 
show you how well in time can track
regular<00:00:13.120> guitar<00:00:13.270> playing<00:00:13.720> and<00:00:13.870> how<00:00:14.320> quickly

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.560 
regular guitar playing and how quickly

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.350 
regular guitar playing and how quickly
you<00:00:14.830> can<00:00:14.950> speed<00:00:15.309> up<00:00:15.340> and<00:00:15.670> slow<00:00:15.730> down<00:00:15.850> during

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
you can speed up and slow down during

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.010 
you can speed up and slow down during
some<00:00:17.040> now<00:00:18.040> what<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.250> have<00:00:18.310> here<00:00:18.790> is<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:19.599> regular

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
some now what I have here is a regular

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.930 
some now what I have here is a regular
electric<00:00:20.230> guitar<00:00:20.650> that's<00:00:20.890> been<00:00:21.130> fit<00:00:21.340> with<00:00:21.820> the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
electric guitar that's been fit with the

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.790 
electric guitar that's been fit with the
MIDI<00:00:22.119> pick<00:00:22.360> up<00:00:22.510> you<00:00:23.080> can<00:00:23.199> get<00:00:23.320> these<00:00:23.410> from<00:00:23.680> a

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
MIDI pick up you can get these from a

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.740 
MIDI pick up you can get these from a
variety<00:00:24.039> of<00:00:24.220> different<00:00:24.330> manufacturers<00:00:25.330> for

both electric and acoustic guitars and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.000 
both electric and acoustic guitars and
they'll<00:00:27.550> all<00:00:27.730> work<00:00:27.940> within<00:00:28.180> time<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.560> output

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
they'll all work within time the output

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.070 
they'll all work within time the output

live<00:01:17.830> looping<00:01:18.100> software<00:01:18.670> I've<00:01:19.660> got<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> simple

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
live looping software I've got a simple

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.800 
live looping software I've got a simple
drum<00:01:20.590> loop<00:01:20.770> set<00:01:21.009> up<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.310> sounds<00:01:21.580> like<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:24.810> now

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
drum loop set up it sounds like this now

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.930 
drum loop set up it sounds like this now
this<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.289> going<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.740> change<00:01:26.770> tempo<00:01:27.429> within

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
this is going to change tempo within

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.940 
this is going to change tempo within
time<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.720> looping<00:01:29.229> software<00:01:29.560> takes<00:01:29.679> care<00:01:29.920> of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
time the looping software takes care of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.499 
time the looping software takes care of
all<00:01:30.099> the<00:01:30.220> time<00:01:30.399> stretching<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.060> you'll<00:01:31.240> hear

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
all the time stretching so you'll hear

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.300 
all the time stretching so you'll hear
the<00:01:31.690> loop<00:01:32.080> speed<00:01:32.410> up<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.709> slow<00:01:32.800> down<00:01:32.920> without

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
the loop speed up and slow down without

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.859 
the loop speed up and slow down without
any<00:01:33.580> pitch<00:01:33.789> changes<00:01:34.209> it<00:01:34.390> will<00:01:34.450> sound<00:01:34.599> a<00:01:34.720> lot

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
any pitch changes it will sound a lot

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.620 
any pitch changes it will sound a lot
like<00:01:34.929> a<00:01:35.110> like<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.679> natural<00:01:36.099> drummer<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.630> in

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
like a like a natural drummer and in

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.089 
like a like a natural drummer and in
time<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:37.990> calling<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.319> shots<00:01:38.530> with<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:38.709> tempo

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
time is calling the shots with the tempo

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.010 
time is calling the shots with the tempo
but<00:01:39.789> it's<00:01:39.910> actually<00:01:40.030> following<00:01:40.450> me<00:01:40.660> so<00:01:40.869> I'm

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
but it's actually following me so I'm

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.960 
but it's actually following me so I'm
calling<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.470> shots<00:01:41.709> on<00:01:41.920> my<00:01:42.069> guitar<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.640> a

calling the shots on my guitar and a
looping<00:01:43.270> software<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.840> following<00:01:44.289> me<00:01:45.869> now

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
looping software is following me now

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.109 
looping software is following me now
keep<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.200> mind<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.800> in<00:01:48.220> time<00:01:48.489> does<00:01:48.789> not<00:01:48.910> need
