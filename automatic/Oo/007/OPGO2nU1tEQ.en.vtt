00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
what I noticed to not only the jumper

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.470 
what I noticed to not only the jumper
but<00:00:46.280> getting<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.700> lane<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:46.880> finishing<00:00:47.390> as

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
but getting to the lane and finishing as

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.750 
but getting to the lane and finishing as
well<00:00:47.690> well<00:00:48.470> you<00:00:48.829> know<00:00:48.980> our<00:00:49.070> system<00:00:49.430> provides

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
well well you know our system provides

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.370 
well well you know our system provides
opportunities<00:00:50.390> for<00:00:50.420> Tim<00:00:50.810> and<00:00:50.840> all<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.290> our

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
opportunities for Tim and all of our

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.170 
opportunities for Tim and all of our
players<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.920> get<00:00:52.100> multiple<00:00:52.309> shots<00:00:52.850> from

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
players to get multiple shots from

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.319 
players to get multiple shots from
multiple<00:00:54.050> spots<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:55.100> thought<00:00:55.700> Tim<00:00:55.940> was

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
multiple spots and so I thought Tim was

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.510 
multiple spots and so I thought Tim was
really<00:00:57.020> good<00:00:57.230> in<00:00:57.380> terms<00:00:57.559> of<00:00:57.680> picking<00:00:57.829> up<00:00:58.190> where

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
really good in terms of picking up where

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.010 
really good in terms of picking up where
his<00:00:58.760> shots<00:00:59.000> would<00:00:59.180> come<00:00:59.390> from<00:00:59.660> where<00:00:59.899> the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
his shots would come from where the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.530 
his shots would come from where the
opportunities<00:01:00.590> will<00:01:00.800> be<00:01:01.090> being<00:01:02.090> aggressive

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
opportunities will be being aggressive

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.110 
opportunities will be being aggressive
out<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.930> floor<00:01:03.200> and<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:04.070> thought<00:01:04.250> he<00:01:04.400> gave

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
out on the floor and I thought he gave

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.640 
out on the floor and I thought he gave
an<00:01:05.269> honest<00:01:05.540> effort<00:01:05.690> on<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.020> defensive<00:01:06.470> end

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
an honest effort on the defensive end

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.649 
an honest effort on the defensive end
that's<00:01:07.520> an<00:01:07.640> area<00:01:07.820> where<00:01:07.940> he'll<00:01:08.360> have<00:01:08.570> to

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
that's an area where he'll have to

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.180 
that's an area where he'll have to
improve<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.110> our<00:01:09.229> entire<00:01:09.470> team<00:01:09.740> will<00:01:09.979> have<00:01:10.070> to

improve in our entire team will have to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.440 
improve in our entire team will have to
be<00:01:10.310> much<00:01:10.520> better<00:01:10.700> than<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.090> have

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
be much better than we have
