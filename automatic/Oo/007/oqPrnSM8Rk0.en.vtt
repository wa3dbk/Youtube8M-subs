00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.199

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.969
hi I'm Kelsey Mays for cars dot com and
this is the 2008 Infiniti g35 sedan

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.000
now the g35 is actually redesign for
2007

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.170
but in the past year some its
competitors have really improved so

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.650
we're gonna see how this car stacks up

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.640
and this me I'm gonna take you through
some other geez standing attributes

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.039
check out our other video to see how it
drives

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.060
and she really looks the part in the
premium sedan it kinda embraces the fact

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.060
that it's from Japan

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.440
there's very little straight lines are
angles there's a lot more curves going

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.969
on here

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.410
Joe 2 I'll definitely return to the New
York Yankees before you see elseif

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.539
headlights like this on an Audi or BMW

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.350
their locker room going on around the
window sills hear the bell I kinda rises

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.920
gently is a good start the trunk

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.589
I we actually think the tail lights here
what are the best executed among

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.589
Phillies lineup

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.620
a test cars at the 35 assets a sportier
addition

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.370
I mean that as 18-inch wheels a little
bit a lower body work across cars this

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.579
class the g35 is a pretty small truck in
fact it's a little bit small in the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.299
truck in a Ford Focus which is a pretty
small car

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.780
oMG there's also pretty high left over
for luggage and part in the space years

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.220
blocked by a CD changer

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.810
inside is really no holding back a g35
snug cabin I'm about six feet tall and I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.030
the seat all the way lowered to its
lowest position

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.410
with the center if you can see there's
not a whole lot had a month over in the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.060
cockpit is very purposeful tell all my
life to it then the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.460
BMW 3 Series inside but on is not

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
as high a luxury question here say the
new Cadillac CTS or even an Acura TL

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.110
very sparse a person things the seats
are kinda tough and uncompromising I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.600
meant to hold you in place on out

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.470
winding road on the seat heaters take a
little bit of time to do their thing

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.660
and couplers basically is over sessions
here behind them

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.420
one nice thing is that they're pretty
low actually so if you put a travel mug

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.590
here it's not an interview that much
with your shifting

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.120
we're big fans this navigation system
some other graphics we've seen

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.310
better graphics and other cars but as
far as usability goes

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.730
it's pretty hard to be it starts with a
backup camera here actually at

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.740
shows tracks a where your bumpers kinda
line up to that's pretty common what's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.380
less common

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.350
is it that as you move the steering
wheel in turn the car this so whatever

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.760
your car's gonna go actually

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.580
changes as well kinda show you where
you're gonna go unfortunately you do

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.550
have to pay for the navigation system to
get the backup camera

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.889
some cars these days are offering a
stand-alone and less expensive backup

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:17.450
camera

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.180
navigation system itself has a touch
screen interface what schools are theirs

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.989
and the is all these shortcut buttons
here

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.810
including buttons to zoom in zoom out
and to move directionally along

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.680
the map itself another bonus but when
you go to radio stations that allows you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.159
to program

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.959
am/fm and XM satellite stations into the
same six preset

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.120
lot of other cars much more expensive
ones don't allow that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.090
the back seat is a equally snug I'm
kinda maxed out I had a right here fire

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.719
driving that's right have the carseat

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.040
as you can see my knees are just about
touching it there is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.689
no folding backseat I'm a lot of sports
and don't have one

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.829
there is a small center passing for skis
and

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.769
that might fit one set of skis to the
g35 is definitely a premium car it's not

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.469
as luxurious say as the new CTS but it
definitely feels more inviting than the

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.689
3 series or even the mercedes c-class

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.609
what sets it apart is value yet
automatic climate control leather power

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.900
seats all standard for karla cost around
32,000 dollars for that serve a quick

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.129
min

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.590
you're gonna have to go to one of the
low entry series a c-class miles and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.379
those really have a lot more so than go

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.329
so if you're in the market for those
make sure you check out one of these

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:22.840
first

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.450

or any other
