towards<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.540> middle<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:52.140> underneath<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
towards the middle go underneath I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.439 
towards the middle go underneath I
wanted<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.979> be<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.159> each<00:00:53.280> side<00:00:56.119> then<00:00:57.119> you<00:00:57.299> can

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
wanted to be on each side then you can

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.759 
wanted to be on each side then you can
take<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:57.839> time<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:59.600> secure<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.720> model<00:01:01.080> onto

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
take some time to secure the model onto

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:02.359 
take some time to secure the model onto
the<00:01:01.949> hook

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
the hook

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.670 
the hook
you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.210> wrap<00:01:03.360> back<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.690> few<00:01:03.989> more<00:01:04.140> times<00:01:04.199> but

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you can wrap back a few more times but

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
you can wrap back a few more times but
for<00:01:05.420> demonstration<00:01:06.420> purposes<00:01:06.900> we'll<00:01:07.080> go

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for demonstration purposes we'll go

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.160 
for demonstration purposes we'll go
ahead<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.560> skip<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.869> now<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.110> gonna

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
ahead and skip that now what we're gonna

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.160 
ahead and skip that now what we're gonna
do<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> we're<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.680> take<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> mono<00:01:12.170> we're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
do is we're gonna take that mono we're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.630 
do is we're gonna take that mono we're
gonna<00:01:13.260> take<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> eye<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.490> got

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
gonna take it up to the eye now we got

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
gonna take it up to the eye now we got
to<00:01:14.730> be<00:01:14.790> careful<00:01:15.080> how<00:01:16.080> tight<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.950> close<00:01:17.160> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to be careful how tight we close this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.670 
to be careful how tight we close this
loop<00:01:17.550> if<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:17.880> close<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:18.300> too<00:01:18.450> tight<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.410> see

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
loop if I close it too tight you can see

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.790 
loop if I close it too tight you can see
it<00:01:20.490> goes<00:01:20.670> above<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.330> point<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.500> hook<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
it goes above the point of the hook I

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.790 
it goes above the point of the hook I
want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.010> keep<00:01:23.160> this<00:01:23.340> loop<00:01:23.810> below<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.590> point

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
want to keep this loop below the point

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.920 
want to keep this loop below the point
of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> hook<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.270> gonna<00:01:27.420> take<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.690> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
of the hook so I'm just gonna take it to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.570 
of the hook so I'm just gonna take it to
capture<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.980> captured<00:01:29.430> it's

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
capture it and then when I captured it's

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.100 
capture it and then when I captured it's
gonna<00:01:29.760> be<00:01:29.940> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.420> side<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> hook

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
gonna be kind of on the side of the hook

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.320 
gonna be kind of on the side of the hook
I<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.280> same<00:01:35.460> exact<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:35.910> on<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
I do the same exact thing on the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.730 
I do the same exact thing on the
southern<00:01:36.660> one<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:37.320> sure<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
southern one and I just make sure that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.310 
southern one and I just make sure that
the<00:01:38.540> mono<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:40.520> loops<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.760> even<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:43.140> want

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the mono is loops are even I don't want

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.180 
the mono is loops are even I don't want
them<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.620> different<00:01:46.880> different<00:01:47.880> lengths

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
them to be different different lengths

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.350 
them to be different different lengths
and<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.250> could<00:01:50.430> trim<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.790> mono<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and you could trim out the mono of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.030 
and you could trim out the mono of
course<00:01:52.100> clean<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.370> up

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.060 

this<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.160> a<00:02:00.190> great<00:02:00.460> weed<00:02:00.820> guard<00:02:01.120> for<00:02:01.650> mice<00:02:02.650> as

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
this is a great weed guard for mice as

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.620 
this is a great weed guard for mice as
well<00:02:03.340> he<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.730> actually<00:02:04.000> throw<00:02:04.270> them<00:02:04.420> on<00:02:04.540> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
well he can actually throw them on to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.720 
well he can actually throw them on to
the<00:02:04.690> bank<00:02:04.870> drag<00:02:05.860> them<00:02:06.040> off<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.520> week

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.740 
the double weed guard a little more
difficult<00:02:25.000> than<00:02:25.030> some<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> other<00:02:25.540> ones

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
difficult than some of the other ones

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.680 
difficult than some of the other ones
but<00:02:26.310> probably<00:02:27.310> one<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> more<00:02:27.730> sturdy<00:02:28.150> weed

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.940 
but probably one of the more sturdy weed
guards<00:02:30.870> that's<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.080> there<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> double

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
guards that's all there is to the double

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.030
