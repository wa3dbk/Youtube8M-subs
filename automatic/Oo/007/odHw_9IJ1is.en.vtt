00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
channel the den um at least I think

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220 
channel the den um at least I think
that's<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.210> called<00:00:51.239> we've<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that's what it's called we've got but it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.510 
that's what it's called we've got but it
