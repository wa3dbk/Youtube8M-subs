00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
these weird patterns on here and this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
these weird patterns on here and this
can<00:01:38.430> flex<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.649> got<00:01:43.740> this

can flex like this and then we got this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.700 
can flex like this and then we got this
tale<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.610> made<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> bunch<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> these<00:01:45.270> like

two little spikes on them and it kind of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.060 
two little spikes on them and it kind of
flops<00:01:52.020> around<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.470> lot<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.649> you're<00:01:52.860> playing
