00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
awful decision and known this guy being

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940 
awful decision and known this guy being
quite<00:02:37.060> cheap<00:02:37.390> he<00:02:38.260> went<00:02:38.410> straight<00:02:38.680> down<00:02:38.709> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
middle I was too naive to tell that he

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.650 
middle I was too naive to tell that he
was<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.860> yeah<00:02:45.540> from<00:02:46.540> this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500

minutes<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.250> he<00:02:54.250> broke<00:02:54.430> through<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:54.760> defense

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
minutes and he broke through my defense

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.000 
minutes and he broke through my defense
and<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:56.019> was<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.170> nice<00:02:56.350> finish<00:02:56.650> from<00:02:56.769> Tony

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
and that was a nice finish from Tony

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.590 
and that was a nice finish from Tony
I'll<00:02:57.310> give<00:02:57.549> him<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.170> so<00:03:00.060> yeah<00:03:01.060> another

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
I'll give him that and so yeah another

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.770 
I'll give him that and so yeah another
penalty<00:03:01.959> for<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.860> which<00:03:03.730> i'm<00:03:04.390> not<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
penalty for that which i'm not going to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.600 
penalty for that which i'm not going to
show<00:03:04.870> replay<00:03:05.290> off<00:03:05.440> because<00:03:05.680> i<00:03:05.799> was<00:03:05.890> disgusting

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
show replay off because i was disgusting

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.080 
show replay off because i was disgusting
how<00:03:06.850> somebody<00:03:07.660> could<00:03:07.900> get<00:03:08.079> penalty<00:03:08.530> for<00:03:08.769> that

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
how somebody could get penalty for that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.759 
how somebody could get penalty for that
but<00:03:10.090> knowing<00:03:10.630> his<00:03:10.750> cheap<00:03:10.959> tactics<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.590> thought

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
but knowing his cheap tactics I thought

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.069 
but knowing his cheap tactics I thought
he'd<00:03:11.980> go<00:03:12.100> down<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> middle<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.750> didn't<00:03:13.989> move

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
he'd go down the middle so I didn't move

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.819 
he'd go down the middle so I didn't move
my<00:03:14.260> goalkeeper<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.519> an<00:03:15.610> easy<00:03:15.730> safe<00:03:16.120> and

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
my goalkeeper and it's an easy safe and

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.370 
my goalkeeper and it's an easy safe and
from<00:03:17.829> there<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.370> defended<00:03:18.959> well<00:03:19.959> enough<00:03:20.230> to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
from there on I defended well enough to

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.199 
from there on I defended well enough to
secure<00:03:20.680> myself<00:03:20.859> for<00:03:21.220> draw<00:03:21.430> against<00:03:21.970> somebody

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
secure myself for draw against somebody

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.770 
secure myself for draw against somebody
that<00:03:22.510> had<00:03:22.630> quite<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.190> strong<00:03:24.190> team<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.820> built

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
series a nice pretty kick in the box I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.260 
series a nice pretty kick in the box I
usually<00:04:54.080> would<00:04:54.229> shoot<00:04:54.470> but<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:55.070> don't<00:04:55.729> trust<00:04:56.000> it

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
usually would shoot but I don't trust it

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.730 
usually would shoot but I don't trust it
this<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.139> team<00:04:57.409> not<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.340> best<00:04:58.639> so<00:04:59.389> I

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.040 

got<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.160> good<00:05:02.310> girl<00:05:02.490> there<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:02.940> later<00:05:03.720> on<00:05:03.960> in

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
got a good girl there and later on in

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.059 
got a good girl there and later on in
the<00:05:04.139> game<00:05:04.169> with<00:05:04.620> Roberto<00:05:06.440> pretty<00:05:07.440> nice<00:05:07.650> finish

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
the game with Roberto pretty nice finish

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.550 
the game with Roberto pretty nice finish
but<00:05:08.430> my<00:05:08.940> goalkeeper<00:05:09.509> isn't<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.960> best<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.470> I'm

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
but my goalkeeper isn't the best and I'm

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.110 
but my goalkeeper isn't the best and I'm
hoping<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:11.069> get<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.280> different<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:11.729> in<00:05:11.849> a<00:05:11.910> pack

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
hoping to get a different one in a pack

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.839 
hoping to get a different one in a pack

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
so 21 2 him 24 minutes I thought this

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.610
