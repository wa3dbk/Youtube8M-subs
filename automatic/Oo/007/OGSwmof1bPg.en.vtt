now<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.730> boots<00:02:44.000> okay<00:02:44.180> as<00:02:44.510> well<00:02:44.690> if<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.200> look

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
now the boots okay as well if you look

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.070 
now the boots okay as well if you look
at<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.560> raw<00:02:45.940> volume<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:47.660> as<00:02:47.780> big<00:02:47.959> as

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
at this raw volume it's not as big as

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.320 
at this raw volume it's not as big as
you<00:02:48.200> find<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.800> an<00:02:48.920> a8<00:02:49.070> or<00:02:49.519> an<00:02:49.670> s-class<00:02:49.970> or

you find in an a8 or an s-class or

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.910 
you find in an a8 or an s-class or
something<00:02:50.600> like<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.780> but<00:02:51.440> because<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.830> a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
something like that but because it's a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.620 
something like that but because it's a
hatch<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.489> because<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> rear<00:02:53.060> seats<00:02:53.330> just

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630

fold at the drop of a button it's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.009 
fold at the drop of a button it's
surprisingly<00:02:55.790> useful<00:02:56.030> Ashley<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.660> think<00:02:56.690> you

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
surprisingly useful Ashley I think you

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.509 
surprisingly useful Ashley I think you
could<00:02:57.230> get<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.620> couple<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.980> sets<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.310> golf<00:02:58.400> clubs

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
could get a couple of sets of golf clubs

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.640 
could get a couple of sets of golf clubs

length ways you can get skis through or

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that nice normally aspirated I think it

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.810 
that nice normally aspirated I think it
just<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.320> revs<00:03:27.829> out<00:03:28.070> really<00:03:28.519> cleanly

but<00:03:33.700> what's<00:03:33.820> particularly<00:03:34.270> nice<00:03:34.570> about<00:03:34.900> it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.900 

is<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.960> in<00:03:38.320> with<00:03:38.530> all<00:03:38.650> there<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.520> seems<00:03:39.790> to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
is that in with all there it seems to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.970 
is that in with all there it seems to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
extra sense of maturity the ride is

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.390 
extra sense of maturity the ride is
there<00:03:44.050> but<00:03:44.200> also<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.560> steering<00:03:45.010> is<00:03:45.130> freer

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.320 
over bumps what it feels to me like is
the<00:03:59.590> difference<00:03:59.980> between<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.700> v12<00:04:01.180> Vantage

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
the difference between the v12 Vantage

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.050 
the difference between the v12 Vantage
and<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.990> v8<00:04:02.230> Vantage<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.430> v12<00:04:03.850> is

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
and the v8 Vantage is that the v12 is

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.330 
and the v8 Vantage is that the v12 is
not<00:04:04.240> only<00:04:04.450> faster<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.320> also<00:04:05.590> more<00:04:05.950> mature

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
not only faster it's also more mature

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.330 
not only faster it's also more mature
and<00:04:06.700> refined<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.840> has<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.740> have<00:04:08.860> kind<00:04:09.130> of<00:04:09.220> done

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and refined and has to have kind of done

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.950 
and refined and has to have kind of done
the<00:04:09.490> same<00:04:09.670> again<00:04:09.940> with<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.450> quality<00:04:10.660> has

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
the same again with this the quality has

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.110 
the same again with this the quality has
taken<00:04:11.290> another<00:04:11.590> notch<00:04:11.890> up<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.460> it's<00:04:12.640> not<00:04:12.910> just

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
taken another notch up and it's not just

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.330 
taken another notch up and it's not just
in<00:04:13.300> cabin<00:04:13.630> material<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.260> feels<00:04:14.560> throughout

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
in cabin material it feels throughout

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:25.420 
in cabin material it feels throughout
the<00:04:15.490> whole<00:04:15.640> dynamic<00:04:16.090> experience

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
so what if we learned well this isn't as

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.909

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
and you know what it doesn't matter yes

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.710 
and you know what it doesn't matter yes
the<00:04:34.130> repeat<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.639> luxury<00:04:35.000> saloon<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:35.539> it<00:04:35.630> is
