problem like I said that the washer

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.640 
problem like I said that the washer
supposedly<00:00:57.240> comes<00:00:57.480> loose<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> left<00:00:58.290> blade

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.440 
the motor
it's<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.660> underpowered<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:24.240> kind<00:02:24.420> of

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
it's just underpowered it's kind of

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.980 
it's just underpowered it's kind of
weird<00:02:24.690> because<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:26.070> power<00:02:26.340> with<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> blade

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
weird because the power with the blade

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.540 
weird because the power with the blade
speed<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.950> problem<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:32.040> know<00:02:32.160> it's

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
speed is the problem so you know it's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.060 
speed is the problem so you know it's
weird<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.780> power<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.680> lower

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
weird because the power the the lower

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.100 
weird because the power the the lower
power<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.820> motor<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.450> doesn't<00:02:36.780> affect

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
power on this motor it doesn't affect

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.050 
power on this motor it doesn't affect
the<00:02:37.440> speed<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.190> mean<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.730> thing<00:02:38.910> is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the speed of it I mean this thing is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.080 
the speed of it I mean this thing is
fast<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.800> got<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> torque<00:02:41.610> going<00:02:41.820> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
fast if they got all the torque going to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.910 
fast if they got all the torque going to
like<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.810> propelled<00:02:43.200> system<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
like the the propelled system the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.410 
like the the propelled system the
self-propelled<00:02:44.310> system<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.910> personal<00:02:45.270> pay

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
self-propelled system the personal pay

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.640 
self-propelled system the personal pay
system<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.790> blade<00:02:48.240> speed<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.750> you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
system but the blade speed is just you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.310 
system but the blade speed is just you
know<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.980> see<00:02:50.700> myself<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.270> over<00:02:51.570> spots<00:02:51.840> you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
know I see myself going over spots you

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.730 
know I see myself going over spots you
know<00:02:52.410> two<00:02:52.470> times<00:02:52.950> three<00:02:53.370> times<00:02:53.400> two<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:55.560> get<00:02:55.709> a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
know two times three times two to get a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.680 
know two times three times two to get a
cut<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.370> way<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.570> way<00:02:57.660> I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
cut the right way and you know the way I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.570 
cut the right way and you know the way I
like<00:02:57.959> but<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.120> think<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.959> 190<00:03:01.530> CC<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
like but you know I think a 190 CC you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.940 
like but you know I think a 190 CC you
know<00:03:02.700> 8.75<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> got<00:03:04.770> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
know 8.75 is just you know you got to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.340 
know 8.75 is just you know you got to
two<00:03:05.340> blades<00:03:05.640> running<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.170> enough

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
two blades running it's just not enough

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.220 
two blades running it's just not enough
power<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:09.180> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.660> know<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:10.050> they

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
power for it so if you know if they

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.720 
power for it so if you know if they
updated<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.770> engine<00:03:11.070> give<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.490> little<00:03:11.610> more

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
updated the engine give it a little more

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.090 
updated the engine give it a little more
power<00:03:11.970> it'd<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> pretty<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.740> know<00:03:13.770> decent

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
power it'd be a pretty you know decent

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.580 
power it'd be a pretty you know decent
mower<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.610> know<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.260> said<00:03:16.320> for<00:03:16.440> a
