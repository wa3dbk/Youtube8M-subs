00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
thing is with the touch screen like you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
thing is with the touch screen like you
can<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.980> other<00:00:47.129> phone<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> turn<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and it turns with you so it has that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.020 
and it turns with you so it has that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so if you're playing a game or being a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580 
so if you're playing a game or being a
good<00:00:59.280> picture<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:01.020> monitoring<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
good picture for just monitoring the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.910 
good picture for just monitoring the
phone<00:01:01.739> anyway<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:03.690> does<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> moves

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
phone anyway it does that and it moves

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
phone anyway it does that and it moves
the<00:01:04.979> picture<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the picture with you so it's not like a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.179 
the picture with you so it's not like a
four<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.409> three<00:01:07.439> repaired<00:01:08.130> actually<00:01:10.189> suppose

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
four by three repaired actually suppose

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.980 
four by three repaired actually suppose
it<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.430> pick<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.790> phone<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.630> thus

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it will pick you up phone and thus

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
it will pick you up phone and thus
arises<00:01:13.140> album<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.400> smooth<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> front

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
arises album it's smooth like the front

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
arises album it's smooth like the front
screen<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.470> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> same<00:01:17.119> picture

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
a good case it's pretty much weight as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.499

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.920 
you're running here you're working out
or<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:44.090> carrying<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.149> around<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.780> day

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
or just carrying it around on your day

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
or just carrying it around on your day
to<00:01:45.990> day<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.590> first<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.240> heavy

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
to day in your first it's not so heavy

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
to day in your first it's not so heavy
it's<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:49.140> lighter<00:01:49.409> than<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.860> phone

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's actually lighter than my phone

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
it's actually lighter than my phone
right<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
right now so I think it because of the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
right now so I think it because of the
pasta<00:01:54.149> ground<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.170> metal

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
pasta ground there it is kind of metal
