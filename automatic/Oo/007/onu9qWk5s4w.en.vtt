always had like two passions and in my

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.389 
always had like two passions and in my
youth<00:01:40.149> one<00:01:40.960> was<00:01:41.140> coffee<00:01:41.320> tea<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.830> course<00:01:42.100> and

youth one was coffee tea of course and

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.460 
youth one was coffee tea of course and
the<00:01:42.820> other<00:01:42.970> one<00:01:43.119> was<00:01:43.330> calligraphy<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.200> mean

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
the other one was calligraphy I mean

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.359 
the other one was calligraphy I mean
they're<00:01:44.710> too<00:01:45.340> far<00:01:45.640> apart<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.960> still<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
they're too far apart but still like the

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.960 
they're too far apart but still like the
graffiti<00:01:48.790> stuff<00:01:49.450> took<00:01:49.840> over<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.500> lot<00:01:50.970> recently

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
graffiti stuff took over a lot recently

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.450 
graffiti stuff took over a lot recently
like<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.450> couple<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.110> years<00:01:53.290> five<00:01:53.590> years<00:01:53.619> ago<00:01:54.100> I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
like a couple of years five years ago I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.900 
like a couple of years five years ago I
was<00:01:54.729> about<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.600> turn<00:01:55.780> 40<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.580> felt<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.729> was<00:01:57.850> time

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
was about to turn 40 I felt it was time

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.219 
was about to turn 40 I felt it was time
to<00:01:58.450> go<00:01:58.959> back<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.530> other<00:01:59.740> passion<00:02:00.429> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to go back to that other passion and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.550 
to go back to that other passion and
sort<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.399> maybe<00:02:03.399> combine<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.390> my<00:02:04.780> other<00:02:04.990> you

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
sort of maybe combine it to my other you

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.550 
sort of maybe combine it to my other you
know<00:02:05.649> my<00:02:05.830> roots<00:02:06.069> and<00:02:06.850> yeah<00:02:07.690> that's<00:02:08.229> where

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
know my roots and yeah that's where

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.150 
know my roots and yeah that's where
calligraphy

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
calligraphy

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:30.040 
calligraphy
originated

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.260 

what<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.170> Kelly<00:02:31.410> graffiti<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:32.270> pretty

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
what is Kelly graffiti it's pretty

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
what is Kelly graffiti it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.650> combination<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
self-explanatory it's a combination of

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.360 
self-explanatory it's a combination of
CV<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.240> category<00:02:36.960> but<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.730> guess<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:40.590> has<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> lot

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
CV and category but I guess it has a lot

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
CV and category but I guess it has a lot
of<00:02:41.960> contrast<00:02:42.960> in<00:02:43.260> itself

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
of contrast in itself

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.910 
of contrast in itself
I<00:02:43.890> mean<00:02:44.210> calligraphies<00:02:45.210> were<00:02:45.690> usually<00:02:46.320> done

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
I mean calligraphies were usually done

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.540 
I mean calligraphies were usually done
really<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.610> know<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.660> about<00:02:48.780> control

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
really you know it's about control

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.090 
really you know it's about control
neatly<00:02:50.550> writing<00:02:51.270> stuff<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.110> nice<00:02:52.410> girls<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
neatly writing stuff and nice girls and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.270 
neatly writing stuff and nice girls and
everything<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.900> graffitis<00:02:55.100> thought<00:02:56.100> of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
everything and then graffitis thought of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.120 
everything and then graffitis thought of
as<00:02:56.520> being<00:02:56.760> bit<00:02:57.270> wilder<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.470> know<00:02:58.590> drips

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
as being bit wilder and you know drips

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.270 
as being bit wilder and you know drips
and<00:02:59.370> splatters<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.480> stuff<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.740> i<00:03:02.040> actually

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
and splatters and stuff and i actually

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.070 
and splatters and stuff and i actually
think<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> two<00:03:03.240> really<00:03:03.600> go<00:03:03.870> well

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
think that the two really go well

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.700 
think that the two really go well
together

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
together

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.180 
together
I<00:03:04.890> found<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:06.030> contrast<00:03:06.630> within<00:03:07.320> myself<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I found that contrast within myself and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.730 
I found that contrast within myself and
pretty<00:03:08.550> much<00:03:08.670> within<00:03:09.270> everything<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:10.080> all

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
pretty much within everything that all

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.710 
pretty much within everything that all
things<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.460> two<00:03:11.670> sides<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.300> there's<00:03:12.630> a

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
things have two sides and there's a

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.620 
things have two sides and there's a
contrast<00:03:13.170> within<00:03:13.350> everything<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.630> control

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
contrast within everything and control

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.140 
contrast within everything and control
that<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.950> sometimes<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.700> losing

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that you have and sometimes the losing

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.360 
that you have and sometimes the losing
of<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.390> control<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.040> know<00:03:20.160> what

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
of the control that's you know what

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.080 
of the control that's you know what
makes<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.790> telegraphy<00:03:25.310> saying<00:03:26.310> how<00:03:26.700> this

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
makes it telegraphy saying how this

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.290 
makes it telegraphy saying how this
whole<00:03:27.410> upside<00:03:28.410> down<00:03:28.590> tour<00:03:28.860> came<00:03:29.190> about<00:03:29.520> well<00:03:30.270> I

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
whole upside down tour came about well I

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.060 
whole upside down tour came about well I
guess<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.750> started<00:03:31.170> when<00:03:31.230> my<00:03:31.500> group<00:03:31.680> came<00:03:31.890> out

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
guess it started when my group came out

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.050 
guess it started when my group came out
the<00:03:32.280> celica<00:03:32.610> city<00:03:32.820> booked<00:03:33.060> few<00:03:33.720> years<00:03:33.900> ago

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the celica city booked few years ago

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.790 
the celica city booked few years ago
after<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.210> I<00:03:36.510> did<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> lot<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:36.990> good<00:03:37.230> signings

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
after that I did a lot of good signings

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.560 
after that I did a lot of good signings
and<00:03:38.630> visions<00:03:39.630> came<00:03:39.840> from<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.940> most<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.240> US

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
and visions came from it most in the US

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.850 
and visions came from it most in the US
and<00:03:42.840> Europe<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.870> an<00:03:45.870> old<00:03:46.140> friend<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.560> mine

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
and Europe and an old friend of mine

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.750 
and Europe and an old friend of mine
moved<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.370> New<00:03:47.820> Zealand<00:03:47.990> Wow

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
moved to New Zealand Wow

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.860 
moved to New Zealand Wow
she<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:51.570> decided<00:03:52.140> here<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.880> thing<00:03:54.150> on

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
she I decided here to do this thing on

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.170 
she I decided here to do this thing on
the<00:03:55.020> other<00:03:55.050> side<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.650> world<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:56.700> we

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the other side of the world so we

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.140 
the other side of the world so we
figured<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.810> know<00:03:58.370> let's<00:03:59.370> give<00:03:59.940> it<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.120> shot

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
figured you know let's give it a shot

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.660 
figured you know let's give it a shot
and<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:01.530> actually<00:04:01.860> found<00:04:02.100> some<00:04:02.280> really<00:04:02.550> cool

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
and we actually found some really cool

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.000 
and we actually found some really cool
people<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:04.200> other<00:04:04.320> side<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.800> planet

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
people on the other side of the planet

00:04:05.010 --> 00:05:12.050 
people on the other side of the planet
and<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:06.480> went<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.960> so<00:04:07.590> here<00:04:07.950> we<00:04:08.100> are

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.149 

well<00:05:13.060> I<00:05:13.090> would<00:05:13.539> like<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.750> go<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:14.379> get<00:05:14.740> more

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
well I would like to go is to get more

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.879 
well I would like to go is to get more
and<00:05:15.520> more<00:05:16.740> simple

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
and more simple

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.140 
and more simple
I<00:05:17.919> mean<00:05:19.139> simplicity<00:05:20.139> is<00:05:20.349> my<00:05:20.680> aim<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.759> not

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
I mean simplicity is my aim and not

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.529 
I mean simplicity is my aim and not
complexity<00:05:23.110> but<00:05:23.740> I'm<00:05:24.250> exploring<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:25.120> more

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
complexity but I'm exploring the more

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.270 
complexity but I'm exploring the more
abstract<00:05:26.379> language

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
abstract language

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.249 
abstract language
I<00:05:27.310> mean<00:05:27.610> language<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.360> can<00:05:29.050> actually

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
I mean language that you can actually

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.640 
I mean language that you can actually
not<00:05:30.009> read<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:31.000> but<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:32.020> could<00:05:32.199> feel<00:05:32.440> its

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
not read but but you could feel its

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.010 
not read but but you could feel its
language<00:05:32.830> yeah<00:05:33.729> might<00:05:34.030> sound<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.300> Big<00:05:34.449> Bang<00:05:34.659> but

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
language yeah might sound a Big Bang but

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.389 
language yeah might sound a Big Bang but
I<00:05:35.289> guess<00:05:36.099> that's<00:05:36.400> what<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.759> want<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.090> explore
