special summon the Tuner then if you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
special summon the Tuner then if you
have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.840> low<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.350> graveyard<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> can

have a low in your graveyard you can

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.719 
have a low in your graveyard you can
choose<00:01:42.060> him<00:01:42.329> he's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> level<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.439> tuner<00:01:43.829> his

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
choose him he's a level one tuner his

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.940 
choose him he's a level one tuner his
effect<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.899> special<00:01:46.229> someone<00:01:46.350> level<00:01:46.710> for

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
effect it's a special someone level for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
effect it's a special someone level for
lower<00:01:47.159> direct<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> graveyard<00:01:48.420> next

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
lower direct from the graveyard next

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080
