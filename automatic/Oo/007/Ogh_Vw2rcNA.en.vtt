00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 to see if your pc can run these 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.510
 games properly remember that is my 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.510
 opinion so they will not say 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.280
 this tone serves is not my game 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.280
 favorite i'm wasting my time 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.400

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.480
 games and I'll make the other top with those who 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.610

 put number 20 is the horror game 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.550
 newmar creatures 2 is a game where 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.530
 you're a kind of zombie or something like that xd 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.710
 but the good thing about this game is its 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.690
 gameplay you can hit a scare is 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.480
 highly recommended for those who do not 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.430
 own a very good pc also has 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.440
 a variety of monsters and each 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.990
 one with his terrifying personality 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.210
 also in this game you can use 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.490
 pumps and so on at number 19 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.619
 this road rash this one for me is the best 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.750
 game of the playstation since it is of 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.760

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.009

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.790
 very funny insults and when you fall 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.890
 of your motorcycle shout towards sounds like 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 it's a game very, very, very, very 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.600
 recommended to laugh and do 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.720
 racing the game lasts 3 or 4 hours 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.060

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 This is a great game because it mixes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.549
 action and driving is the second 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.370

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.459
 the zombies suddenly appear xd but 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.010
 has a huge variety of weapons the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.680
 game is very very very long which 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.989
 it makes more interesting the only bad thing are 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.110
 its graphics but otherwise it 's very 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.150
 all right 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.019
 at number 14 is 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.510
 Gran Turismo 2 is a racing game 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.000
 where you can customize your cars 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.730
 also buy them and do tests of 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.950
 driving to unlock things is a 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.650
 very good game although its graphics do not 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.350
 but it's good to hang out in the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.720
 position number 13 is 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.760
 32 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.280
 it's a game where fighting battles 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.440
 with different armies is very 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.510
 entertaining and addictive you can build 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.150
 your towns and armies to go to the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.920
 battle in truth this game is very 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.130
 good in position number 12 is word 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.710
 of home 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.470
 this game is very good as it will prove 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.510
 your intelligence the game is that 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.280
 you have to pass those fat balls or 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.170
 I do not know what they are but what I know is that 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.120
 you have to pass a number of balls to 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.310
 a tube so he sucked them and so 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.470
 winning the game at the end is very 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.840
 complicated but you have to youtube to 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.980
 to show you how to pass levels x 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.180
 of what I recommend in the position number 11 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.940
 is wrc 3 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.520
 it's a very rally racing game 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.979
 entertained with variety of cars and 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.169
 landscapes where running has very 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.820
 good graphics and compared to the 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.150
 previous requests a little more than 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.940
 requirements but the game is very good 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.930
 in position number 10 is 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.540
 river san francisco this game will be the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.940
 same driver character 2 but with one 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.790
 new story very entertaining the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.980
 missions are very well do not bore xd and 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.500
 it has very good graphics besides 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.180
 you have a huge city to explore what 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.870
 I recommend xd at number 9 is 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.240
 call of duty 4 known as modern 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.280
 warfare this game simulates wars 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.979
 current and not those of the second war 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.590
 world this game has excellent 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.840
 graphics what I give you against is your 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.110
 durability but otherwise it is a good 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.169
 game in addition to having online mode by the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.470
 duration I leave you in this position in the 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:26.130
 position number 8 this is combat assault 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.740
 This is a good simulator of 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.780
 flight of air wars this game has 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.940
 very good gameplay very good 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.400
 graphics but what leaves it in this no 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.249
 so good is its durability but 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.649
 this game is very entertaining 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:43.600
 good I will leave you with carlos so that 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:47.530

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.390
 Carlos, it's not my job 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:54.100
 number 7 is the gta san andreas 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.220
 this game almost everyone knows him 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.530
 it's a good game in free mode besides 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.960
 have a map with a variety of their 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.130
 graphics are not good but it has a 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.430
 great durability I recommend it xd the 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.330
 position number 6 is 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.850

 good has a great history its 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.040
 graphics are almost real how bad is 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.130
 that asks for a pc from the nasa so that 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.240
 can you play properly I recommend it 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.940
 also at number 5 are 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.160

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.430
 need for speed the run this game is a 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:49.219
 wonderful racing simulator with 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.949
 great variety of car tracks in addition to 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:55.039
 customize your car and the bad is the 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.949
 sensitivity when playing it with hosting but 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.540
 he is also very well in third place 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.690
 is for 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.420
 call of duty black ops' is a good game 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.570

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.570
 tanks its gameplay is almost real its 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.890

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:19.100
 also xd in the second place is for 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:21.440
 the wonderful gta 5 is already going out to 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.320
 the sale but has some graphics 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.570
 too good and playability does not 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.580
 I can count more since I have not 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.370
 played but when it comes out they go to 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:35.139
 buy it but surely ask for more than 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.659
 gta 4 and in the first place is 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.999
 this post is for the game that you 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:42.400
 the more you like to play and the one you think is 

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:46.120
