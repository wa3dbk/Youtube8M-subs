00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.970 
very similar the differences are mainly
in<00:00:38.370> terms<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> innards<00:00:39.739> because<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> has

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
in terms of the innards because it has

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
in terms of the innards because it has
LTE<00:00:41.790> four<00:00:42.270> different<00:00:42.600> bands<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:42.960> the
