00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
but first before you take the timing

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
belt off the serpentine ease belt needs

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.540 
belt off the serpentine ease belt needs
to<00:00:28.000> come<00:00:28.149> off<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.809> if<00:00:29.169> it<00:00:29.290> starts<00:00:29.550> cracking

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
and stuff it's it's a good sign that it

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.139 
and stuff it's it's a good sign that it
needs<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:33.120> serpentine<00:00:34.120> belt<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.850> how<00:00:36.850> do<00:00:36.910> you

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
take the serpentine belt off you ask

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.930 
take the serpentine belt off you ask
well<00:00:40.660> it's<00:00:41.289> pretty<00:00:41.469> simple<00:00:42.539> this<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.730> take

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
well it's pretty simple this you take

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.040 
well it's pretty simple this you take
out<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.269> wheel<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:48.100> is<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.399> shroud<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
out the wheel this is a shroud this

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.279 
out the wheel this is a shroud this
needs<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.440> come<00:00:50.649> off<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.629> once<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.899> take<00:00:53.079> that

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
needs to come off so once you take that

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.810 
needs to come off so once you take that
off<00:00:53.559> you<00:00:54.399> expose<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.800> belt<00:00:57.039> from<00:00:57.249> the<00:00:57.309> bottom

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
off you expose the belt from the bottom

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.069 
off you expose the belt from the bottom
it's<00:00:58.809> also<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.170> good<00:00:59.409> idea<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.659> don't<00:01:01.899> have

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
it's also a good idea if you don't have

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.560 
it's also a good idea if you don't have
a<00:01:02.109> diagram<00:01:02.800> some<00:01:03.219> cars<00:01:03.460> have<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.730> diagram<00:01:04.330> on

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
a diagram some cars have a diagram on

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.270 
a diagram some cars have a diagram on
the<00:01:04.690> side<00:01:04.960> somewhere<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.830> can<00:01:05.980> use<00:01:06.159> the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
the side somewhere and you can use the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.999 
the side somewhere and you can use the
diagram<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:07.060> show<00:01:07.090> how<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.020> belt<00:01:08.439> goes<00:01:08.770> back

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
diagram to show how the belt goes back

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.060 
diagram to show how the belt goes back
on<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.310> pulley<00:01:09.579> if<00:01:10.149> you<00:01:10.869> don't<00:01:11.200> have<00:01:11.439> that<00:01:11.710> I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
on the pulley if you don't have that I

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.600 
on the pulley if you don't have that I
would<00:01:12.490> recommend<00:01:13.619> taking<00:01:14.619> pictures<00:01:15.340> with

once it once it comes off so that this

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.190 
once it once it comes off so that this
here<00:01:30.130> is<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> air<00:01:31.270> conditioning<00:01:31.719> unit<00:01:32.020> that

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
here is the air conditioning unit that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.600 
here is the air conditioning unit that
is<00:01:33.899> power<00:01:34.899> that's<00:01:35.469> the<00:01:35.649> water<00:01:35.829> pump<00:01:36.189> power

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
is power that's the water pump power

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.459 
is power that's the water pump power
steering's<00:01:37.119> right<00:01:37.270> above<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:38.229> right

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
steering's right above it this right

steering's right above it this right
here<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.860> tensioner<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.630> just<00:01:40.810> put<00:01:41.110> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
here is the tensioner so you just put a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.179 
here is the tensioner so you just put a
socket<00:01:42.880> wrench<00:01:43.060> on<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:44.500> tensioner<00:01:44.979> right

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
socket wrench on the tensioner right

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.130 
socket wrench on the tensioner right
there<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.430> pull<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.789> back<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.390> see

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
there and this you pull it back and see

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.450 
there and this you pull it back and see
how<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.409> looses<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.890> tension<00:01:51.219> on<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.369> belt

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
how it looses the tension on the belt

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.249 
how it looses the tension on the belt
and<00:01:51.789> then<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.119> can<00:01:52.270> easily<00:01:52.539> pull<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.049> belt

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
and then you can easily pull the belt

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.660 
and then you can easily pull the belt
right<00:01:53.789> off<00:01:54.789> hopefully<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.420> can<00:01:55.539> see<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.670> see

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
right off hopefully you can see that see

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.040 
right off hopefully you can see that see
that

that

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.600 
that
you<00:01:59.770> pull<00:02:00.010> that<00:02:00.190> back<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:02.110> whole<00:02:02.290> belt

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you pull that back and the whole belt

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.150 
you pull that back and the whole belt
easily<00:02:03.610> comes<00:02:03.850> loose<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.680> is<00:02:05.920> how<00:02:06.100> you

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
easily comes loose so that is how you

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.469 
easily comes loose so that is how you
change<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.210> serpentine<00:02:07.840> belt<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:10.210> two

change the serpentine belt in a two
liter<00:02:10.720> VTEC<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.940> pretty<00:02:13.240> much<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.450> standard

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
liter VTEC there pretty much a standard

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.850 
liter VTEC there pretty much a standard
engine<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:16.060> yeah<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.270> pull<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.780> back<00:02:16.860> easily

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
engine but yeah you pull it back easily
