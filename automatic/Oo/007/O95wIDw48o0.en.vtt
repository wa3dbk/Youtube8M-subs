00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.910 
this little border around the screen
acts<00:01:35.420> as<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> protector<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.500> if<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:36.740> lay<00:01:36.830> your

up<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.330> two<00:01:41.510> layers<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.230> actually<00:01:42.410> not

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
up of two layers but it's actually not

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.100 
up of two layers but it's actually not
really<00:01:42.830> bulky<00:01:43.400> at<00:01:43.490> all<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.970> your<00:01:44.960> phone

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
really bulky at all and your phone

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.740 
really bulky at all and your phone
actually<00:01:45.320> does<00:01:45.740> feel<00:01:45.770> really<00:01:45.980> protected

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750
