 thank you for leaving me and making 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 this series is possible you have the twitter 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.110
 in the description it's worth saying that we're going 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 to explain what the series will consist of 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.730
 many objective what will it be to win 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.350
 first division obviously many like 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.140
 you will win it with bronze equipment 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 not as we win matches every 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.250
 won match means an improvement of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 player that is to say we win the next 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.510
 so we will be able to change asad 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.850
 and by a player of silver bone 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.970
 I also have different positions 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.450
 well you will see it with the passage of 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.160
 matches so let's do like that and I 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.930
 you will ask how you will win first 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.850
 division with the silver team because no 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.490
 when we get the whole team of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.320
 We are going to be able to exchange it for a 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.570
 gold player every time we win a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.370
 party said this if you have any doubt 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.370
 leave me for the comments in the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.680
 I will answer and then how many matches 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.860
 you are going to play in each episode 3 so 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.410
 we are going to give cane to the first one and we are going to 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.780
 see what team we were going to play against and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.290
 you are going to see what I destroy is not going to 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 put as you see ibarbo falcao ménez 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.550
 muriel or a real cheat of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.650
 team that I do not know how it is in tenth 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.050
 division but good and we're going to have to 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.180
 to settle and we are going to have to catch the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 it was a good beating as you see 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.780
 here he puts us with muriel the truth is 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.490
 that was just dedicated to paste the e1 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.400
 triangulated as there you are seeing the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.450
 goals and my defenses hit shit 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.240
 incredible 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.040
 look there as the cago and put ibarbo the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 truth is that my goalkeeper did not help either 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.200
 a lot and its l1 triangulated 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.150
 they were bestial and failed to get a 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.480
 little to the goalkeeper and as you see ibarbo to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.780
 pleasure another second triangle more than not 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.670
 it got tired and falcao my defense that the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.390
 ligaba and falcao that defining 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.480
 clearly I was not going to fail 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.480
 still the truth is that I did not want 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.450
 surrender and look at point of genius I was going 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.850
 to hammer rodríguez and now I was going 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.860
 to get the goal the truth is that a goal 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.260
 of disgust the truth is that this show mommy 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.200
 central magician shooting and pull and look 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.209
 as it enters crying the truth that very 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.340
 No paper that you have to put in like this 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.440
 but the truth is that I did not give up 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.120
 I was going to score another goal very quickly as 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.980
 You see here, look where james takes her 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.200
 Rodriguez as he leaves all 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.050
 defenses I do some skill but walking 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.030
 Jaime Rodriguez is a real beast and 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.390
 that little golden left that has to 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.150
 truth is that rarely fails us 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.980
 we put 4-2 but it was going to be only a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.680
 mirage because there you have that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.350
 triangulated and falcao in that vaseline my 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.780
 goalkeeper was not going to fail the truth is that 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.090
 Uncle only every time I throw 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.280
 enter the goal and as you can see, two 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.200
 goals to put to see what they were 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.090
 equal or that of a strangled and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.830
 goal so we go into the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.200
 next game as you see is a team 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.239
 AC Milan only truth is that 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.720
 pretty clear are last contacts 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.370
 and I have 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.530
 but that was not going to give me many 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.000
 problems as you see there will clear up I 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.550
 he's going to fuck with jaime rodríguez 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.810
 I was threatening that spin verb and looking at what shot 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.360
 with the right that makes an effect 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.280
 pretty weird that makes the ball 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.590
 between and the truth is that your goalie does not 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.020
 it was very good here we have cangas that 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.810
 look how is the hammer rodríguez and 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.480
 that I was going to define with that little lefty 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.280
 problem none and we already put ourselves with 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.960
 2 to 0 but he was going to arrive by the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.050
 band with diaz is going to get rid of my 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.760
 goalkeeper who throws 30 seconds later 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.020
 that it has topped pazzini and goes to 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.760
 put the 2 to 1 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.070
 look here as a band bag pick it up 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.100
 hammers rodríguez to gallo shot maga 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.250
 for gallop strip stick wall tail stick and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.180
 Cole Hamels Rodriguez benefits her 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.610
 quite loose and not spend 3-1 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.520
 bad but good as you know my defense 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.880
 always the Saharawi with a shot 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.370
 pretty bad but my goalie was 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.950
 authentic AIDS because it was worth link and 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.110
 set there active going to locker rooms 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.450
 the player thing that surprised me 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.669
 pretty but good here is going to have the 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.070
 hummer 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.040
 rodríguez Rodríguez ran and defined with 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.199
 that lefty who has this version 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.070
 it shows a real barbarity what 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:58.699
 what cut and we're going to win the third 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.550
 match already and let's change to our 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.970
 first player for the match won and 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.340
 As you can see we're going to get one Amayuca 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.520
 authentic gamer greetings for roots 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.620
 that he loves the truth and nothing and 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.560
 let's go into the last one and 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.990
 third party as you see us 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.210
 against a team of Brazilians all gold 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.010
 again the truth is that it costs me 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.900
 very much play against these teams in 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.570
 tenth division with a bronze team 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.699
 and only with james because it's very 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.340
 difficult but look here like machuca in 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.860
 the reincarnation of fifa 3 and that good 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.110
 right hand I had to watch how you put it 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.599
 the authentic stables and celebrated it to 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.539
 your best hand style for ball area 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.639
 for cangas did not remove the goalkeeper failed 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.750
 Vaseline but was wasp disc and 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.510
 mohamed rodríguez and put the 2 and final 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.830
 2 to 0 that was going to seal the victory 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.530
 as you see 20 and we finish the series with 6 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.720
 points 2 matches won and 1 lost 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.670
 sorry the episode where I was wrong and 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.070
 let's finally change the goalkeeper and 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.530
 with this and we're going to get to the end of 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.690
 team the episode I hope that you 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.400
 have liked this episode to like 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.400
 favorites and see you in goodbye
