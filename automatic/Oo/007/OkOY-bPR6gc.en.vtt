hey<00:00:02.700> um<00:00:04.520> thanks<00:00:05.520> again<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:06.000> all<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.890> things

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
hey um thanks again for all the things

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.419 
hey um thanks again for all the things
for<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.069> comments<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.269> last<00:00:09.480> video

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
for the comments on the last video

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.799 
for the comments on the last video
especially<00:00:11.429> showing<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.269> interest<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.719> this

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
especially showing your interest in this

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.780 
especially showing your interest in this
idea<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.290> people<00:00:13.679> say<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.980> genuine<00:00:14.490> interest

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
idea like people say a genuine interest

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.269 
idea like people say a genuine interest
of<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.389> sort<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.580> I<00:00:19.100> definitely<00:00:20.100> think

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of some sort of you I definitely think

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.830 
of some sort of you I definitely think
it's<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.670> idea<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.180> good<00:00:21.359> idea<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it's a good idea a good idea for a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.250 
it's a good idea a good idea for a
generator<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.619> wasn't<00:00:23.220> sure<00:00:23.720> what<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:25.109> guys

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
generator I wasn't sure what you guys

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.779 
generator I wasn't sure what you guys
were<00:00:25.740> wondering<00:00:28.070> specifically<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.400> i<00:00:29.429> could<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
were wondering specifically so i could I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550 
were wondering specifically so i could I
made<00:00:30.150> some<00:00:30.359> more<00:00:30.510> notes<00:00:30.689> since<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.080> last<00:00:31.260> talked

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
made some more notes since I last talked

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.370 
made some more notes since I last talked
about<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> could<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.550> through<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
about I could like go through and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.119 
about I could like go through and
explain<00:00:34.380> each<00:00:34.770> area<00:00:35.130> bit<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
explain each area bit by bit so the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
explain each area bit by bit so the
general<00:00:38.340> idea<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.960> low<00:00:40.200> gravity

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
general idea is you have a low gravity

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.760 
general idea is you have a low gravity
chamber<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.489> salt<00:00:41.910> water<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.530> bring

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
chamber with salt water that you bring

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
chamber with salt water that you bring
together<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> magnetic<00:00:44.670> current<00:00:45.210> into

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
together with a magnetic current into

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.490 
together with a magnetic current into
the<00:00:45.750> shape<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> sphere<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:48.379> then<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the shape of the sphere and then you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.750 
the shape of the sphere and then you
surround<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:52.039> particularly<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.219> something

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
surround it particularly with something

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
surround it particularly with something
that's<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> absorb<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.379> heat<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.770> gives

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that's going to absorb the heat it gives

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.670 
that's going to absorb the heat it gives
off<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> doesn't<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> super

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
off and it doesn't have to be super

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.500 
off and it doesn't have to be super
close<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.399> because<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> bigger<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> ball

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
close to it because the bigger this ball

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
close to it because the bigger this ball
guess<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> give<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> lots<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.129> lots

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
guess it's going to give a lots and lots

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.830 
guess it's going to give a lots and lots
more<00:01:02.399> heat<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> point<00:01:03.359> where<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> starts

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
more heat up to a point where it starts

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.479 
more heat up to a point where it starts
to<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.049> off<00:01:04.260> less<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> gets<00:01:05.010> bigger<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to get off less as it gets bigger but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.050 
to get off less as it gets bigger but
still<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> give<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:08.060> today

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
still is going to give off so much today

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.420 
still is going to give off so much today
will<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.720> given<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
will be given up a lot more the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.410 
will be given up a lot more the
equations<00:01:11.990> are<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
equations are here some of them just a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.440 
equations are here some of them just a
couple<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.869> try<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.380> sense<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
couple of them try to make sense of a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
couple of them try to make sense of a
volume<00:01:18.450> versus<00:01:19.110> surface<00:01:19.770> area<00:01:20.180> getting<00:01:21.180> an

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
volume versus surface area getting an

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
volume versus surface area getting an
idea<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.840> how<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.170> mean<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.710> means

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
idea of how that mean what that means

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.120 
idea of how that mean what that means
radially<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> radius<00:01:25.220> see<00:01:26.220> volume<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.850> um

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
radially do the radius see volume is um

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
radially do the radius see volume is um
it's<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.400> boring<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.820> seems<00:01:30.170> volume<00:01:31.170> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it's not as boring as it seems volume is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's not as boring as it seems volume is
four-thirds<00:01:31.799> PI<00:01:32.720> multiplied<00:01:33.720> by<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> radius

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
four-thirds PI multiplied by the radius

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.719 
four-thirds PI multiplied by the radius
cubed<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.930> area<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> 4<00:01:37.740> pi<00:01:37.979> x<00:01:38.520> radius

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
cubed and the the area is 4 pi x radius

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630 
cubed and the the area is 4 pi x radius
squared

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.420 

basically<00:01:43.570> as<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.840> gets<00:01:43.990> bigger<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:45.190> takes

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
basically as it gets bigger it takes

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.460 
basically as it gets bigger it takes
more<00:01:45.700> volume<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.180> raise<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.810> surface<00:01:47.170> area

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
more volume to raise the surface area

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:57.570 
more volume to raise the surface area
the<00:01:48.010> same<00:01:48.220> amount<00:01:48.900> um<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:50.800> think<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.830> oh<00:01:56.580> where

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
the same amount um I think so oh where

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580 
the same amount um I think so oh where
to<00:01:57.610> start<00:01:58.090> all<00:01:58.540> right<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:58.960> got<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.500> be

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
to start all right so it's got to be

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.530 
to start all right so it's got to be
sealed<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.190> this<00:02:00.520> casing<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.150> doesn't<00:02:01.450> have

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
sealed this this casing it doesn't have

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.530 
sealed this this casing it doesn't have
to<00:02:01.660> go<00:02:01.750> what<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:01.990> was<00:02:02.350> saying<00:02:02.530> was<00:02:03.420> sorry<00:02:04.420> get

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
to go what I was saying was sorry get

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.560 
to go what I was saying was sorry get
sidetracked<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.700> casing<00:02:07.240> unit

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
sidetracked so this is this casing unit

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.770 
sidetracked so this is this casing unit
that<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.160> would<00:02:09.280> be<00:02:09.780> surrounding

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
that you that you would be surrounding

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.949 
that you that you would be surrounding
the<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.650> star<00:02:12.040> kind<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.520> thing<00:02:12.700> with<00:02:12.880> could<00:02:13.870> be

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
the the star kind of thing with could be

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.420 
the the star kind of thing with could be
very<00:02:14.140> far<00:02:14.350> away<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.800> may<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.190> be<00:02:15.220> very

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
very far away and it may have to be very

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.340 
very far away and it may have to be very
far<00:02:15.730> away<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:15.970> still<00:02:16.270> contain<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.080> can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
far away but still contain it if you can

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.440 
far away but still contain it if you can
because<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:18.130> don't<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> idea<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.060> static

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
because I don't like the idea of static

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
because I don't like the idea of static
energy<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.590> universe<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.370> galaxies<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
energy in the universe and galaxies and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.130 
energy in the universe and galaxies and
I<00:02:21.820> would<00:02:21.970> last<00:02:22.420> thing<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.600> would<00:02:22.660> want<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.989> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
I would last thing I would want is the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.680 
I would last thing I would want is the
Sun<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:24.160> send<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> giant<00:02:24.910> lightning<00:02:25.150> bolt<00:02:25.480> into

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
Sun to send a giant lightning bolt into

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.449 
Sun to send a giant lightning bolt into
this<00:02:25.930> thing<00:02:26.230> because<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.680> wasn't<00:02:26.950> protected

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
this thing because it wasn't protected

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.790 
this thing because it wasn't protected
and<00:02:27.720> insulated<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.530> got<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.680> be

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
and insulated so it's got to be

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.699 
and insulated so it's got to be
insulated<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:31.030> also<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.410> pass

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
insulated but also so you can pass

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.530 
insulated but also so you can pass
electromagnetic<00:02:33.580> frequency<00:02:34.030> through<00:02:34.390> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
electromagnetic frequency through it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.970 
electromagnetic frequency through it
because<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.959> whole<00:02:35.080> point<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.650> send<00:02:35.890> this

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
because the whole point is you send this

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.490 
because the whole point is you send this
you<00:02:36.580> kick<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> magnet<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.570> hold<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.350> place

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
you kick the magnet on hold it in place

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740 
you kick the magnet on hold it in place
in<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.830> middle<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.850> then<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.120> send<00:02:40.360> them<00:02:40.480> you

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
in the middle and then you send them you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.199 
in the middle and then you send them you
turn<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.080> frequency<00:02:41.500> generator<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.150> send<00:02:43.150> a

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
turn the frequency generator on send a

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.520 
turn the frequency generator on send a
current<00:02:43.450> through<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
current through it and it's going to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.320 
current through it and it's going to
ignite<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> give<00:02:46.300> a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
ignite it and it's going to give a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.860 
ignite it and it's going to give a
hydrogen<00:02:47.160> heat<00:02:48.160> which<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.090> about<00:02:49.269> 1,600

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
hydrogen heat which is about 1,600

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.000 
hydrogen heat which is about 1,600
degrees<00:02:49.900> Celsius<00:02:50.500> when<00:02:50.650> measured<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
degrees Celsius when measured in the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.710 
degrees Celsius when measured in the
laboratory<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.670> test<00:02:51.940> tube<00:02:52.030> I'm<00:02:52.329> wondering

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
laboratory in a test tube I'm wondering

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.030 
laboratory in a test tube I'm wondering
if<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.930> giant<00:02:53.140> surface<00:02:53.560> area<00:02:53.709> will<00:02:53.799> actually

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
if a giant surface area will actually

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.120 
if a giant surface area will actually
make<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.340> hotter<00:02:54.519> but<00:02:54.850> probably<00:02:55.750> 100<00:02:56.200> 1,600

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
make it hotter but probably 100 1,600

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.680 
make it hotter but probably 100 1,600
degrees<00:02:57.160> Celsius<00:02:57.700> per<00:02:57.730> cubic<00:02:58.209> inch<00:02:58.329> so<00:02:58.600> you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
degrees Celsius per cubic inch so you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.819 
degrees Celsius per cubic inch so you
know<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.930> get<00:02:59.079> close<00:02:59.230> like<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.799> all

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
know if you get close like you have all

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.150 
know if you get close like you have all
these<00:03:00.190> 1600<00:03:00.850> degree<00:03:01.140> Celsius<00:03:02.140> areas<00:03:02.530> pointing

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
these 1600 degree Celsius areas pointing

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.650 
these 1600 degree Celsius areas pointing
at<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.790> gets<00:03:03.880> kind<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.209> hot<00:03:04.420> um<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:09.660> you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
at you it gets kind of hot um so you

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.170 
at you it gets kind of hot um so you
kick<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.140> frequency<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.739> light<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.730> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
kick the frequency on light it up the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.789 
kick the frequency on light it up the
hydrogen<00:03:13.630> starts<00:03:13.810> giving<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.170> hydrogen<00:03:14.650> and

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
hydrogen starts giving a hydrogen and

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.780 
hydrogen starts giving a hydrogen and
chlorine<00:03:15.070> because<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.000> sodium<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.610> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
chlorine because the sodium and the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.130 
chlorine because the sodium and the
chlorine<00:03:18.880> from<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.360> salt<00:03:20.070> disperse<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:22.140> so

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
chlorine from the salt disperse and so

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.990 
chlorine from the salt disperse and so
chlorine<00:03:23.950> will<00:03:24.220> be<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.400> primary<00:03:24.610> waste

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
chlorine will be the primary waste

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.729 
chlorine will be the primary waste
product<00:03:25.420> here<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.780> had<00:03:25.959> an<00:03:26.049> idea<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.410> could

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
product here so I had an idea you could

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.990 
product here so I had an idea you could
rinse<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.489> solution<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.390> water<00:03:30.000> and

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
rinse it with a solution of water and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.630 
rinse it with a solution of water and
sodium<00:03:31.329> salt<00:03:31.840> water<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.110> sodium<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.400> if

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
sodium salt water and sodium and and if

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.520 
sodium salt water and sodium and and if
you<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.239> proper<00:03:34.690> heat<00:03:34.900> or<00:03:35.140> agitate

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you do that the proper heat or agitate

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.600 
you do that the proper heat or agitate
in<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.680> right<00:03:35.829> way<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.010> might<00:03:36.280> be<00:03:36.400> able<00:03:36.459> to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
in the right way you might be able to

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.039 
in the right way you might be able to
form<00:03:36.880> salt<00:03:37.209> with<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> sodium<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:37.989> chlorine

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
form salt with a sodium and the chlorine

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.970 
form salt with a sodium and the chlorine
that's<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.680> here<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:41.079> then<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.620> would<00:03:41.739> wash

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
that's in here and then you would wash

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.890 
that's in here and then you would wash
it<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.430> then<00:03:42.579> vacuum<00:03:43.000> out<00:03:43.150> however<00:03:43.750> much

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
it and then vacuum out however much

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.690 
it and then vacuum out however much
volume<00:03:44.290> wise<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.769> don't<00:03:44.980> need<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.430> then<00:03:45.519> you

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
volume wise you don't need and then you

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.400 
volume wise you don't need and then you
kick<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.299> magnet<00:03:46.690> on<00:03:46.750> again<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.200> all

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
kick the magnet on again and it's all

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.140 
kick the magnet on again and it's all
going<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.590> just<00:03:47.859> let<00:03:48.040> warp<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.700> middle<00:03:48.970> in

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
going to just let warp to the middle in

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.040 
going to just let warp to the middle in
this<00:03:49.690> spherical<00:03:50.109> form

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
this spherical form

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.390 
this spherical form
hold<00:03:51.320> there<00:03:51.470> for<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.810> um<00:03:53.830> so<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.920> panel's

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
hold there for you um so the panel's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.340 
hold there for you um so the panel's
best<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.970> could<00:03:56.030> come<00:03:56.150> up<00:03:56.330> with<00:03:56.630> are<00:03:56.900> these

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
best I could come up with are these

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.020 
best I could come up with are these
quasi<00:03:57.650> crystals<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.430> are<00:03:58.610> just<00:03:58.850> fantastic

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
quasi crystals that are just fantastic

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.200 
quasi crystals that are just fantastic
solar<00:03:59.720> generators<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.730> mean<00:04:01.730> they<00:04:01.820> really<00:04:02.180> just

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
solar generators I mean they really just

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.420 
solar generators I mean they really just
handle<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:03.050> look<00:04:03.290> up<00:04:03.380> kwasi<00:04:03.620> crystal<00:04:04.280> if<00:04:04.400> you

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
handle they look up kwasi crystal if you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.780 
handle they look up kwasi crystal if you
want<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.760> find<00:04:05.060> out<00:04:05.240> more<00:04:05.270> about<00:04:05.390> them<00:04:05.750> um

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
want to find out more about them um

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.890 
want to find out more about them um
they're<00:04:07.790> really<00:04:08.060> good<00:04:08.210> at<00:04:08.300> taking

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
they're really good at taking

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.740 
they're really good at taking
electricity<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.680> sending<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.980> somewhere<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.750> I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
electricity and sending it somewhere I I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.680 
electricity and sending it somewhere I I
thought<00:04:12.530> maybe<00:04:12.710> lead<00:04:13.040> maybe<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.850> lead<00:04:14.090> casing<00:04:14.600> I

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
thought maybe lead maybe a lead casing I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.910 
thought maybe lead maybe a lead casing I
don't<00:04:14.810> know<00:04:14.870> if<00:04:14.960> leads<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.380> best<00:04:15.590> metal

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
don't know if leads the best metal

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.070 
don't know if leads the best metal
though<00:04:16.130> out<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.910> use<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.360> thing<00:04:17.540> and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
though out to use on this thing and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.020 
though out to use on this thing and
maybe<00:04:18.320> carbon<00:04:18.860> as<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.549> frame<00:04:20.000> at<00:04:20.180> least<00:04:22.030> that

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
maybe carbon as a frame at least that

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.350 
maybe carbon as a frame at least that
it's<00:04:23.210> very<00:04:23.360> durable<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:23.990> flexible<00:04:28.810> spirit

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
it's very durable and flexible spirit

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.030 
it's very durable and flexible spirit
over<00:04:32.360> here<00:04:32.840> then<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.350> started<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.680> make<00:04:33.770> some

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
over here then I started to make some

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.920 
over here then I started to make some
notes<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:38.380> salt<00:04:39.380> water<00:04:39.820> it's<00:04:40.820> all<00:04:41.000> got<00:04:41.240> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
notes and salt water it's all got the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:51.510 
notes and salt water it's all got the
the<00:04:42.260> waste<00:04:42.500> disposal<00:04:42.710> method<00:04:44.950> no<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:47.830> true

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.230 

take<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.610> hit<00:04:52.760> all<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.030> marks<00:04:53.060> um<00:04:55.180> with<00:04:56.180> what

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
take a hit all the marks um with what

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.210 
take a hit all the marks um with what
I've<00:04:56.480> got<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:56.750> far

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.160 

it<00:05:00.820> doesn't<00:05:01.090> have<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.300> be<00:05:01.330> close<00:05:01.600> together<00:05:01.810> it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
it doesn't have to be close together it

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.400 
it doesn't have to be close together it
can<00:05:02.260> be<00:05:02.380> really<00:05:02.560> far<00:05:02.860> spread<00:05:03.160> out<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.340> think<00:05:07.410> so

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
can be really far spread out I think so

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.890 
can be really far spread out I think so
yeah<00:05:08.680> any<00:05:08.920> more<00:05:09.040> questions<00:05:09.520> or<00:05:10.360> ideas<00:05:10.570> or

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
yeah any more questions or ideas or

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.620 
yeah any more questions or ideas or
anything<00:05:11.200> about<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.650> let<00:05:12.400> me<00:05:12.430> know<00:05:12.550> my<00:05:13.390> big

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
anything about it let me know my big

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.300 
anything about it let me know my big
concern<00:05:13.660> right<00:05:14.080> now<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.380> how<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.680> transport

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
concern right now is how to transport

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.900 
concern right now is how to transport
the<00:05:15.460> energy<00:05:15.820> like<00:05:17.190> it's<00:05:18.190> going<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.370> be

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
the energy like it's going to be

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.020 
the energy like it's going to be
producing<00:05:19.510> a<00:05:19.630> lot<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.490> don't<00:05:21.640> know<00:05:21.730> what<00:05:21.910> you

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
producing a lot so I don't know what you

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.630 
producing a lot so I don't know what you
would<00:05:22.150> use<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.440> refract<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.740> if<00:05:23.980> you<00:05:24.100> cause

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
would use to refract that if you cause

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.640 
would use to refract that if you cause
like<00:05:24.790> I<00:05:25.030> keep<00:05:25.720> doing<00:05:25.810> an<00:05:25.930> arc<00:05:26.110> lightning<00:05:26.500> you

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
like I keep doing an arc lightning you

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.560 
like I keep doing an arc lightning you
could<00:05:26.770> use<00:05:26.920> maybe<00:05:27.160> in<00:05:27.400> space<00:05:27.730> would<00:05:28.300> be<00:05:28.330> so

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
could use maybe in space would be so

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.760 
could use maybe in space would be so
dangerous<00:05:28.720> for<00:05:29.080> like<00:05:29.200> on<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.380> earth<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.740> know

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
dangerous for like on the earth you know

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.860 
dangerous for like on the earth you know
it's<00:05:29.980> kind<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.250> then<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.120> maybe<00:05:31.420> we<00:05:31.570> could<00:05:31.690> send

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
it's kind of then I maybe we could send

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.780 
it's kind of then I maybe we could send
lightning<00:05:32.200> bolts<00:05:32.410> into<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.680> ground<00:05:32.920> or

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
lightning bolts into the ground or

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.760 
lightning bolts into the ground or
something<00:05:34.090> like<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.320> but<00:05:35.320> yeah<00:05:35.530> let<00:05:35.680> me<00:05:35.740> know

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
something like that but yeah let me know

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.320 
something like that but yeah let me know
about<00:05:35.980> storage<00:05:36.370> capacity<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.030> could<00:05:37.180> think

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
about storage capacity you could think

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.570 
about storage capacity you could think
of
