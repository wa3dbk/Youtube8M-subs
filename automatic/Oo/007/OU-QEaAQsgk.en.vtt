outdoor photos and do keep in mind the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420 
outdoor photos and do keep in mind the
galaxy<00:00:15.719> s5<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.109> not<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.680> released<00:00:17.130> so

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
galaxy s5 is not actually released so

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400 
galaxy s5 is not actually released so
these<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> photos<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.600> are<00:00:18.840> actually

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
these are the photos that are actually

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.740 
these are the photos that are actually
posted<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:19.980> different<00:00:20.310> sources<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> thought

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
posted on different sources so I thought

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
posted on different sources so I thought
making<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.170> video<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.830> showing<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.400> these

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
making this video of showing you these

result<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> 16<00:00:28.050> mm<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
result so this is the 16 mm it's a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
result so this is the 16 mm it's a
camera<00:00:28.710> result<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.150> 3

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
might see some more and also the galaxy

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.410 
might see some more and also the galaxy
s5<00:02:06.210> huge<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.899> different<00:02:07.439> vibe<00:02:08.129> views<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:09.209> well

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.880 
as 30 maybe soul and 60 mm box of views
and<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.690> also<00:02:12.870> decrease<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.349> resolution

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and you can also decrease the resolution

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.720 
and you can also decrease the resolution
up<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.340> 8<00:02:14.520> megapixel<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.380> Galaxy<00:02:16.950> s3<00:02:17.100> so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
up to 8 megapixel of the Galaxy s3 so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.250 
up to 8 megapixel of the Galaxy s3 so
and<00:02:18.030> also<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:20.240> if<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.600> there<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.959> much

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
and also and if if there is much

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.290 
and also and if if there is much
improvement<00:02:22.740> or<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> comment

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300

improvement or not and you can comment
on<00:02:24.510> below<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:25.260> about<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
on below but you think about the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.730 
on below but you think about the
galaxy's<00:02:26.100> 5<00:02:26.340> photos<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.600> yes<00:02:28.140> according<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.530> me

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
galaxy's 5 photos so yes according to me

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.780 
galaxy's 5 photos so yes according to me
the<00:02:29.250> galaxy<00:02:29.520> s5<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.390> my<00:02:30.570> opinion<00:02:31.080> Galaxy<00:02:31.500> s5

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
the galaxy s5 in my opinion Galaxy s5

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.480 
the galaxy s5 in my opinion Galaxy s5
does<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.390> very<00:02:33.600> great<00:02:33.810> camera<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
does have a very great camera but it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.880 
does have a very great camera but it
disappoints<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.260> no<00:02:37.470> optical

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
disappoints because there is no optical

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.699 
disappoints because there is no optical
image<00:02:38.190> stabilization<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> galaxy<00:02:39.330> s5<00:02:39.709> the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.470 
image stabilization in the galaxy s5 the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
should I put the galaxy s5 the should

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.670 
report in Ohio is in the galaxy s5
because<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.459> very<00:02:48.090> great<00:02:48.480> thing<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.560> the

4 hopefully just hopefully so yes this
may<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.800> be<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> big<00:03:05.250> deal<00:03:05.400> for<00:03:05.459> most<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.060> you

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
may not be a big deal for most of you

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.050 
may not be a big deal for most of you
out<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:07.950> definitely<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> feature

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
out there but it is definitely a feature

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.750 
out there but it is definitely a feature
that<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.750> galaxy<00:03:10.080> s5<00:03:10.320> misses<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:11.010> camera

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that the galaxy s5 misses in camera

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.050 
that the galaxy s5 misses in camera
Department<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.800> yes<00:03:13.800> definitely<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.550> like<00:03:14.940> this
