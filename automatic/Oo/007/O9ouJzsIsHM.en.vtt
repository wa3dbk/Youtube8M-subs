 dear friends forces in home 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.550
 welcome you hurry to share with 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.230
 you news that now on the shelves 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.429
 of our store you can purchase 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.860
 famous knives 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.800
 famous Russian master Igor you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.050
 reach a bomb ear and 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.340
 Kirill Oleg let's come on well 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.039
 started with this bag 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 great let's start so let's say with 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.840
 visual techno entourage from the approach 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.369
 to the sale of these knives and everything is done 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 perfectly with any very beautiful and very 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.550
 I liked that there is no such video 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.399
 comes to us in this form they 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 send you the actual author 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.500
 A bag is pretty simple but 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.379
 succinctly for the author's stamp 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.510
 regulating trampu 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 I will raise the side Mimi here such

 black gift box black 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 boxes which is written the knife should 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 cut it some kind of joke with some

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.280
 Internet response to frequently asked 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.829
 the question is that nails need to cut these 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 here is the crutch on the knife should cut 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 ha ha ha actually open the box 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 inside we see directly the legs in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.820
 Classic such enough 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 traditional leather can be can we 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.070
 see the passport of this knife 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.070
 They say that for the model of this knife passport 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.580
 accordingly that these knives are not 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.380
 weapons classic in principle and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.549
 directly business card their rods and I 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.100
 Yuryevna himself 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 this is the head of sales department two words

 copyright alloy people who are not at all 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.729
 addicted to knives no way even 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.399
 if they are far from Bulat anyway 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.350
 they are named pampuh with you limp of fluff 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.810
 did not come across because the person we have 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.970
 in the country by bulat if not 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 not the very first though someone more 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.320
 the media better known to me for some reason 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 I can now call all that possible 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.770
 I'm stronger than the loot is far enough for 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.660
 me this is basically a new topic for 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.650
 studying is very interesting 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.940
 actually and the heating is 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.410
 armament to the Russian Federation 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.330
 as far as I know it calculated pa 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.180
 pa pa pa pa pa with his knife 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.800
 that is, go into what bulat 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.080
 you come we are with you the evil eye of the state 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.730
 We communicate because these knives sharpen at 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 their mechanical properties you share 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.580
 I will share my experiences 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.950
 knowledge of all this will speak 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.110
 12 words of Damascus steel that has a damask damask 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.970
 there is a certain kind of alloy to which 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.820
 carbon content in excess of 2 percent 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.060
 that is, it is actually iron carbon then 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.840
 there is a chemical composition of it is close to the cast iron 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.820
 if the cast iron is not in structure 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.730
 its fish metal structure 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.500
 steel he still is steel so 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.180
 let's say that is this piece of carbon 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.520
 steel we have represented knives 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.200
 from doped elate bulat 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.200
 bulat is such a kind of golden mean 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.709
 between so let's say carbon damask 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.770
 which bureau bulat they basically 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.890
 quite elastic and hard enough 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.390
 but still carbon was there more 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.980
 rusting and also have a wonderful 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.600
 stainless damask is how much 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.950
 I understand just a certain author's alloy 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.989
 Yuryevich, he is not there at all 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.459
 Corroded Well, no guarantee at all 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.620
 maybe this when you have coals 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.769
 steel more than two percent here 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.000
 actually the structure was something 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.590
 picture if you see here you can see well 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.190
 actually it is clear that the structure was 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.630
 such a rather heterogeneous interesting 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.400
 apparently caused by some kind of crystalline 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.860
 lattice crystallization directly 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.680
 ingot so let's say the same way we see here 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 hardening line, that is, hardened 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.360
 knives edge we for chernichiny still 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.430
 on land that is, it will be firmer 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.410
 its mechanical properties butt with us 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.330
 more viscous and therefore butt Forest 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.150
 some of their statutes are released 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.860
 on the design of knives that is a design 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.140
 quite traditionally it 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.970
 through installation which ends on 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.470
 do not set back on top here 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.270
 epoxy more precisely on epoxy it 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.850
 planted including well on avalanche there on 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.970
 bolt that is basically enough 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.910
 workers 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.430
 workers so let's say the part here 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.220
 Hawaiian error is not worth it for it 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.210
 knife must cut something to draw 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.470
 further attention further 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.450
 regarding some post 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.470
 corrupt there is no such word in general 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.570
 regarding warranty service 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.590
 these knives 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.210
 actually egorievich provides 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.860
 lifetime warranty on your knives 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.750
 accordingly what does not mean that 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.060
 you can cut nails every two 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.440
 weeks send them that he was pulling it 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.090
 still somehow should be 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.440
 realized intended use for wife 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.310
 if you have formed his block 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.440
 some kind of chip 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.320
 If you have any problems for. You do not 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.330
 do not know how to drag him if you 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.370
 some problems with the handle in general 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.350
 any problems associated with 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.600
 directly adequate so let's say 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.010
 knife operation it is all solved 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.740
 by means of here it is business cards 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.419
 which comes with you in 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.860
 complete with a knife respectively all 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.480
 questions please they are solved 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.340
 directly with the master it is direct 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.560
 contact and i like really like 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.940
 this approach he speaks about really 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.100
 such a warm amorous execution and on 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.330
 how does a person treat his job like 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.370
 man refers to what he does 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.690
 if he is ready to discuss with you directly 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.510
 each of these models because they 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.310
 really feet almost single 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.750
 copies because it is author's knives 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.850
 these are author knives from start to finish 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.360
 and starting from casting 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.940
 directly alloy ending so 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.070
 what you don't know there 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.930
 10-15 years from an axon on people communicated 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.850
 send such age knives 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.830
 you will serve these knives 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.380
 actually for some other nuances 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.700
 famous for argue that there I am absolutely 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.270
 traditional stabilized wood 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.660
 whether it is walnut like rosewood whether 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.580
 wenge pretty traditional for 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.190
 some hunting knives 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.730
 her for the forest on the same fishing knives in 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.370
 general who are interested come 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.590
 talk to you in more detail who is not 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:16.230
 interested but come come on 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.240
 we will not communicate in general notes on here 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.100
 See Kirill is not all as they say 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.870
 assortment of all knives when is it necessary 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.010
 This is a small fraction of the fact that to us 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.720
 it came we just decided all the same 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.720
 keep the intrigue taken so in general 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.150
 to cover a little by types 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.090
 handles on just the shape of the blades because 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.440
 that invested in principle more 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.510
 accordingly, any choice is greater but 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.040
 which of these knives in your heart went to you 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.930
 I could have a soul black 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.730
 I would never pay attention to 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.290
 really, by virtue of just geometry 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.880
 probably appearance but when he took 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.790
 in your hand for some reason not so native know 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.470
 seemed precisely by weight by balancing 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.240
 everything else and i'm honestly wild 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.740
 Liked like a man who like with 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.840
 knives somehow connected not only 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.250
 all the things that he sells them and those that do not 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.500
 likes me very much 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.630
 sales approach to making these 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.910
 knives because people are really by this 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.320
 breathes it live and do it 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.300
 not professionally engaged not only 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.160
 stupidly selling them 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.360
 doing research ie igor 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.910
 Yuryevich as far as I know now 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.890
 writing some book on bulat man 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.050
 really really lives it 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.330
 this and interesting and products that 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.660
 what is really interesting 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.010
 warm live living knives 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.420
 show me in the center of ours closer 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.420
 please yes 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.340
 I liked it here with. not worth it 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.410
 in terms of aesthetics when like 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.990
 baby corsac such a floor tit tit 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.520
 dirk me on just a little do not like 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.690
 for the life of a big cross with a big 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.970
 guards oh well what was that small 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.770
 how do you get a preview of what we have 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.340
 New ones arrived at you hot 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.500
 dumplings 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.900
 as they say subscribe to the channel 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.940
 come to visit us at our retail 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.350
