was in budokai tenkaichi 3 is probably
already<00:01:45.540> engaged<00:01:46.159> but<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.399> game<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:48.270> all

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
already engaged but in that game we all

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.899 
already engaged but in that game we all
as<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.689> all<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
as we all know if there was a way to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.719

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
no matter how far you take off from them

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.390 
no matter how far you take off from them
they're<00:02:16.290> always<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.860> tender

connected to you and almost you know

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.770 
connected to you and almost you know
it's<00:02:20.489> like<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.819> almost<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:21.180> playing<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.510> 2-d

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.600 
it's like it's almost like playing a 2-d
game<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:22.709> you're<00:02:22.890> fighting<00:02:23.250> somebody<00:02:23.400> in

backwards<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> don't<00:02:29.610> cut<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> stage<00:02:30.450> off

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
backwards and don't cut the stage off

backwards and don't cut the stage off
from<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.590> what<00:02:31.709> kind<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.890> feels<00:02:32.160> like

from you that what kind of feels like
like<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> said<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.020> noticed<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> demo<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.670> this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
like I said I noticed the demo and this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.600 
like I said I noticed the demo and this
shouldn't<00:02:36.510> affect<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.650> final<00:02:38.190> version<00:02:38.489> of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
shouldn't affect the final version of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.990 
shouldn't affect the final version of
the<00:02:38.670> game<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.160> part<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.670> their<00:02:41.819> new

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the game but if it is part of their new

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720 
the game but if it is part of their new
system<00:02:42.510> that's<00:02:43.230> really<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.610> like

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
system that's really we all really like

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.780 
system that's really we all really like
that<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.930> sometimes<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:47.280> if<00:02:47.400> anybody<00:02:47.700> else

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that and sometimes see if anybody else

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.860 
that and sometimes see if anybody else
notice<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> while<00:02:48.390> they're<00:02:48.540> playing<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
notice that while they're playing the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.309 
notice that while they're playing the
demo<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:50.700> also<00:02:50.970> would<00:02:51.269> explain<00:02:51.630> why<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
demo this also would explain why the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.160 
demo this also would explain why the
camera<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.069> horrible<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.580> demo<00:02:54.170> when

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
camera is so horrible in the demo when

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.600 
camera is so horrible in the demo when
you<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.650> close<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.860> your<00:02:56.069> opponent<00:02:56.220> and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
you get up close to your opponent and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
you get up close to your opponent and
how<00:02:56.940> basically<00:02:57.450> it'll<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:58.170> look<00:02:58.319> over<00:02:58.560> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
how basically it'll just look over you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.340 
how basically it'll just look over you
or<00:02:59.100> through<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.790> him<00:03:00.140> finally<00:03:01.140> it's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
or through you to him finally it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.070 
or through you to him finally it's
really<00:03:01.830> hard<00:03:02.100> trying<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.850> tell<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.420> arenas

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
really hard trying to tell if the arenas

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.430 
really hard trying to tell if the arenas
themselves<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.920> been<00:03:05.160> increased<00:03:05.549> in<00:03:05.700> size

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
themselves have been increased in size

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.690 
themselves have been increased in size
even<00:03:07.440> though<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.709> stages<00:03:08.010> look<00:03:08.160> very<00:03:08.370> fast

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
even though the stages look very fast

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.660 
even though the stages look very fast
and<00:03:09.150> huge<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:10.290> boundaries<00:03:11.100> blend<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.549> with

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and huge the boundaries blend in with

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.580 
and huge the boundaries blend in with
the<00:03:11.760> graphics<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.870> never<00:03:12.989> tell<00:03:13.290> when

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the graphics so you can never tell when

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.710 
the graphics so you can never tell when
you're<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.860> hit<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> wall<00:03:14.280> until<00:03:14.720> you

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
you're going to hit the wall until you

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.500 
you're going to hit the wall until you
do<00:03:15.900> at<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.650> same<00:03:16.890> time<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.430> seemed<00:03:17.910> like<00:03:18.090> key

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
do at the same time it seemed like key

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
do at the same time it seemed like key
blasters<00:03:18.989> don't<00:03:19.290> reach<00:03:19.440> console<00:03:19.680> stays<00:03:19.950> like

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
blasters don't reach console stays like

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.520 
blasters don't reach console stays like
they<00:03:20.519> used<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.180> guess<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.200> wait<00:03:22.320> to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
they used to I guess we have to wait to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.130 
they used to I guess we have to wait to
see<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.700> final<00:03:23.970> version<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.660> they<00:03:24.900> change

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
see in the final version if they change

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.460 
see in the final version if they change
anything<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.350> thanks<00:03:28.350> for
