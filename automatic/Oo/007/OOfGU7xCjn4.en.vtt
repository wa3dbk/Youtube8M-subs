or snips and I have my needle threaded

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.270 
or snips and I have my needle threaded
with<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:40.980> 20<00:00:41.340> inches<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.870> thread<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
with about 20 inches of thread and it's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.320 
with about 20 inches of thread and it's
doubled<00:00:44.700> back<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.110> see<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.150> goes

thing<00:03:14.100> with<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.880> other<00:03:15.000> circle

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.460 

I'm<00:03:27.530> gonna<00:03:27.710> set<00:03:27.950> my<00:03:27.980> needle<00:03:28.370> free<00:03:28.720> okay<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:29.810> the

I'm gonna set my needle free okay so the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.380 
I'm gonna set my needle free okay so the
cool<00:03:30.740> thing<00:03:30.770> about<00:03:31.010> Taylor<00:03:31.580> tax<00:03:31.850> is<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:33.230> um

cool thing about Taylor tax is that um
when<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:35.600> mark<00:03:36.050> your<00:03:36.290> fabric<00:03:36.500> for<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.100> pattern

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
when you mark your fabric for a pattern

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.840 
when you mark your fabric for a pattern
with<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:39.170> chalk<00:03:39.710> paper<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.310> tracing<00:03:40.700> wheel

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
with the chalk paper the tracing wheel

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.960 
with the chalk paper the tracing wheel
and<00:03:41.060> stuff<00:03:41.270> you<00:03:41.690> can<00:03:41.840> only<00:03:42.080> affect<00:03:42.500> one<00:03:42.970> fabric

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and stuff you can only affect one fabric

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.930 
and stuff you can only affect one fabric
of<00:03:44.300> time<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.410> with<00:03:45.590> these<00:03:45.860> Liam<00:03:46.730> doesn't

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
of time and so with these Liam doesn't

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.120 
of time and so with these Liam doesn't
be<00:03:47.150> magical<00:03:47.750> because<00:03:47.960> we<00:03:48.170> are<00:03:48.350> marking<00:03:48.980> it

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
be magical because we are marking it

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.470 
be magical because we are marking it
something<00:03:49.610> that<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:49.820> can't<00:03:50.030> reach<00:03:50.210> with<00:03:50.240> our

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
something that we can't reach with our

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.250 
something that we can't reach with our
marking<00:03:50.900> pen<00:03:51.850> but<00:03:52.850> we're<00:03:53.000> marking<00:03:53.450> two<00:03:53.900> pieces

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
marking pen but we're marking two pieces

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.570 
marking pen but we're marking two pieces
of<00:03:54.350> fabric<00:03:54.530> at<00:03:54.770> once<00:03:54.920> I'm<00:03:55.100> going<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.280> go<00:03:55.370> ahead

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
of fabric at once I'm going to go ahead

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
of fabric at once I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:55.790> let<00:03:56.570> this<00:03:56.810> slide<00:03:57.470> off

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
and let this slide off

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.120 
and let this slide off
okay<00:03:59.600> so<00:03:59.660> this<00:03:59.900> is<00:04:00.080> free<00:04:00.320> but<00:04:00.680> I've<00:04:00.770> got<00:04:00.920> my<00:04:01.070> two

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
okay so this is free but I've got my two

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.570 
okay so this is free but I've got my two
pieces<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.820> fabric<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.800> I'm<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.370> gonna

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
pieces of fabric and so I'm just gonna

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:13.840 
pieces of fabric and so I'm just gonna
separate<00:04:05.060> them<00:04:05.270> a<00:04:05.300> little<00:04:05.690> bit<00:04:08.110> see<00:04:12.820> okay

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
separate them a little bit see okay

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.170 
separate them a little bit see okay
separating<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.870> little<00:04:15.230> bit<00:04:16.180> setting

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
separating that a little bit setting

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.560 
separating that a little bit setting
them<00:04:17.299> free

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
them free

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.920 
them free
I<00:04:18.609> don't<00:04:19.609> want<00:04:19.730> that<00:04:19.940> thread<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.450> stay<00:04:20.750> in

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
I don't want that thread to stay in

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:30.520 
I don't want that thread to stay in
place<00:04:24.280> okay<00:04:26.440> now<00:04:27.440> both<00:04:28.430> fabrics<00:04:29.390> how<00:04:30.200> did<00:04:30.410> it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
place okay now both fabrics how did it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.400 
place okay now both fabrics how did it
just<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:30.770> dark<00:04:33.070> okay<00:04:34.450> now<00:04:35.450> both<00:04:35.660> fabrics<00:04:36.020> are

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
just get dark okay now both fabrics are

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.659 
just get dark okay now both fabrics are
worked<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.370> same<00:04:37.669> way<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:39.010> we<00:04:40.010> leave<00:04:40.250> lots<00:04:40.520> of

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
worked the same way and we leave lots of

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.670 
worked the same way and we leave lots of
extra<00:04:41.000> thread<00:04:41.270> lengths<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.410> doesn't

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
extra thread lengths so that it doesn't

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.640 
extra thread lengths so that it doesn't
get<00:04:42.800> lost<00:04:43.010> or<00:04:43.610> fall<00:04:43.940> out<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.510> you<00:04:45.500> could

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
get lost or fall out and you could

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.860 
get lost or fall out and you could
definitely<00:04:45.830> tug<00:04:46.730> on<00:04:46.760> these<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.450> pull<00:04:47.660> them<00:04:47.780> up

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
definitely tug on these to pull them up

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.020 
definitely tug on these to pull them up
a<00:04:48.020> little<00:04:48.169> higher<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.550> seems<00:04:49.820> like<00:04:50.000> a

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
a little higher and it seems like a

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.330 
a little higher and it seems like a
silly<00:04:50.419> step<00:04:50.840> that's<00:04:51.050> kind<00:04:51.410> of<00:04:51.560> easy<00:04:52.100> to

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
silly step that's kind of easy to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.840 
silly step that's kind of easy to
overlook<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:54.070> have<00:04:55.070> been<00:04:55.250> known<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.430> skip

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
overlook and I have been known to skip

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.430 
overlook and I have been known to skip
it<00:04:55.940> myself<00:04:56.120> but<00:04:56.660> then<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.110> go<00:04:57.230> back<00:04:57.410> to

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
it myself but then you go back to

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.760 
it myself but then you go back to
actually<00:04:57.919> constructing<00:04:58.370> your<00:04:58.400> pattern<00:04:58.820> and

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
actually constructing your pattern and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.340 
actually constructing your pattern and
you<00:05:00.770> really<00:05:01.100> think<00:05:01.460> two<00:05:02.120> hours<00:05:02.390> ago<00:05:02.510> Rachel

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
you really think two hours ago Rachel

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.460 
you really think two hours ago Rachel
for<00:05:04.600> have<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:05.690> gone<00:05:05.840> ahead<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.110> made<00:05:06.320> two

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
for have you gone ahead and made two

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.290 
for have you gone ahead and made two
attacks<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.400> that<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.669> can<00:05:07.850> line<00:05:08.060> up<00:05:08.210> your

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
attacks so that you can line up your

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.650 
attacks so that you can line up your
fabric<00:05:08.450> so<00:05:08.810> basically<00:05:09.910> I'm<00:05:10.910> rambling<00:05:11.360> sorry

um<00:05:50.390> I'm<00:05:51.390> gonna<00:05:51.780> go<00:05:51.960> ahead<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.200> be<00:05:52.530> calmed<00:05:52.950> and

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
um I'm gonna go ahead and be calmed and

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.420 
um I'm gonna go ahead and be calmed and
you<00:05:53.700> move<00:05:53.850> us<00:05:54.000> through<00:05:54.240> two<00:05:54.510> notches<00:05:54.750> and

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
you move us through two notches and

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.270 
you move us through two notches and
we're<00:05:56.430> gonna<00:05:56.520> pin<00:05:56.910> um<00:05:57.590> really<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.950> just<00:05:59.130> need

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
we're gonna pin um really you just need

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.860 
we're gonna pin um really you just need
one<00:05:59.310> piece<00:05:59.850> of<00:06:00.000> fabric<00:06:00.120> for<00:06:00.420> that<00:06:00.480> let's<00:06:00.720> not

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
one piece of fabric for that let's not

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.060 
one piece of fabric for that let's not
waste<00:06:01.020> fabric<00:06:01.500> um<00:06:01.800> pin<00:06:02.790> one<00:06:03.090> square<00:06:03.510> -<00:06:04.410> you're

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
waste fabric um pin one square - you're

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.640 
waste fabric um pin one square - you're
not<00:06:05.760> just<00:06:06.060> thing<00:06:06.270> now<00:06:06.570> this<00:06:06.870> is<00:06:07.110> gonna<00:06:07.260> feel

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
not just thing now this is gonna feel

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.090 
not just thing now this is gonna feel
like<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.340> silly<00:06:08.610> busywork<00:06:09.180> thing<00:06:10.140> but<00:06:10.620> it's

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
like a silly busywork thing but it's

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.930 
like a silly busywork thing but it's
just<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:11.670> demonstrate<00:06:12.800> marking<00:06:13.800> on<00:06:14.010> fabric

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
just to demonstrate marking on fabric

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.240 
just to demonstrate marking on fabric
for<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:15.960> pattern<00:06:16.260> so<00:06:18.440> you<00:06:19.440> will<00:06:19.740> in<00:06:20.070> future

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
for a pattern so you will in future

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.090 
for a pattern so you will in future
pattern<00:06:20.850> usage<00:06:21.320> see<00:06:22.320> either<00:06:22.530> single

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
pattern usage see either single

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.910 
pattern usage see either single
triangles<00:06:23.550> or<00:06:23.700> double<00:06:24.000> triangles<00:06:24.680> to<00:06:25.680> mark

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
triangles or double triangles to mark

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.950 
triangles or double triangles to mark
your<00:06:26.100> fabric<00:06:26.250> this<00:06:26.820> is<00:06:26.940> another<00:06:27.240> one<00:06:27.480> where<00:06:27.690> in

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
your fabric this is another one where in

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.780 
your fabric this is another one where in
the<00:06:28.380> future<00:06:28.650> let's<00:06:28.860> say<00:06:28.980> this<00:06:29.190> is<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.550> left

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
the future let's say this is the left

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.550 
the future let's say this is the left
pant<00:06:30.090> leg<00:06:30.330> or<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.720> front<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.140> left<00:06:31.290> pant

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
pant leg or the front of the left pant

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.040 
pant leg or the front of the left pant
like<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:32.010> you<00:06:32.970> also<00:06:33.120> need<00:06:33.420> to<00:06:33.450> line<00:06:33.660> up<00:06:33.690> in<00:06:33.960> the

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
like and you also need to line up in the

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.450 
like and you also need to line up in the
future<00:06:34.320> to<00:06:34.500> the<00:06:34.620> right<00:06:34.860> side<00:06:35.070> of<00:06:35.190> the<00:06:35.280> Left

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
future to the right side of the Left

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.300 
future to the right side of the Left
pattern<00:06:36.170> to<00:06:37.170> the<00:06:37.260> backside<00:06:37.740> of<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.950> left<00:06:38.100> pant

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
pattern to the backside of the left pant

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.330 
pattern to the backside of the left pant
leg<00:06:38.810> these<00:06:39.810> are<00:06:40.050> another<00:06:40.320> way<00:06:40.530> to<00:06:40.590> indicate<00:06:40.980> on

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
leg these are another way to indicate on

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.920 
leg these are another way to indicate on
the<00:06:41.490> edge<00:06:41.670> of<00:06:41.880> fabric<00:06:42.060> so<00:06:42.600> you<00:06:42.660> don't<00:06:42.780> have<00:06:42.840> to

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
the edge of fabric so you don't have to

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.090 
the edge of fabric so you don't have to
mess<00:06:43.110> with<00:06:43.140> your<00:06:43.350> needle<00:06:43.650> and<00:06:43.680> thread<00:06:43.770> if<00:06:44.010> it's

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
mess with your needle and thread if it's

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.090 
mess with your needle and thread if it's
on<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.280> edge<00:06:44.460> of<00:06:44.640> fabric<00:06:44.850> you<00:06:45.630> can<00:06:46.050> mark<00:06:46.860> it<00:06:46.950> by

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
on the edge of fabric you can mark it by

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.130 
on the edge of fabric you can mark it by
snipping<00:06:47.430> it<00:06:47.700> as<00:06:48.090> long<00:06:48.480> as<00:06:48.510> you<00:06:48.690> don't<00:06:48.810> snip

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
snipping it as long as you don't snip

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.600 
snipping it as long as you don't snip
all<00:06:49.350> the<00:06:49.440> way<00:06:49.560> into<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:49.890> seam<00:06:50.100> allowance<00:06:50.490> and

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
all the way into the seam allowance and

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.880 
all the way into the seam allowance and
they'll<00:06:51.060> not<00:06:51.540> make<00:06:51.990> your<00:06:52.110> triangles<00:06:52.530> go<00:06:52.650> into

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
they'll not make your triangles go into

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.730 
they'll not make your triangles go into
the<00:06:52.980> seam<00:06:53.160> allowance<00:06:53.520> so<00:06:54.120> use<00:06:54.570> snips<00:06:55.140> or

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.340 

something<00:06:58.740> scissors<00:06:59.700> or<00:06:59.850> snips<00:07:00.210> listen<00:07:01.169> about

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
something scissors or snips listen about

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.670 
something scissors or snips listen about
that<00:07:01.560> triangle<00:07:02.300> all<00:07:03.300> the<00:07:03.450> way<00:07:04.940> okay<00:07:05.970> um<00:07:06.680> and

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
that triangle all the way okay um and

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.360 
that triangle all the way okay um and
that<00:07:07.770> is<00:07:07.980> how<00:07:08.640> you<00:07:08.700> mark<00:07:09.330> that<00:07:09.600> fabric<00:07:10.110> and

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
that is how you mark that fabric and

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.890 
that is how you mark that fabric and
then<00:07:11.370> in<00:07:11.700> the<00:07:11.880> future<00:07:12.030> down<00:07:12.330> the<00:07:12.390> line<00:07:12.630> in<00:07:12.840> a

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
then in the future down the line in a

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.840 
then in the future down the line in a
future<00:07:13.169> step<00:07:13.380> it's<00:07:13.710> gonna<00:07:13.980> say<00:07:14.250> line<00:07:14.640> up

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
future step it's gonna say line up

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.120 
future step it's gonna say line up
notches<00:07:15.270> and<00:07:15.510> they'll<00:07:15.750> line<00:07:15.990> up<00:07:16.020> and<00:07:16.530> you'll

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
notches and they'll line up and you'll

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.750 
notches and they'll line up and you'll
feel<00:07:17.280> glad<00:07:17.580> now<00:07:18.030> another<00:07:18.360> way<00:07:18.540> to<00:07:18.570> do<00:07:18.900> that<00:07:19.110> um

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
feel glad now another way to do that um

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.400 
feel glad now another way to do that um
well<00:07:20.810> sometimes<00:07:21.810> they<00:07:21.960> do<00:07:22.050> too<00:07:22.200> not<00:07:22.350> just

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
well sometimes they do too not just

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.960 
well sometimes they do too not just
because<00:07:22.800> I<00:07:23.010> think<00:07:23.220> just<00:07:23.520> because<00:07:23.669> they<00:07:23.790> want

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
because I think just because they want

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.540 
because I think just because they want
to<00:07:24.060> be<00:07:24.150> thorough<00:07:24.390> you<00:07:24.720> can<00:07:25.320> do<00:07:25.500> you<00:07:26.190> can<00:07:26.340> cut

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
to be thorough you can do you can cut

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.900 
to be thorough you can do you can cut
those<00:07:26.700> two<00:07:26.880> notches<00:07:27.620> sometimes<00:07:28.620> I<00:07:29.220> cheat<00:07:29.490> I

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
those two notches sometimes I cheat I

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.650 
those two notches sometimes I cheat I
use<00:07:30.270> my<00:07:30.960> water-soluble<00:07:31.740> side<00:07:32.130> of<00:07:32.400> my<00:07:32.580> pen<00:07:33.390> and

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:33.660 
use my water-soluble side of my pen and

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.350 
use my water-soluble side of my pen and
just<00:07:34.620> kind<00:07:34.919> of<00:07:35.040> do<00:07:35.250> like<00:07:35.460> a<00:07:35.490> little<00:07:35.730> peak<00:07:36.090> and

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
just kind of do like a little peak and

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.550 
just kind of do like a little peak and
Mark<00:07:36.780> right<00:07:37.770> at<00:07:38.010> those<00:07:38.190> two<00:07:38.430> spots<00:07:39.169> and<00:07:40.169> you

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 
Mark right at those two spots and you

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.740 
Mark right at those two spots and you
may<00:07:40.830> or<00:07:40.950> may<00:07:41.040> not<00:07:41.070> a<00:07:41.220> little<00:07:42.210> works<00:07:42.390> but

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750 
may or may not a little works but

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.860 
may or may not a little works but
they're<00:07:43.169> there<00:07:43.380> um<00:07:44.090> so<00:07:45.090> that's<00:07:45.270> another<00:07:45.690> way

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
they're there um so that's another way

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.230 
they're there um so that's another way
to<00:07:45.900> mark<00:07:46.260> it<00:07:46.500> I<00:07:46.770> always<00:07:47.730> do<00:07:47.910> the<00:07:48.060> scissors

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
to mark it I always do the scissors

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.950 
to mark it I always do the scissors
almost<00:07:49.140> always<00:07:49.700> but<00:07:50.700> you<00:07:51.210> can<00:07:51.390> also<00:07:51.510> mark<00:07:51.840> it

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
almost always but you can also mark it

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.420
