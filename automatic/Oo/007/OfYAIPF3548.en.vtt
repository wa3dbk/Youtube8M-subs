more marble cosplayers the panels I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
think are also being run fairly well I
think<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.950> some<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.520> sum<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
think they think some the sum that I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.310 
think they think some the sum that I
attended<00:01:57.240> were<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.719> slow<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> get

attended were a little slow to get

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
attended were a little slow to get
started<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.790> are

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
started I think that's because they are
