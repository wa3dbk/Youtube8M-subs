00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:22.010 
that scale tonight the second fret third
string<00:00:18.590> first<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.550> did<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> C

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
string first and we did this in the C

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.999 
string first and we did this in the C
scale

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.890 

so<00:00:32.009> let's<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.180> four<00:00:33.450> clicks<00:00:33.720> of<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
so let's have four clicks of the

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.840 
so let's have four clicks of the
metronome<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.559> dirt<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.640> beat<00:00:35.820> per

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
metronome on this dirt and one beat per

00:00:35.850 --> 00:02:49.610 
metronome on this dirt and one beat per
click<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.050> night<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> down<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.700> two

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.780 

see<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> switched<00:02:50.950> my<00:02:51.099> fingerings

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
see I switched my fingerings

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.850 
see I switched my fingerings
because<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:52.390> trying<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.810> hold<00:02:52.989> my<00:02:53.230> guitar<00:02:53.680> up

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
because I'm trying to hold my guitar up

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.759 
because I'm trying to hold my guitar up
and<00:02:54.129> it's<00:02:54.340> not<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.730> easy<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.930> showed<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.650> have

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
and it's not that easy I showed you have

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.259 
and it's not that easy I showed you have
a<00:02:56.799> double<00:02:57.159> little<00:02:57.580> screen<00:02:57.879> on<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> beach

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
a double little screen on the beach

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.270 
a double little screen on the beach
easier<00:02:58.629> for<00:02:58.780> me<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.870> only<00:02:59.110> return<00:02:59.470> nonetheless

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
easier for me to only return nonetheless

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.130 
easier for me to only return nonetheless
you<00:03:00.700> see<00:03:00.909> that's<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.209> good<00:03:01.360> exercise<00:03:01.629> for<00:03:01.870> your

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
you see that's a good exercise for your

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.089 
you see that's a good exercise for your
right<00:03:02.290> hand<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.150> build<00:03:04.150> up<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.510> as<00:03:05.099> well

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
right hand and build up to that as well

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.000 
right hand and build up to that as well
as<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.370> can<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:08.230> can<00:03:08.260> make<00:03:08.890> your

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
as you can and you can make your

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.039 
as you can and you can make your
metronome<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.489> little<00:03:09.670> bit<00:03:09.790> slower<00:03:09.970> I'm<00:03:10.209> at<00:03:10.330> 144

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
metronome a little bit slower I'm at 144

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.110 
metronome a little bit slower I'm at 144
you<00:03:11.440> can<00:03:11.590> slow<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:11.769> down<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.190> 102<00:03:12.790> do<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you can slow it down to 102 do the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.750 
you can slow it down to 102 do the
double<00:03:13.450> speed<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:14.409> would<00:03:14.560> help<00:03:14.739> later<00:03:15.640> on

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
double speed it would help later on

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:27.000 
double speed it would help later on
we'll<00:03:16.239> talk<00:03:16.420> about<00:03:24.720> very<00:03:25.720> fast<00:03:26.290> scales<00:03:26.680> and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
we'll talk about very fast scales and

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.920 
we'll talk about very fast scales and
good<00:03:27.700> technique<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.269> left<00:03:28.569> hand<00:03:28.780> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
good technique for that left hand and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.630 
good technique for that left hand and
right<00:03:29.079> hand<00:03:29.140> for<00:03:29.920> now<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.220> should<00:03:30.280> suffice

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
right hand for now this should suffice

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.370 
right hand for now this should suffice
so<00:03:31.150> that's<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:32.109> practice<00:03:32.680> companion<00:03:33.160> see
