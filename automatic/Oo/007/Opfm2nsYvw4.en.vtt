a<00:00:09.960> phone<00:00:10.139> launch<00:00:10.349> at<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> little<00:00:10.769> friendly

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
a phone launch at a little friendly

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.919 
a phone launch at a little friendly
competition<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> present<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.120> the

competition so I present to you the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.099 
competition so I present to you the
oneplus<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.000> Samsung's<00:00:15.000> latest<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.570> galaxy

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
oneplus and Samsung's latest the galaxy

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260 
oneplus and Samsung's latest the galaxy
s6<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.220> they<00:00:17.310> look<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.520> side<00:00:17.910> by<00:00:17.940> side

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
s6 see what they look like side by side

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.090 
s6 see what they look like side by side
maybe<00:00:18.630> decide<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.439> might<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.830> right

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
