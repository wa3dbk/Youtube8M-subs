because<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.560> point<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.130> mean<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> last<00:01:35.640> 23

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
because at this point I mean the last 23

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.700 
because at this point I mean the last 23
call<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> duty's<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.350> kind<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.560> been

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
call of duty's had kind of been

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.999 
call of duty's had kind of been
lackluster<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.850> should<00:01:39.509> say<00:01:39.659> too<00:01:39.979> because<00:01:40.979> i

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
lackluster I should say too because i

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.310 
lackluster I should say too because i
really<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.850> black<00:01:42.150> ops<00:01:42.360> 1<00:01:42.479> i<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.140> me

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
really like black ops 1 i think for me

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
really like black ops 1 i think for me
that<00:01:43.649> was<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> height<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> series<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that was the height of the series and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
that was the height of the series and
even<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:46.049> black<00:01:46.350> ops<00:01:46.500> 1<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.220> didn't

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
even when black ops 1 was out I didn't

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.060 
even when black ops 1 was out I didn't
realize<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.210> after<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.140> towards<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
realize it so after you know towards the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
realize it so after you know towards the
end<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> black<00:01:50.640> ops<00:01:50.880> when<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.450> really

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
end the black ops when I just really

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
end the black ops when I just really
didn't<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> game<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.939> really

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
didn't like the game I was really

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
didn't like the game I was really
getting<00:01:54.329> frustrated<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:55.229> in-ad<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.430> me<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
getting frustrated with in-ad I for me I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.039 
getting frustrated with in-ad I for me I
think<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.420> call<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> duty

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
think it's just the call of duty

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.780 
think it's just the call of duty
syndrome<00:01:58.469> at<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.770> point<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.219> don't<00:01:59.280> think

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
syndrome at this point I don't think

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
syndrome at this point I don't think
there<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.090> ever<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.960> call<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> duty<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
there will ever be a call a duty that I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
there will ever be a call a duty that I
would<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.909> beginning<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.750> end<00:02:03.890> because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
would like from beginning to end because

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.080 
would like from beginning to end because
people

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
from now people would be exploiting

but<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.049> know<00:02:25.080> that's<00:02:25.500> why<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:25.890> only

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
but you know that's why I don't only

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.520 
but you know that's why I don't only
play<00:02:26.519> call<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.879> duty<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.390> would<00:02:27.629> never<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.349> able

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
this amazing game after the fact but

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.569 
this amazing game after the fact but
Frank<00:02:49.440> time<00:02:49.650> street<00:02:49.920> was<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.099> really<00:02:50.430> big

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
Frank time street was a really big

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.509 
Frank time street was a really big
problem<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:51.209> call<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.599> duty<00:02:51.840> 4<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.950> was<00:02:53.370> out

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
problem when call of duty 4 was was out

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.400 
problem when call of duty 4 was was out
there<00:02:53.940> was<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> big<00:02:54.450> thing<00:02:54.480> at<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.900> moment<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.379> I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
there was a big thing at the moment so I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.140 
there was a big thing at the moment so I
mean<00:02:55.590> there<00:02:56.220> there<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.670> never<00:02:56.819> been<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
mean there there have never been a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.400 
mean there there have never been a
perfect<00:02:57.480> call<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.870> duty<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.110> there<00:02:58.290> never

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
perfect call of duty and there never

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.949 
perfect call of duty and there never
will<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.910> I'm<00:03:00.000> wondering<00:03:00.150> why<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.840> much

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
will be so I'm wondering why so much

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.420 
will be so I'm wondering why so much
people<00:03:01.290> hate<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.739> game<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.190> know<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.340> think

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
people hate the game you know I think

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.339 
people hate the game you know I think
people's<00:03:02.940> expectations<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.780> call<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:03.989> duty

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
people's expectations of call of duty

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.369 
people's expectations of call of duty
are<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:04.910> ridiculously<00:03:05.910> high<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.569> also<00:03:07.079> think

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
are just ridiculously high I also think

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.520 
are just ridiculously high I also think
people<00:03:07.799> wanted<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.819> be<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> best<00:03:09.500> Call<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
people wanted it to be the best Call of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.370 
people wanted it to be the best Call of
Duty<00:03:10.859> ever<00:03:11.010> made<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.940> last<00:03:12.930> two<00:03:13.230> have

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
Duty ever made because the last two have

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.220 
Duty ever made because the last two have
been<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:13.859> bad<00:03:14.130> mw3<00:03:14.910> was<00:03:15.569> probably<00:03:16.019> the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
been really bad mw3 was probably the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.349 
been really bad mw3 was probably the
worst<00:03:16.260> until<00:03:17.250> black<00:03:17.489> ops<00:03:17.670> 2<00:03:17.880> came<00:03:18.060> out<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
worst until black ops 2 came out and

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.500 
worst until black ops 2 came out and
then<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.690> was<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.139> worst<00:03:19.579> but<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.850> think

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
then that was the worst but I think

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.289 
then that was the worst but I think
people<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:22.019> way<00:03:22.889> too<00:03:22.950> high<00:03:23.310> expectations<00:03:24.150> of

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
people have way too high expectations of

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.900 
people have way too high expectations of
this<00:03:24.389> game<00:03:24.599> when<00:03:24.840> coming<00:03:25.139> into<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.440> game<00:03:25.620> I

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
this game when coming into this game I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.819 
this game when coming into this game I
wasn't<00:03:26.910> hyped<00:03:27.420> for<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.810> at<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.109> until<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
wasn't hyped for it at all until you

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.500 
wasn't hyped for it at all until you
know<00:03:29.130> towards<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.700> end<00:03:29.849> because<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.299> just

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
know towards the end because I just

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.170 
know towards the end because I just
really<00:03:30.840> wanted<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.560> new<00:03:32.340> game<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.819> play<00:03:32.940> because

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
really wanted a new game to play because

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.670 
really wanted a new game to play because
I<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.510> couldn't<00:03:33.750> stand<00:03:34.019> black<00:03:34.260> ops<00:03:34.500> 2

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
I just couldn't stand black ops 2

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.199 
I just couldn't stand black ops 2
anymore<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.069> have<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.459> stop<00:03:35.760> playing<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
anymore I just have to stop playing it

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.140 
anymore I just have to stop playing it
completely<00:03:37.099> but<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:38.340> didn't<00:03:38.760> come<00:03:38.880> into<00:03:39.060> this

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
completely but I didn't come into this

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.699 
completely but I didn't come into this
game<00:03:39.269> with<00:03:39.510> high<00:03:39.660> expectations<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.410> didn't

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
game with high expectations I didn't

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.259 
game with high expectations I didn't
expect<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.160> be<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.430> best<00:03:41.639> game<00:03:41.910> ever<00:03:42.090> made

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
expect it to be the best game ever made

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.009 
expect it to be the best game ever made
I<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.549> was<00:03:44.910> hoping<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.329> something<00:03:45.780> that

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
I just I was hoping for something that

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.080 
I just I was hoping for something that
would<00:03:46.109> be<00:03:46.260> fun<00:03:46.530> something<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.519> was<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.880> black

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
would be fun something that was in black

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.870 
would be fun something that was in black
ops<00:03:48.329> 2<00:03:48.480> which<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.859> me<00:03:49.980> black<00:03:50.370> ops<00:03:50.549> 2<00:03:50.760> was

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
ops 2 which was to me black ops 2 was

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.270 
ops 2 which was to me black ops 2 was
extremely<00:03:51.419> boring<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:51.989> do<00:03:52.380> appreciate<00:03:52.799> that

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
extremely boring I I do appreciate that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.949 
extremely boring I I do appreciate that
they<00:03:53.370> tried<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.639> innovate<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.389> scoring

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
they tried to innovate with the scoring

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.159 
they tried to innovate with the scoring
system<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:56.579> know<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> mean<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.720> was<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> good

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
system you know I mean it was a good

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.990 
system you know I mean it was a good
thought<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.620> paper<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.519> for<00:03:59.730> me<00:03:59.849> it<00:03:59.970> just

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
thought on paper but for me it just

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.240 
thought on paper but for me it just
didn't<00:04:00.329> work<00:04:00.450> out<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:01.139> know<00:04:01.169> I<00:04:01.290> didn't<00:04:02.040> like

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
didn't work out you know I didn't like

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.240 
didn't work out you know I didn't like
TDM<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.209> free<00:04:03.450> for<00:04:03.690> all<00:04:03.780> because<00:04:04.169> you<00:04:04.470> know

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
TDM and free for all because you know

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.800 
TDM and free for all because you know
getting<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.669> high<00:04:05.940> killstreaks<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.660> those

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
getting the high killstreaks in those

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.349 
getting the high killstreaks in those
game<00:04:07.049> modes<00:04:07.319> were<00:04:07.500> impossible<00:04:08.250> because<00:04:09.239> the

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
game modes were impossible because the

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.280 
game modes were impossible because the
game<00:04:09.540> would<00:04:09.690> end<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:12.239> know<00:04:12.419> if<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:13.169> wasn't

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
game would end so you know if it wasn't

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.670 
game would end so you know if it wasn't
my<00:04:13.560> cup<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.769> tea

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
my cup of tea

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.400 
my cup of tea
but<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.670> just<00:04:16.180> wanted<00:04:16.600> this<00:04:16.750> game<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.259> be

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
but I just wanted this game to be

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.439 
but I just wanted this game to be
entertaining<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:18.070> play<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.639> wanted<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.209> guns

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
entertaining to play I wanted the guns

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.479 
entertaining to play I wanted the guns
to<00:04:19.600> go<00:04:19.810> faster<00:04:20.289> because<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.100> didn't<00:04:21.400> like

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
to go faster because I just didn't like

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.050 
to go faster because I just didn't like
that<00:04:21.729> I<00:04:21.910> think<00:04:22.240> when<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.990> make<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.380> guns

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
that I think when you make the guns

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.540 
that I think when you make the guns
require<00:04:25.060> more<00:04:25.479> bullets<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.139> kill<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:27.009> make<00:04:27.310> it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
require more bullets to kill you make it

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.700 
require more bullets to kill you make it
more<00:04:27.820> connection<00:04:28.570> basis<00:04:28.990> than<00:04:29.139> anything<00:04:29.530> else

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
more connection basis than anything else

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.670 
more connection basis than anything else
I<00:04:29.949> don't<00:04:30.400> think<00:04:30.639> it<00:04:30.759> takes<00:04:30.970> more<00:04:31.150> skill<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.900> just

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
I don't think it takes more skill I just

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.110 
I don't think it takes more skill I just
think<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.949> just<00:04:33.070> makes<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.460> more<00:04:33.520> connection

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
think it just makes it more connection

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.040 
think it just makes it more connection
because<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:34.389> you<00:04:34.479> have<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> better<00:04:34.780> connection

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
because if you have a better connection

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.740 
because if you have a better connection
you're<00:04:35.410> going<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.620> win<00:04:35.830> because<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:37.570> just

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
you're going to win because it just

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.450 
you're going to win because it just
takes<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.229> much<00:04:38.560> more<00:04:38.830> by<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.039> scale<00:04:39.340> if

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
takes that much more by the scale if

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.219 
takes that much more by the scale if
you're<00:04:39.580> killing<00:04:39.940> people<00:04:40.240> really<00:04:40.539> quickly<00:04:40.960> if

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
you're killing people really quickly if

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.230 
you're killing people really quickly if
you<00:04:41.740> are<00:04:42.070> better<00:04:42.460> than<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.759> player

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
you are better than that player

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.210 
you are better than that player
regardless<00:04:43.570> of<00:04:44.050> connection<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.770> will<00:04:44.979> beat

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
regardless of connection you will beat

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.249 
regardless of connection you will beat
them<00:04:45.460> now<00:04:45.669> obviously<00:04:46.330> not<00:04:46.509> every<00:04:46.810> time<00:04:47.020> it's

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
them now obviously not every time it's

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.740 
them now obviously not every time it's
like<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.650> there<00:04:47.889> are<00:04:47.979> moments<00:04:48.160> where<00:04:48.520> I'd<00:04:48.639> I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
like that there are moments where I'd I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.210 
like that there are moments where I'd I
see<00:04:49.750> one<00:04:50.020> bullet<00:04:50.289> come<00:04:50.560> up<00:04:50.680> from<00:04:50.860> somebody's

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
see one bullet come up from somebody's

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.710 
see one bullet come up from somebody's
gun<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.580> into<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> die<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.449> like<00:04:52.599> you

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
gun and into the die and it's like you

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.909 
gun and into the die and it's like you
know<00:04:52.810> what<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.050> fuck<00:04:53.289> but<00:04:53.470> then<00:04:53.590> when<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.710> look

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
know what the fuck but then when I look

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.620 
know what the fuck but then when I look

also<00:06:38.419> heard<00:06:38.780> that<00:06:39.110> this<00:06:40.009> game<00:06:40.340> wasn't<00:06:40.669> made

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
also heard that this game wasn't made

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.870 
also heard that this game wasn't made
for<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.810> current<00:06:42.110> gen<00:06:42.590> it<00:06:42.979> was<00:06:43.160> made<00:06:43.430> for<00:06:43.729> the

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
for the current gen it was made for the

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.809 
for the current gen it was made for the
next<00:06:44.300> gen<00:06:44.539> and<00:06:44.750> ported<00:06:45.289> to<00:06:45.319> the<00:06:45.919> current<00:06:46.610> gen

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
next gen and ported to the current gen

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.430 
next gen and ported to the current gen
which<00:06:47.030> kind<00:06:47.300> of<00:06:47.389> one<00:06:47.539> makes<00:06:47.930> sense<00:06:48.229> because

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
which kind of one makes sense because

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.899 
which kind of one makes sense because
you<00:06:48.860> know<00:06:48.949> the<00:06:49.099> graphics<00:06:49.550> are<00:06:49.669> kind<00:06:49.849> of

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
you know the graphics are kind of

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.230 
you know the graphics are kind of
lackluster<00:06:50.569> and<00:06:51.139> whatnot<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:52.490> game's<00:06:52.940> kind

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
lackluster and whatnot the game's kind

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.999 
lackluster and whatnot the game's kind
of<00:06:53.330> dough<00:06:53.569> so<00:06:53.810> I<00:06:53.870> do<00:06:53.960> think<00:06:54.380> that<00:06:54.440> this<00:06:54.710> game

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
of dough so I do think that this game

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.100 
of dough so I do think that this game
wasn't<00:06:55.400> made<00:06:55.759> for<00:06:55.789> this<00:06:56.300> jen<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:56.930> if<00:06:57.020> you

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
wasn't made for this jen and if you

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.080 
wasn't made for this jen and if you
think<00:06:57.380> about<00:06:57.470> it<00:06:57.680> that<00:06:57.800> way<00:06:58.250> that's<00:06:58.550> why<00:06:58.789> there

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
think about it that way that's why there

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.409 
think about it that way that's why there
are<00:06:59.120> those<00:06:59.419> problems<00:07:01.090> you<00:07:02.090> know<00:07:02.210> those

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
are those problems you know those

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.320 
are those problems you know those
problems<00:07:02.870> exist<00:07:03.490> because<00:07:04.490> the<00:07:04.849> game<00:07:05.090> was<00:07:05.120> just

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
problems exist because the game was just

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.170 
problems exist because the game was just
not<00:07:05.720> meant<00:07:05.750> to<00:07:06.349> be<00:07:06.470> played<00:07:06.830> on<00:07:07.159> these<00:07:07.520> systems

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
not meant to be played on these systems

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.200 
not meant to be played on these systems
so<00:07:08.770> I'm<00:07:09.770> kind<00:07:10.099> of<00:07:10.159> curious<00:07:10.370> leave<00:07:10.789> it<00:07:10.940> in<00:07:11.060> the

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
so I'm kind of curious leave it in the

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.149 
so I'm kind of curious leave it in the

bad but for the most part I enjoy the
game<00:07:35.030> you<00:07:35.360> know<00:07:35.479> i<00:07:35.509> mean<00:07:35.630> the<00:07:35.840> killstreaks<00:07:36.380> are

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590

though<00:07:39.620> they<00:07:39.770> did<00:07:39.979> kind<00:07:40.280> of<00:07:40.370> nerf<00:07:40.610> it<00:07:40.909> but<00:07:41.180> I

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 
though they did kind of nerf it but I

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.540 
though they did kind of nerf it but I
kind<00:07:41.539> of<00:07:41.599> think<00:07:41.840> that<00:07:42.050> it<00:07:42.229> needed<00:07:42.469> it<00:07:42.740> because

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550 
kind of think that it needed it because

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.540 
kind of think that it needed it because
I<00:07:44.210> do<00:07:44.330> think<00:07:44.810> that<00:07:44.870> if<00:07:45.050> you<00:07:45.080> had<00:07:45.349> every<00:07:46.039> Park<00:07:46.370> in

I do think that if you had every Park in

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.300 
I do think that if you had every Park in
this<00:07:46.699> game<00:07:47.030> you'd<00:07:47.449> be<00:07:47.630> like<00:07:47.870> the<00:07:48.110> most<00:07:48.440> Opie
