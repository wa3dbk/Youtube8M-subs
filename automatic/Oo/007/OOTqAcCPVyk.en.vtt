come up with our pipeline that we then

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.630 
come up with our pipeline that we then
follow<00:01:00.260> through<00:01:00.500> with<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.800> levels<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:01.460> don't

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
follow through with the levels we don't

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.410 
follow through with the levels we don't
really<00:01:01.969> start<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:02.359> anything<00:01:02.809> until<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:03.500> have<00:01:03.739> a

you know concept usually starts with

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.980 
you know concept usually starts with
working<00:01:13.759> off<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.939> art<00:01:14.090> director<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:14.689> setting

of the set dressing out there we

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.120 
of the set dressing out there we
definitely<00:01:19.790> had<00:01:19.880> some<00:01:19.909> challenges<00:01:20.570> where<00:01:20.930> you

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
definitely had some challenges where you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.830 
definitely had some challenges where you
know<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.400> would<00:01:22.670> call<00:01:22.909> maybe<00:01:23.090> overzealousness

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
know I would call maybe overzealousness

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.289

of<00:01:24.290> artists<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.920> try<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.189> make<00:01:25.430> something<00:01:25.700> look

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
of artists to try to make something look

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.020 
of artists to try to make something look
really<00:01:26.659> cool<00:01:26.869> but<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:28.130> doing<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.670> they've

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
really cool but in doing that they've

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.179 
really cool but in doing that they've
changed<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.659> corner<00:01:30.110> or<00:01:30.439> changed<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.920> sight

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
changed a corner or changed the sight

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.340 
changed a corner or changed the sight
line<00:01:31.400> which<00:01:31.790> then<00:01:32.030> has<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.270> knock-on<00:01:32.540> effect<00:01:33.079> to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
line which then has a knock-on effect to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.260 
line which then has a knock-on effect to
where<00:01:34.009> you<00:01:34.189> can<00:01:34.369> stand<00:01:34.640> when<00:01:34.939> you're<00:01:35.090> playing

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
where you can stand when you're playing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.760 
where you can stand when you're playing
multiplayer<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.960> can<00:01:36.110> get<00:01:36.259> shot<00:01:36.470> where

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
multiplayer and you can get shot where

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.039 
multiplayer and you can get shot where
before<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.220> weren't<00:01:37.670> getting<00:01:37.759> shot<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.479> we

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
before you weren't getting shot so we

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.350 
before you weren't getting shot so we
definitely<00:01:39.229> in<00:01:39.829> our<00:01:40.250> first<00:01:40.520> few<00:01:40.700> levels<00:01:41.030> had

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
definitely in our first few levels had

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.630 
definitely in our first few levels had
to<00:01:41.570> keep<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.079> strict<00:01:42.320> eye<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.040> every<00:01:43.460> asset

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
to keep a strict eye on that every asset

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.520

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.490
