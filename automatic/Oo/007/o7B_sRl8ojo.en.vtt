00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
of shoes when they have this as an

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.880 
of shoes when they have this as an
option<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.479> yeah<00:05:46.169> there<00:05:46.410> are<00:05:46.560> slight

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
option and yeah there are slight

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.320 
option and yeah there are slight
differences<00:05:47.160> when<00:05:47.640> you<00:05:47.760> look<00:05:47.910> at<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.120> two

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
differences when you look at the two

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.940 
differences when you look at the two
shoes<00:05:48.570> up<00:05:48.810> close<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.320> come<00:05:49.470> on<00:05:49.620> close<00:05:49.919> and

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
shoes up close and come on close and

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.740 
shoes up close and come on close and
have<00:05:50.280> a<00:05:50.310> look<00:05:50.580> at<00:05:50.729> them<00:05:50.880> we'll<00:05:51.450> sort<00:05:51.660> of

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
have a look at them we'll sort of

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.020 
have a look at them we'll sort of
dissect<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.410> differences<00:05:52.950> between<00:05:53.160> them<00:05:53.580> but

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
dissect the differences between them but

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.610 
dissect the differences between them but
I<00:05:54.060> don't<00:05:54.300> think<00:05:54.570> that<00:05:54.750> it's<00:05:54.990> worth<00:05:55.290> paying

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
I don't think that it's worth paying

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.290 
I don't think that it's worth paying
twice<00:05:55.950> as<00:05:56.190> much<00:05:56.370> for<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.640> shoe<00:05:56.850> that's<00:05:57.000> going<00:05:57.240> to

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
twice as much for a shoe that's going to

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.690 
twice as much for a shoe that's going to
fall<00:05:57.479> apart<00:05:57.650> you'll<00:05:58.650> see<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:59.010> we've<00:05:59.160> got<00:05:59.340> row

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
fall apart you'll see that we've got row

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.659 
fall apart you'll see that we've got row
places<00:06:00.270> on<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:00.540> 2000<00:06:01.290> Edition<00:06:01.740> compared<00:06:02.520> with

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
Olympics and the 2012 Olympics so you

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.909 
Olympics and the 2012 Olympics so you
can<00:06:55.360> see<00:06:55.540> the<00:06:55.690> slight<00:06:56.050> differences<00:06:56.680> between

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
can see the slight differences between

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.520 
can see the slight differences between
the<00:06:57.280> two<00:06:57.460> but<00:06:58.150> like<00:06:58.449> I<00:06:58.600> said<00:06:58.660> it's<00:06:59.050> really<00:06:59.260> not

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
the two but like I said it's really not

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.409 
the two but like I said it's really not
worth<00:06:59.800> paying<00:07:00.130> twice<00:07:00.430> as<00:07:00.669> much<00:07:00.880> for<00:07:01.150> a<00:07:01.180> shoe

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
worth paying twice as much for a shoe

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.020 
worth paying twice as much for a shoe
just<00:07:02.050> because<00:07:02.350> they<00:07:02.470> made<00:07:02.680> 3,000<00:07:03.550> pairs<00:07:03.790> of

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
just because they made 3,000 pairs of

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.580 
just because they made 3,000 pairs of
them<00:07:04.180> when<00:07:04.690> you<00:07:04.720> can<00:07:04.960> get<00:07:05.080> a<00:07:05.139> shoe<00:07:05.380> like<00:07:05.560> this

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
them when you can get a shoe like this

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.100 
them when you can get a shoe like this
that<00:07:06.010> you<00:07:06.130> can<00:07:06.160> rock<00:07:06.639> so<00:07:07.090> there<00:07:07.540> you<00:07:07.630> go<00:07:07.810> three

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
that you can rock so there you go three

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.750 
that you can rock so there you go three
reasons<00:07:08.620> why<00:07:08.770> I've<00:07:08.979> decided<00:07:09.160> to<00:07:09.460> sell<00:07:09.729> my

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
reasons why I've decided to sell my

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.120 
reasons why I've decided to sell my
shoes
