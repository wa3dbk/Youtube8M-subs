Benny's<00:03:17.470> half-step<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:21.310> you're<00:03:21.790> up

Benny's half-step and as you're up

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.780 
Benny's half-step and as you're up
you're<00:03:22.569> hitting<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.260> 13th<00:03:23.800> fret<00:03:24.069> on<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> high<00:03:24.640> E

you're hitting a 13th fret on the high E
string<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:29.709> did<00:03:29.980> almost<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.060> before

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
string you did almost like that before

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.660 
string you did almost like that before
you<00:03:31.599> just<00:03:31.780> did<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> whole<00:03:32.349> band<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:33.430> you're

that thing the last thing slowly they

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.569 
that thing the last thing slowly they
can<00:03:56.019> hit<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.349> both<00:03:56.560> strings<00:03:57.010> if<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.370> want

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579

can hit the both strings if you want
like<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:59.560> doesn't<00:03:59.860> really<00:04:00.130> matter<00:04:00.519> just

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
like this it doesn't really matter just

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.120

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
sometimes sometimes to bolster nice

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.140 
sometimes sometimes to bolster nice
depends<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:10.260> anyway<00:04:11.610> now<00:04:12.610> we're<00:04:12.819> gonna<00:04:12.970> do

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150

then you pick it again and as you pick
it<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:43.080> do<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.440> pull<00:04:43.800> out<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:48.510> gotta<00:04:48.690> just

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
it you do a pull out so you gotta just

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:58.430 
it you do a pull out so you gotta just
keep<00:04:49.199> this<00:04:49.440> finger<00:04:49.740> there<00:04:50.250> all<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.820> time<00:04:57.440> like

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
keep this finger there all the time like

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.430 
keep this finger there all the time like
that<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.810> now<00:05:00.810> comes<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.530> tricky<00:05:02.130> part<00:05:03.440> goes

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
that and now comes a tricky part goes

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.659 
that and now comes a tricky part goes
like<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:08.030> now<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.210> can<00:05:09.479> be<00:05:09.600> hard<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:10.669> master

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
like this now that can be hard to master

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.370 
like this now that can be hard to master
in<00:05:12.510> full-speed<00:05:13.580> but<00:05:14.580> just<00:05:14.910> practice<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.930> you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
in full-speed but just practice and you

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.439 
in full-speed but just practice and you
will<00:05:16.650> make<00:05:16.919> it

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
will make it

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.890 
will make it
now<00:05:18.449> you<00:05:18.510> how<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.780> do<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.199> is<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.389> pick

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
now you how you do that is you do pick

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.710 
now you how you do that is you do pick
twice<00:05:22.289> on<00:05:22.650> 16th<00:05:23.580> fret<00:05:23.880> on<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.180> B<00:05:24.389> string<00:05:24.539> and

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
twice on 16th fret on the B string and

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.750 
twice on 16th fret on the B string and
then<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.930> go<00:05:28.349> to<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.740> 13th<00:05:29.250> fret<00:05:29.400> on<00:05:29.550> the

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
then you go to the 13th fret on the

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.339 
then you go to the 13th fret on the
highest<00:05:30.680> right<00:05:31.680> back<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.400> they<00:05:35.580> do<00:05:35.639> it<00:05:35.880> again

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
highest right back and they do it again

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.000 
highest right back and they do it again
if<00:05:37.349> you<00:05:37.500> do<00:05:37.650> that<00:05:37.830> twice<00:05:38.870> now<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.110> sounds<00:05:40.770> in

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
if you do that twice now that sounds in

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:47.810 
if you do that twice now that sounds in
full<00:05:41.490> speed<00:05:41.849> like<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:46.010> so<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.340> can<00:05:47.610> be<00:05:47.789> a

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
full speed like this so it can be a

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.210 
full speed like this so it can be a
little<00:05:48.030> bit<00:05:48.210> tricky<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:48.690> get<00:05:48.960> but<00:05:49.620> as

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
little bit tricky to get but as

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.790 
little bit tricky to get but as
everything<00:05:50.940> else<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.660> guitar<00:05:52.050> playing<00:05:52.349> and

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
everything else in guitar playing and

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.650 
everything else in guitar playing and
probably<00:05:53.280> everything<00:05:53.789> else<00:05:53.970> in<00:05:54.180> life<00:05:54.210> you

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
probably everything else in life you

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.779 
probably everything else in life you
just<00:05:54.690> practice<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:55.889> you<00:05:55.979> will<00:05:56.010> get<00:05:56.280> it<00:05:57.710> and

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
just practice and you will get it and

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.260 
just practice and you will get it and
then<00:05:59.789> you<00:05:59.970> end<00:06:00.270> up<00:06:00.419> in<00:06:00.660> this<00:06:00.870> note<00:06:02.240> which<00:06:03.240> is

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
then you end up in this note which is

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.230 
then you end up in this note which is
the<00:06:03.570> 13th<00:06:04.110> fret<00:06:04.349> on<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.800> B<00:06:05.039> string<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.880> after

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
the 13th fret on the B string so after

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.350 
the 13th fret on the B string so after
you've<00:06:06.360> done<00:06:06.389> this

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
you've done this

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.999 
you've done this
you<00:06:09.360> go<00:06:09.539> to<00:06:09.599> that<00:06:09.750> notes<00:06:10.229> may<00:06:10.590> sound<00:06:10.860> a<00:06:10.979> little

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
you go to that notes may sound a little

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.070 
you go to that notes may sound a little
bit<00:06:11.870> funny<00:06:12.870> or<00:06:13.259> weird<00:06:13.469> but<00:06:14.389> we<00:06:15.389> get<00:06:15.599> to<00:06:15.750> feel

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
bit funny or weird but we get to feel

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.070 
bit funny or weird but we get to feel
when<00:06:16.439> you're<00:06:16.680> playing<00:06:17.430> it<00:06:17.789> in<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.960> know<00:06:19.050> a

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
when you're playing it in you know a

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.950 
when you're playing it in you know a
little<00:06:19.259> bit<00:06:19.710> faster<00:06:20.280> now<00:06:20.569> we're<00:06:21.569> gonna<00:06:21.750> do

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
little bit faster now we're gonna do

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:30.290 
little bit faster now we're gonna do
something<00:06:22.349> like<00:06:22.469> this<00:06:28.460> now<00:06:29.460> how<00:06:29.759> you<00:06:29.789> do<00:06:30.090> that

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
something like this now how you do that

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.140 
something like this now how you do that
this<00:06:31.020> is<00:06:32.030> it's<00:06:33.030> basically<00:06:33.509> by<00:06:34.139> doing<00:06:34.759> it<00:06:35.759> full

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
this is it's basically by doing it full

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.730 
this is it's basically by doing it full
band<00:06:36.449> on<00:06:37.259> the<00:06:37.949> to<00:06:38.879> show<00:06:39.060> you<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.419> 15th<00:06:40.229> fret<00:06:40.500> on
