best expectations you guys have got of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.750 
best expectations you guys have got of
this<00:02:21.460> way

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this way

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.250 
this way
is<00:02:21.909> it<00:02:22.030> reaching<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.360> semi-finals<00:02:22.629> is<00:02:23.140> it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
is it reaching the semi-finals is it

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.300 
is it reaching the semi-finals is it
getting<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> final<00:02:23.950> what<00:02:24.069> would<00:02:24.189> be<00:02:24.280> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
getting to the final what would be a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.059 
getting to the final what would be a
success<00:02:24.700> at<00:02:25.629> least<00:02:25.870> ops<00:02:26.079> 3<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.319> guess<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.799> I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
success at least ops 3 I guess but I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.050 
success at least ops 3 I guess but I
think<00:02:27.159> that<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:29.230> never<00:02:29.980> came<00:02:30.129> in<00:02:30.280> day<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.819> teams

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
think that I never came in day the teams

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.089 
think that I never came in day the teams
in<00:02:31.209> our<00:02:31.299> group<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.750> feed<00:02:31.900> each<00:02:32.019> other<00:02:32.140> we

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
in our group can feed each other we

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.899 
in our group can feed each other we
don't<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.860> will<00:02:35.980> be<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.129> disaster<00:02:36.489> to

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
don't have to it will be a disaster to

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.390 
don't have to it will be a disaster to
underestimate<00:02:37.450> any<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> teams<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:39.340> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
underestimate any of the teams but I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280 
underestimate any of the teams but I
guess<00:02:39.670> people<00:02:39.909> see<00:02:40.360> us<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> favorite<00:02:41.170> in

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
guess people see us as a favorite in

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.920 
guess people see us as a favorite in
this<00:02:41.440> group<00:02:41.739> but<00:02:42.329> we<00:02:43.329> definitely<00:02:43.540> need<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this group but we definitely need to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.780 
this group but we definitely need to
play<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.260> play<00:02:44.590> our<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> game<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.459> want<00:02:45.730> to

win this and our first game is against
Moscow<00:02:49.810> 5<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:50.680> know<00:02:50.799> that<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.280> first

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
Moscow 5 and you know that in the first

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.920 
Moscow 5 and you know that in the first
games<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:51.939> be<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.299> bit<00:02:52.450> shaky<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
games you can be a little bit shaky and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.869 
games you can be a little bit shaky and
you<00:02:53.049> need<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.319> get<00:02:53.769> used<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.129> the<00:02:54.430> set<00:02:54.609> up<00:02:54.730> and

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
you need to get used to the set up and

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.479 
you need to get used to the set up and
stuff<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:57.010> can<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> really

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
stuff like that so it can be a really

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.610 
stuff like that so it can be a really
tough<00:02:57.730> match<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.209> if<00:02:58.359> we<00:02:58.510> lose<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.720> one<00:02:59.109> it's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
tough match and if we lose this one it's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.110 
tough match and if we lose this one it's
going<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.859> be<00:02:59.920> really<00:03:00.099> tough<00:03:00.340> yeah<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.940> last

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
going to be really tough yeah the last

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.430 
going to be really tough yeah the last
two<00:03:01.239> times<00:03:01.510> you've<00:03:01.840> played<00:03:02.079> these<00:03:02.230> guys

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
two times you've played these guys

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
two times you've played these guys
you've<00:03:02.650> lost<00:03:02.829> both<00:03:03.069> games<00:03:03.099> they<00:03:03.609> were<00:03:03.730> New

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you've lost both games they were New

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.729 
you've lost both games they were New
York<00:03:04.239> qualify<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.690> they<00:03:04.959> cared<00:03:05.379> qualifier

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
York qualify and they cared qualifier

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.229 
York qualify and they cared qualifier
obviously<00:03:06.069> this<00:03:06.220> does<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.849> play<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.120> your

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
obviously this does that play on your

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.369 
obviously this does that play on your
mind<00:03:07.480> when<00:03:07.599> you<00:03:07.659> go<00:03:07.780> into<00:03:07.870> these<00:03:07.989> games<00:03:08.230> or

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
mind when you go into these games or

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.720 
mind when you go into these games or
just<00:03:08.409> put<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.799> out<00:03:08.859> anything<00:03:09.280> no<00:03:09.459> we're<00:03:09.639> gonna

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
just put it out anything no we're gonna

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.849 
just put it out anything no we're gonna
just<00:03:09.940> take<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.269> as<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.389> comes<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:11.530> really

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
just take it as it comes not really

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.430 
just take it as it comes not really
because<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:13.569> key<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.750> qualified<00:03:14.200> when<00:03:14.349> we

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
because in the key of qualified when we

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.399 
because in the key of qualified when we
lost<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.739> Moscow<00:03:15.040> 5<00:03:15.220> we<00:03:15.459> played<00:03:15.670> nuke<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.090> we

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
lost to Moscow 5 we played nuke and we

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.800 
lost to Moscow 5 we played nuke and we
hadn't<00:03:17.409> even<00:03:17.440> looked<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.549> map<00:03:18.700> yet<00:03:18.970> back

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
hadn't even looked at the map yet back

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.289 
hadn't even looked at the map yet back
then<00:03:20.049> we<00:03:20.650> only<00:03:20.799> practiced<00:03:21.069> us<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.730> infernal

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
then we only practiced us to infernal

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.259 
then we only practiced us to infernal
and<00:03:22.389> we<00:03:22.480> won<00:03:22.629> against<00:03:22.870> Navi<00:03:23.109> on<00:03:23.260> those<00:03:23.409> two<00:03:23.560> so

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
and we won against Navi on those two so

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.300 
and we won against Navi on those two so
now<00:03:25.269> we<00:03:25.329> are<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:26.049> bit<00:03:26.260> more<00:03:26.680> prepared<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:27.129> nuke

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
now we are a bit more prepared on nuke

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.849 
now we are a bit more prepared on nuke
so<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.510> guess<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:29.349> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> be<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> whole

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
so I guess that it's going to be a whole

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.339 
so I guess that it's going to be a whole
different<00:03:29.889> game<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.579> we<00:03:30.699> lost<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:31.150> 16<00:03:31.900> 13

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
different game and we lost like 16 13

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.400 
different game and we lost like 16 13
and<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:32.709> had<00:03:32.799> no<00:03:32.829> tactic<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.349> said

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
and we had no tactic so like I said

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.930 
and we had no tactic so like I said
before<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.919> don't<00:03:35.949> have<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.340> underestimate

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
before we don't have to underestimate

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.330 
before we don't have to underestimate
them<00:03:37.150> even<00:03:37.599> though<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> sound<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.139> bit<00:03:38.169> like<00:03:38.340> ya

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
them even though I sound a bit like ya

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.409 
them even though I sound a bit like ya
there<00:03:39.970> but<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.799> gonna<00:03:41.949> be<00:03:42.099> tough<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.819> can

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
there but it's gonna be tough but I can

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.659 
there but it's gonna be tough but I can
see<00:03:43.569> us<00:03:43.599> getting<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.109> kg<00:03:44.859> when<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.519> said

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
see us getting the kg when you said

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.309 
see us getting the kg when you said
earlier<00:03:45.699> teasing<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.599> tournament<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.019> one

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
earlier teasing this tournament is one

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.199 
earlier teasing this tournament is one
tournament<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.919> earlier<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.970> sort<00:03:49.150> of

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
tournament to earlier you you sort of

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.699 
tournament to earlier you you sort of
working<00:03:49.419> towards<00:03:49.900> maybe<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.139> grand<00:03:50.349> finals

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
working towards maybe the grand finals

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.250 
working towards maybe the grand finals
it's<00:03:50.859> a<00:03:50.980> bear<00:03:51.160> in<00:03:51.250> March<00:03:51.690> yeah<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.810> course<00:03:53.079> I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
it's a bear in March yeah of course I

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.470 
it's a bear in March yeah of course I
would<00:03:53.379> rather<00:03:53.500> winning<00:03:54.129> March<00:03:54.370> then<00:03:54.639> now<00:03:55.180> but

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
would rather winning March then now but

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.890 
would rather winning March then now but
I<00:03:55.930> guess<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.739> we<00:03:56.829> can<00:03:57.010> grow<00:03:57.370> with<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.900> grow

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
I guess that we can grow with the grow

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.920 
I guess that we can grow with the grow
in<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.410> tournament<00:03:59.859> if<00:04:00.760> we<00:04:01.180> win<00:04:01.359> or<00:04:01.660> get

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
in the tournament if we win or get

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.629 
in the tournament if we win or get
through<00:04:02.199> this<00:04:02.379> these<00:04:02.650> group<00:04:02.889> stages<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.310> think

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
through this these group stages I think

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.390 
through this these group stages I think
there<00:04:03.790> will<00:04:03.879> be<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:04.079> lot<00:04:05.079> better<00:04:05.230> team<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.709> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
there will be a lot better team in the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.069 
there will be a lot better team in the
playoffs<00:04:06.549> then<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.299> then<00:04:07.419> we<00:04:07.510> are<00:04:07.629> now<00:04:07.780> so

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
playoffs then and then we are now so

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.619 
playoffs then and then we are now so
hopefully<00:04:08.829> we<00:04:09.819> will<00:04:09.970> gain<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:10.569> much

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
hopefully we will gain so much

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.409 
hopefully we will gain so much
experience<00:04:10.959> but<00:04:11.680> these<00:04:12.370> three<00:04:12.879> matches<00:04:13.269> that

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
experience but these three matches that

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.080 
experience but these three matches that
will<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:14.079> a<00:04:14.109> top<00:04:14.680> team<00:04:14.859> again<00:04:15.099> in<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.849> playoffs

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
will be a top team again in the playoffs

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.930 
will be a top team again in the playoffs
