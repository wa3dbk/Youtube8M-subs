00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
night because I was so excited to see it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.360 
night because I was so excited to see it
Godzilla<00:03:52.790> movie<00:03:53.180> but<00:03:54.140> then<00:03:54.290> after<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.709> grew

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
Godzilla movie but then after I grew

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.460 
Godzilla movie but then after I grew
older<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.760> watched<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.360> again<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.720> few<00:03:57.020> times<00:03:57.230> I

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
older and watched it again a few times I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.460 
older and watched it again a few times I
don't<00:03:58.070> really<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.580> this<00:03:58.730> at<00:03:58.910> all<00:04:00.160> but<00:04:01.160> I

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
don't really like this at all but I

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.259 
don't really like this at all but I
liked<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.980> think<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.610> reason<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:04.910> didn't<00:04:05.120> like

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
liked I think the reason I didn't like

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.640 
liked I think the reason I didn't like
it<00:04:05.420> as<00:04:05.510> much<00:04:05.540> because<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.140> wasn't<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:06.530> the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
it as much because it wasn't like the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.680 
it as much because it wasn't like the
old<00:04:06.800> Godzilla<00:04:07.250> movies<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.450> didn't

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
old Godzilla movies like that didn't

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.740 
old Godzilla movies like that didn't
have<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.019> original<00:04:09.590> roar<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.750> didn't

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
have the original roar and it didn't

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.729 
have the original roar and it didn't
look<00:04:11.900> like<00:04:11.959> Godzilla<00:04:13.390> but<00:04:14.390> holy<00:04:15.290> crap<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
look like Godzilla but holy crap that

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.190 
look like Godzilla but holy crap that
one<00:04:16.130> did<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.760> mean<00:04:17.090> granted<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.690> looked<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.169> a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
one did I mean granted it looked like a

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.640 
one did I mean granted it looked like a
CGI<00:04:18.769> version<00:04:18.890> of<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:20.750> cheesy-looking

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
CGI version of the cheesy-looking
