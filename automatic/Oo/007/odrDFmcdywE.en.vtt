00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.329 
that'll be different about cars in 20
years<00:00:39.089> every<00:00:39.960> day<00:00:40.289> transportation<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
years every day transportation and

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.439 
years every day transportation and

different they're gonna be you know some
alternate<00:00:46.440> source<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.920> fuel<00:00:47.640> they'll

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
alternate source of fuel they'll

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.569 
alternate source of fuel they'll
probably<00:00:48.449> still<00:00:48.839> be<00:00:49.050> gasoline<00:00:50.039> cars<00:00:50.339> but

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
probably still be gasoline cars but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
probably still be gasoline cars but
there's<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> variety<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.469> different

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
believe they're still gonna be the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
believe they're still gonna be the
muscle<00:00:55.769> cars<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.370> hot<00:00:56.550> rods<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.149> vintage<00:00:57.690> cars

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
muscle cars or hot rods the vintage cars

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.559 
muscle cars or hot rods the vintage cars
that<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.769> know<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.089> people<00:01:00.089> are<00:01:00.210> attached

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
that you know that people are attached

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:02.689 
that you know that people are attached
to<00:01:00.780> emotionally<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.739> everybody<00:01:02.489> buys

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to emotionally because everybody buys

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.450 
to emotionally because everybody buys
cars<00:01:02.999> for<00:01:03.179> different<00:01:03.449> reasons<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.739> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
cars for different reasons but it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.860 
cars for different reasons but it's
playing<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.910> that<00:01:06.000> love<00:01:06.240> affair<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> car

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
playing with that love affair of the car

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.930 
playing with that love affair of the car
that's<00:01:07.380> never<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:07.950> away<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.550> believe

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
that's never gonna go away so I believe

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.840 
that's never gonna go away so I believe
that<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:10.020> vintage<00:01:10.320> car<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> real<00:01:10.920> estate<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that the vintage car is real estate in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
that the vintage car is real estate in
20<00:01:12.180> years<00:01:12.270> cars<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.750> gonna<00:01:12.870> look<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.170> what

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
20 years cars are gonna look like what

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.290 
20 years cars are gonna look like what
they<00:01:13.560> did<00:01:14.250> 20<00:01:14.640> years<00:01:14.820> ago

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
they did 20 years ago

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.030 
they did 20 years ago
I<00:01:15.510> think<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> comment<00:01:16.200> sexuals<00:01:16.830> will

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I think that comment sexuals will

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.100 
I think that comment sexuals will
continue<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.730> borrow<00:01:17.970> upon<00:01:18.360> style<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:18.870> fuse

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
continue to borrow upon style and fuse

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
continue to borrow upon style and fuse
from<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.380> past<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.160> they<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.300> got<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
from the past because they really got it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
from the past because they really got it
right<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.740> 50s<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.190> 60s

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
right back in the 50s and 60s

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.020 
right back in the 50s and 60s
cars<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.630> always<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.410> be<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:26.010> huge<00:01:26.640> part
