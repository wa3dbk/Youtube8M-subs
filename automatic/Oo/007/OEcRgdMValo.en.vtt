that was a pretty balanced attack really
yeah<00:05:30.169> so<00:05:31.169> there<00:05:31.589> we<00:05:31.739> go<00:05:31.939> photon<00:05:32.939> blast<00:05:33.299> of<00:05:33.689> zs

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
yeah so there we go photon blast of zs

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.659 
yeah so there we go photon blast of zs
