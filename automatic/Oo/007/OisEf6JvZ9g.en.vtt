device and i had a guitar teacher show

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
device and i had a guitar teacher show
to<00:00:50.579> me<00:00:50.850> probably<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.360> 10<00:00:51.660> years<00:00:51.840> ago<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to me probably about 10 years ago and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.380 
to me probably about 10 years ago and
now<00:00:52.949> i'm<00:00:53.070> passing<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> along<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.840 

basically<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.320> way<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
basically you can think of it this way a

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.200 
basically you can think of it this way a
G<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.270> root<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> B<00:01:00.840> string<00:01:00.899> G

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.859 

is<00:01:04.809> on<00:01:05.170> they<00:01:05.560> fret<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.970> there's<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.299> little<00:01:07.630> you

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
is on they fret and there's a little you

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.840 
is on they fret and there's a little you
know<00:01:07.900> there's<00:01:08.140> some<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.890> know<00:01:08.950> if<00:01:09.100> I<00:01:09.190> bend<00:01:09.549> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
know there's some you know if I bend the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.700 
know there's some you know if I bend the
tenth<00:01:10.150> fret<00:01:10.360> up<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:13.720> kind<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:13.930> just<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
tenth fret up we're kind of just in the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:24.090 
tenth fret up we're kind of just in the
g<00:01:15.250> major<00:01:15.550> pentatonic<00:01:16.180> right<00:01:16.540> here<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.009> can

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
g major pentatonic right here so you can

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.320 
g major pentatonic right here so you can
think<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.490> way<00:01:24.640> by<00:01:24.880> visualizing

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
think of it that way by visualizing

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.270 
think of it that way by visualizing
where<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> root<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.440> play<00:01:26.680> this<00:01:26.920> device

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
where the root is to play this device

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.600 
where the root is to play this device
down<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.080> root<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.500> like<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.250> said<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.520> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
down so the root is like I said on the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.210 
down so the root is like I said on the
8th<00:01:30.759> fret<00:01:31.090> e<00:01:31.270> we're<00:01:32.229> not<00:01:32.320> even<00:01:32.350> we're<00:01:32.920> not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
8th fret e we're not even we're not

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.070 
8th fret e we're not even we're not
starting<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.090> lick<00:01:34.270> with<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.659> just<00:01:34.899> want

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
starting to lick with that I just want

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.200 
starting to lick with that I just want
you<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.259> visualize<00:01:35.500> how<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.490> plug<00:01:36.759> this<00:01:36.910> in<00:01:37.090> in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
you to visualize how to plug this in in

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.359 
you to visualize how to plug this in in
different<00:01:37.539> keys<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.110> right<00:01:38.350> now<00:01:38.380> we're<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.009> G

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
different keys so right now we're in G

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.540 
different keys so right now we're in G
so<00:01:40.210> instead<00:01:41.080> of<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.979> know<00:01:42.009> my<00:01:42.160> ring<00:01:42.369> finger

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
so instead of a you know my ring finger

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.980 
so instead of a you know my ring finger
on<00:01:42.789> that<00:01:42.820> root<00:01:43.240> note<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.570> stone<00:01:43.780> with<00:01:43.960> I'm

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
on that root note to stone with I'm

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.080 
on that root note to stone with I'm
going<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.320> put<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.740> high<00:01:44.920> E<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.789> h<00:01:48.789> 2

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
going to put it on the high E on the h 2

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.020 
going to put it on the high E on the h 2
8th<00:01:49.270> fret<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.340> could<00:01:51.460> also<00:01:51.580> think<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.910> this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
8th fret so you could also think of this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
8th fret so you could also think of this
is<00:01:52.210> coming<00:01:52.509> from<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.690> D<00:01:53.050> shape<00:01:53.440> of<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.070> core<00:01:54.250> 2

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
is coming from the D shape of the core 2

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.109 
is coming from the D shape of the core 2
D<00:01:56.890> moved<00:01:57.280> up<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> G<00:01:57.850> chord<00:01:58.090> d<00:01:58.509> e<00:01:58.810> f<00:01:59.320> g<00:01:59.970> but<00:02:00.970> so

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
D moved up to a G chord d e f g but so

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.419 
D moved up to a G chord d e f g but so
ring<00:02:01.390> finger<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.920> can<00:02:03.009> use<00:02:03.159> your<00:02:03.280> middle

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
ring finger you can use your middle

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.749 
ring finger you can use your middle
finger<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.819> i'm<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.300> do<00:02:04.390> ring<00:02:04.600> finger<00:02:04.960> on

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
finger to i'm going to do ring finger on

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.120 
finger to i'm going to do ring finger on
the<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.789> threat<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:08.350> middle<00:02:08.769> finger<00:02:09.009> on<00:02:09.040> the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
the a threat and middle finger on the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:23.520 
the a threat and middle finger on the
7th<00:02:11.880> then<00:02:12.880> ring<00:02:13.299> finger<00:02:13.690> onto<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.140> beach

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.030 

so<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.590> goes<00:02:26.440> 878<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.760> B<00:02:28.940> string<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.920> 7<00:02:30.920> on

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
so it goes 878 on the B string then 7 on

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
so it goes 878 on the B string then 7 on
the<00:02:31.160> g<00:02:31.340> string<00:02:36.310> then<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.400> slide<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.180> same

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
the g string then I slide that same

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.920 
the g string then I slide that same
string<00:02:39.110> down<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.350> whole<00:02:39.620> step<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:41.090> 5th<00:02:41.810> fret

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
string down a whole step to the 5th fret

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.020 
string down a whole step to the 5th fret
