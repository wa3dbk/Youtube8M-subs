00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.590
 Get a free tshirt

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.820

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.599
 I was never able to play 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.140
 On the other hand, I wish the ocarina too 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.640
 to have 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.169
 the game is the anthem of the time travel in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.210
 ahead of time and then have the game 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.140
 today how can during the game 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.140
 objects in real life 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.800
 happy day friends is what freed at last from 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 cake is you have done 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.220
 but then it has to be small and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:55.820
 thankful little fucker 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:57.010

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.780
 no no this is from a video game 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.340
 does not bother me as a video game 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 we should maybe get this confiscated 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.880
 for scientific purposes 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.880

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.479

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.460
 wash out allegations come to me 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.530
 and we submit a documentation 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.810
 the biggest concerns about time travel 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.830

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:14.090
 lucky to get through you 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.090
