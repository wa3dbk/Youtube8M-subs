00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
okay this is a another large green

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.560 
okay this is a another large green
island<00:00:06.879> ficus<00:00:07.390> that<00:00:07.660> we<00:00:07.810> have<00:00:08.049> a<00:00:09.270> really<00:00:10.270> nice

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
island ficus that we have a really nice

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.100 
island ficus that we have a really nice
big<00:00:10.900> trunk<00:00:11.289> he<00:00:11.770> has<00:00:12.100> cut<00:00:12.520> off<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.900> of<00:00:13.930> the

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
big trunk he has cut off some of the

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.070 
big trunk he has cut off some of the
branches<00:00:14.680> you<00:00:14.980> can<00:00:15.459> see<00:00:15.879> all<00:00:16.119> around<00:00:16.480> and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
branches you can see all around and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.099 
branches you can see all around and
we're<00:00:17.859> going<00:00:17.949> to<00:00:18.039> be<00:00:18.160> grafting<00:00:18.789> this<00:00:19.000> tree<00:00:19.390> to

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
we're going to be grafting this tree to

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.349 
we're going to be grafting this tree to
give<00:00:20.259> it<00:00:20.410> some<00:00:20.679> lower<00:00:20.919> branches<00:00:21.640> that<00:00:21.939> is<00:00:22.119> much

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
give it some lower branches that is much

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
give it some lower branches that is much
needed<00:00:23.580> here's<00:00:24.580> some<00:00:24.789> of<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:24.970> pieces<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
needed here's some of the pieces and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:42.090 
needed here's some of the pieces and
we're<00:00:30.369> going<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.579> do<00:00:30.669> some<00:00:30.849> grafting<00:00:41.070> okay

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
we're going to do some grafting okay

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.190 
we're going to do some grafting okay
we're<00:00:42.430> here<00:00:42.580> back<00:00:42.790> with<00:00:43.060> the<00:00:43.180> green<00:00:43.420> island<00:00:43.900> a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
we're here back with the green island a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.220 
we're here back with the green island a
peg<00:00:45.030> grafting<00:00:48.150> we<00:00:49.150> have<00:00:49.390> done<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.630> couple<00:00:49.750> of

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
peg grafting we have done a couple of

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.900 
peg grafting we have done a couple of
them<00:00:50.380> already<00:00:50.560> we're<00:00:51.220> in<00:00:51.310> the<00:00:51.400> process<00:00:51.550> of

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
them already we're in the process of

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.300 
them already we're in the process of
doing<00:00:52.030> another<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.390> measure<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.040> caliper<00:00:57.040> of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
doing another you measure the caliper of

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.840 
doing another you measure the caliper of
the<00:00:57.910> piece<00:00:58.150> and<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.950> drill<00:01:00.340> a<00:01:00.370> hole<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
the piece and then you drill a hole the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.139 
the piece and then you drill a hole the
same<00:01:01.060> size<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.500> then<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.400> roots<00:01:06.670> go<00:01:06.909> in<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
same size and then the roots go in the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.880 
same size and then the roots go in the
soil<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:07.630> see<00:01:07.929> below<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:10.649> we've<00:01:11.649> done<00:01:11.829> a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
soil you see below and we've done a

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.700 
soil you see below and we've done a
couple<00:01:12.869> already<00:01:14.909> another<00:01:15.909> there<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:17.439> is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
couple already another there and this is

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.059 
couple already another there and this is
another<00:01:18.009> so<00:01:18.939> we're<00:01:19.149> giving<00:01:19.479> some<00:01:20.259> branches<00:01:20.829> on

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
another so we're giving some branches on

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.959 
another so we're giving some branches on
this<00:01:21.999> large<00:01:22.270> ficus<00:01:22.960> green<00:01:23.350> island<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.840> now

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
this large ficus green island see now

00:01:26.969 --> 00:02:03.090 
this large ficus green island see now
cut<00:01:27.969> some<00:01:28.149> branches<00:01:28.329> where<00:01:29.049> it<00:01:29.170> needed

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:03:06.790 

so<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.310> have<00:02:04.490> one<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.800> third<00:02:10.040> one

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.080 

might<00:03:07.800> hold<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:08.220> root<00:03:08.460> out<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.790> my<00:03:08.910> wife<00:03:09.060> for

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
might hold this root out of my wife for

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
might hold this root out of my wife for
a<00:03:09.300> sec<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:24.030> then<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.360> need<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.660> plant<00:03:24.930> these<00:03:25.200> in

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
a sec and then we need to plant these in

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:43.960 
a sec and then we need to plant these in
here<00:03:25.800> too

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:04:00.410 

can<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.060> throw<00:03:45.210> me<00:03:45.300> that<00:03:45.480> work<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.240> see

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
can you throw me that work so you see

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:50.990 
can you throw me that work so you see
they're<00:04:00.630> bearing<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:02.240> aerial<00:04:03.240> roots

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.620 

what<00:04:51.540> are<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.720> doing<00:04:51.960> why<00:04:52.220> I'm<00:04:53.220> just<00:04:53.540> empty<00:04:54.540> in

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
what are you doing why I'm just empty in

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.720 
what are you doing why I'm just empty in
making<00:04:55.170> a<00:04:55.230> hole<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.650> get<00:04:56.010> these<00:04:56.160> roots<00:04:56.490> down

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
making a hole so I get these roots down

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.340 
making a hole so I get these roots down
into<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.210> pot<00:04:59.330> the<00:05:00.330> roots<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.930> are<00:05:01.080> feeding

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
into the pot the roots that are feeding

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:14.660 
into the pot the roots that are feeding
our<00:05:01.650> graft<00:05:08.510> drench<00:05:09.510> it<00:05:09.720> up<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:14.130> has<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.610> be

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
our graft drench it up just has to be

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:44.159 
our graft drench it up just has to be
right<00:05:14.970> under

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.869 

are<00:05:45.169> we<00:05:45.289> graphing<00:05:45.740> anymore<00:05:46.039> that's<00:05:46.399> it<00:05:46.610> for

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
are we graphing anymore that's it for

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:55.209 
are we graphing anymore that's it for

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
updated to see how this green island

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.009 
updated to see how this green island
ficus<00:05:57.770> does
