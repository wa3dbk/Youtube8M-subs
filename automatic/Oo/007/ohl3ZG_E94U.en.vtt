00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.870
 then the good wave swims or climbs this 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.320
 video to show you my new cut of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.419
 hair because although as always I already have 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 recorded videos that I already have 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.960
 ready to upload them to the channel and I 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.160
 you will continue to see with the old hairstyle 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.099
 I wanted to show you the haircut 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.160
 because you are going to start watching me in videos 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.570
 new with this new haircut and no 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 you are going to ask me if I have cut the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 hair that if he has clarified that if I 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.740
 They put out wicks or what noses I've done 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.920
 so if I have actually cut myself 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.480
 the hair more then good nothing 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 I teach this is the haircut that to me 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.410
 I like it, it's better, it's shorter 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.960
 back as you see and more more 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.190
 long forward I've been some 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.980
 little tables to clear it up a bit 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.710
 there is that will be better 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.590
 not the one who barks but enters 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.549
 and nothing because that I show you the new 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.549
 look there is 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.229
 they're crashing melano now since you're 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.229
 here and you show the hairstyle from behind 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.580
 I'm seen from behind 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.000
 yes it is worth that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.310
 that's the haircut this is the color 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.150
 has given me a dark blond a 6.1 already 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.760
 as indicated in the video of the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.310
 hair dyes 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.200
 Well, the one who asked my hairdresser 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.510
 last that I kicked out and the truth is that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 I quite like how it is because it does not 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.350
 it is as dark as a chestnut 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.690
 there is a chestnut chestnut tree is usually 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 quite matte and a bit dark 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.510
 little sad not and it marks much more the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.680
 factions and does not shoot as much orange as 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.320
 they throw the browns 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.070
 although as my color base then that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 orange is coppery it is difficult 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.150
 eliminate that color base but good 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.460
 this tone the truth that I like a lot 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.580
 I do not know and you will tell me which one is yours 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.580
 opinion 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.230
 and this is my new girls and boys and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.720
 nothing more than that is a kind of 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.010
 advance so that you know then that already 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.110
 I cut my hair the way I like it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.250
 I'll start the year with my new 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.080
 look already renewed with renewed strength and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.760
 let's see what awaits us this 2013 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.440
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.440
