that<00:00:27.430> I<00:00:27.520> use<00:00:27.789> things<00:00:28.779> that<00:00:28.960> help<00:00:29.169> me<00:00:29.259> develop

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
that I use things that help me develop

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.750 
that I use things that help me develop
my<00:00:31.230> foot<00:00:32.280> technique<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:35.410> first<00:00:35.440> thing<00:00:35.890> this

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
my foot technique the first thing this

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.509 
my foot technique the first thing this
is<00:00:36.910> a<00:00:36.940> Tama<00:00:37.360> iron<00:00:37.750> Cobra<00:00:38.170> pedal<00:00:38.500> this<00:00:39.190> is<00:00:39.370> what

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
is a Tama iron Cobra pedal this is what

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.759 
is a Tama iron Cobra pedal this is what
I<00:00:39.550> use<00:00:39.910> but<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.870> first<00:00:41.050> thing<00:00:41.199> I<00:00:41.290> do<00:00:41.350> is

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
I use but the first thing I do is

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.130 
I use but the first thing I do is
there's<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.100> toe<00:00:42.339> stop<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.690> screws<00:00:43.930> onto

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
there's a toe stop and it screws onto

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.790 
there's a toe stop and it screws onto
the<00:00:45.120> footboard<00:00:46.120> right<00:00:46.360> here<00:00:46.690> what<00:00:47.350> I<00:00:47.379> do<00:00:47.500> is<00:00:47.710> I

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
the footboard right here what I do is I

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500 
the footboard right here what I do is I
take<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.040> off<00:00:48.220> as<00:00:48.640> soon<00:00:48.760> as<00:00:48.879> I<00:00:48.940> get<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.180> pedal

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
take that off as soon as I get the pedal

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.630 
take that off as soon as I get the pedal
the<00:00:49.710> reason<00:00:50.710> why<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:50.829> do<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.190> because<00:00:51.460> I

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
the reason why I do that is because I

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.549 
the reason why I do that is because I
use<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.000> kind<00:00:52.239> of<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.449> sliding<00:00:52.780> technique<00:00:53.320> and

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
use this kind of a sliding technique and

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.810 
use this kind of a sliding technique and
I<00:00:53.589> want<00:00:53.799> to<00:00:53.860> be<00:00:53.949> able<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.159> slide<00:00:54.369> as<00:00:54.580> far

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
I want to be able to slide as far

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.990 
I want to be able to slide as far
forward<00:00:55.059> as<00:00:55.330> possible<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:57.790> take<00:00:57.970> that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
forward as possible and you take that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.090 
forward as possible and you take that
toe<00:00:58.360> stop<00:00:58.720> off<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.199> this<00:00:59.439> allows<00:00:59.680> you<00:00:59.860> to<00:00:59.979> do

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
toe stop off and this allows you to do

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
toe stop off and this allows you to do
that<00:01:04.530> another<00:01:05.530> thing<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.920> use<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:06.340> baby<00:01:06.909> powder

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that another thing I use is baby powder

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.950 
that another thing I use is baby powder
why<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:09.159> ask<00:01:09.369> do<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:09.850> use<00:01:10.060> baby<00:01:10.270> powder<00:01:10.420> well

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
why you ask do I use baby powder well

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.039 
why you ask do I use baby powder well
I'll<00:01:11.229> tell<00:01:11.439> you<00:01:12.450> sometimes<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.600> bottom<00:01:13.930> of

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
I'll tell you sometimes the bottom of

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.429 
I'll tell you sometimes the bottom of
your<00:01:14.080> shoe<00:01:14.439> which<00:01:15.070> slides<00:01:15.460> on<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.759> pedal<00:01:16.439> gets

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
your shoe which slides on the pedal gets

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.399 
your shoe which slides on the pedal gets
sticky<00:01:17.979> or<00:01:18.189> wet<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.689> sticks<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.229> won't

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
sticky or wet and it sticks and it won't

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.380 
sticky or wet and it sticks and it won't
slide<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.430> had<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.759> figure<00:01:21.909> out<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.119> way<00:01:22.330> to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
slide so I had to figure out a way to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.590 
slide so I had to figure out a way to
use<00:01:23.670> excuse<00:01:24.670> me<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:24.850> had<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.000> figure<00:01:25.150> out<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:25.359> way

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
use excuse me I had to figure out a way

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.370 
use excuse me I had to figure out a way
to<00:01:25.859> have<00:01:26.859> that<00:01:26.890> not<00:01:27.189> happen<00:01:27.579> so<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.689> took<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
to have that not happen so I took the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.580 
to have that not happen so I took the
baby<00:01:29.499> powder<00:01:29.859> and<00:01:30.359> I<00:01:31.359> put<00:01:32.049> a<00:01:32.079> little<00:01:32.200> on<00:01:32.409> the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
carpet right by the pedal and then I put

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.770 
carpet right by the pedal and then I put
my<00:01:35.679> foot<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.340> there<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.270> kind<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.569> rub<00:01:37.749> it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
my foot in there and kind of rub it

around a little bit and then when I put
it<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.780> pedal<00:01:41.109> it<00:01:41.289> slides<00:01:42.009> forward<00:01:42.399> very

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
it on the pedal it slides forward very

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.609 
it on the pedal it slides forward very
easily<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:46.109> I'll<00:01:47.109> show<00:01:47.289> you<00:01:47.319> a<00:01:47.439> little

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
easily and I'll show you a little

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.359 
easily and I'll show you a little
exercise<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.520> use<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:49.710> basically<00:01:50.710> work<00:01:51.009> out<00:01:51.189> my

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
exercise I use to basically work out my

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.690 
exercise I use to basically work out my
foot<00:01:51.670> with<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.119> sort<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.479> technique<00:01:53.700> goes

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
foot with this sort of technique goes

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.530 
foot with this sort of technique goes
like<00:01:54.880> this

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
like this

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:06.820 
like this

so<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:09.300> pedal<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.899> way<00:02:10.740> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
so you can see the pedal the way it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
so you can see the pedal the way it
moves<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.460> way<00:02:11.520> my<00:02:11.670> foot<00:02:11.880> moves<00:02:12.120> across

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
moves and the way my foot moves across

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.390 
moves and the way my foot moves across
the<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.200> footboard<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.830> has<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.190> slide

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
the the footboard it has to slide

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.600 
the the footboard it has to slide
forward<00:02:16.520> another<00:02:17.520> technique<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.240> use<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
forward another technique that I use and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.230 
forward another technique that I use and
you<00:02:20.610> need<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.000> dry<00:02:22.640> foot<00:02:23.640> bottom<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
you need to have a dry foot bottom is

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.650 
you need to have a dry foot bottom is
the<00:02:25.020> heel<00:02:25.380> toe<00:02:25.680> technique<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.400> use<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.480> all

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the heel toe technique I use this all

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.780 
the heel toe technique I use this all
the<00:02:27.690> time<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.290> very<00:02:28.350> important<00:02:31.700> let<00:02:32.700> me

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the time and it's very important let me

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.710 
the time and it's very important let me
show<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.050> what<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.610> similar<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.570> what

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
show you what it is it's similar to what

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.140 
show you what it is it's similar to what
I<00:02:36.750> did<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> hi-hat<00:02:37.410> earlier<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
I did on the hi-hat earlier but on the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.630 
I did on the hi-hat earlier but on the
kick<00:02:39.330> drum<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.750> sounds<00:02:40.680> different<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.280> I'll

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
kick drum it sounds different and I'll

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
kick drum it sounds different and I'll
do<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.330> fast<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.989> then<00:02:43.140> I'll<00:02:43.260> slow<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.440> down

to<00:03:13.579> show<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.849> how<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.269> works<00:03:14.569> so<00:03:15.430> I'll<00:03:16.430> just

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
to show you how this works so I'll just

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:40.750 
to show you how this works so I'll just
play<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.819> goes<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.329> this<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:39.639> what's<00:03:40.639> nice

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
play it goes like this so what's nice

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.809 
play it goes like this so what's nice
about<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:43.040> has<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.459> kind<00:03:43.639> of<00:03:43.730> a

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
about that is it has this kind of a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.580 
about that is it has this kind of a
swing<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.329> it<00:03:44.359> also<00:03:44.629> it's<00:03:45.019> different<00:03:45.379> than

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
swing to it also it's different than

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.920 
swing to it also it's different than
just<00:03:45.769> hitting<00:03:46.190> all<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.459> strokes<00:03:46.670> down<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.900> I

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
just hitting all the strokes down when I

the next thing I want to talk about is
an<00:04:40.510> exercise<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.100> was<00:04:42.100> really<00:04:42.430> helpful<00:04:42.729> in

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
an exercise that was really helpful in

strengthening my foot technique the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.760 
strengthening my foot technique the
first<00:04:45.940> thing<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.449> do<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:47.199> you<00:04:47.380> take<00:04:47.590> the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
first thing you do is you take the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.460 
first thing you do is you take the
spring<00:04:48.100> off<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.639> pedal

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
spring off the pedal

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.800 
spring off the pedal
now<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.530> beater<00:04:50.889> as<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.880> can<00:04:52.030> see<00:04:52.240> is

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
now the beater as you can see is

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.110 
now the beater as you can see is
floating<00:04:53.350> freely<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.030> you're<00:04:55.030> probably

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
floating freely and you're probably

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.439 
floating freely and you're probably
wondering<00:04:55.350> how<00:04:56.350> this<00:04:56.590> works<00:04:56.889> well<00:04:57.430> I'll<00:04:58.270> show

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:05.129 
wondering how this works well I'll show
you<00:05:01.199> take<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.320> spring<00:05:02.590> off<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.889> pedal<00:05:04.139> and

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
you take the spring off the pedal and

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:15.700 
you take the spring off the pedal and
this<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.440> what<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.590> do<00:05:07.139> here<00:05:08.139> we<00:05:08.229> go

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.880 

I<00:05:17.200> don't<00:05:18.200> know<00:05:18.260> if<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.380> can<00:05:18.530> tell<00:05:18.680> what's

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
going on but if you don't pick your foot

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.980 
going on but if you don't pick your foot
up<00:05:21.110> off<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.560> pedal<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.760> beater<00:05:23.030> will<00:05:23.480> stay<00:05:23.750> on

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
up off the pedal the beater will stay on

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.750 
up off the pedal the beater will stay on
the<00:05:24.140> bass<00:05:24.320> drum<00:05:24.350> head<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:24.920> it<00:05:25.100> forces<00:05:25.460> you<00:05:25.730> to

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
the bass drum head so it forces you to

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
the bass drum head so it forces you to
pick<00:05:26.360> that<00:05:26.510> foot<00:05:26.810> up<00:05:26.960> off<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.290> pedal<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:28.780> get

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
pick that foot up off the pedal and get

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.810 
pick that foot up off the pedal and get
your<00:05:30.020> foot<00:05:30.260> off<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.740> pedal<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:31.190> that's

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
your foot off the pedal and that's

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.980 
your foot off the pedal and that's
that's<00:05:32.240> what<00:05:32.420> I'm<00:05:32.510> trying<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.840> develop

that's what I'm trying to develop

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.020 
that's what I'm trying to develop
because<00:05:33.860> there's<00:05:34.040> muscles<00:05:34.460> in<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.700> front<00:05:34.940> of

because there's muscles in the front of
your<00:05:35.090> leg<00:05:35.300> here<00:05:35.540> that<00:05:35.810> are<00:05:35.960> very<00:05:36.170> difficult<00:05:36.440> to

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
your leg here that are very difficult to

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.460 
your leg here that are very difficult to
isolate<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.550> strengthen<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.300> this<00:05:38.900> exercise

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
isolate and strengthen and this exercise

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.030 
isolate and strengthen and this exercise
will<00:05:40.570> isolate<00:05:41.570> these<00:05:42.110> muscles<00:05:42.530> strengthen

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
will isolate these muscles strengthen

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.010 
will isolate these muscles strengthen
them<00:05:43.220> it's<00:05:43.670> kind<00:05:43.970> of<00:05:44.030> painful<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.690> kind<00:05:44.900> of

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020
