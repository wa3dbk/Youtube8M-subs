00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.700
 To date, there is evidence only in the area of ​​thermal effects 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.290
 on effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.400
 on the human organism 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.739
 to safely exclude hazards 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.929
 mobilkom Austria is based on the limits that the 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.929
 World Health Organization for network operation 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.679
 There are critical scientists who keep claiming that 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.910
 Limits are too high 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.860
 TuS Kriftel ministry had let written sources set up the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.699
 also with these critical studies 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.280
 disputes and it came to the conclusion that includes 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.459
 Limits as they currently pull in Poland Kenny danger exists and therefore 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.659
 75 7 million policy and the authority 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.609
 that makes 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.819
 However, we do not like to continue researching the development 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.219
 continue to observe and respond immediately brings science 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.810
 Clues to be understood and clear evidence of this 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 provides that the limits are actually too high 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.240
 measured the performance of a Wittenberg mobile communications system 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.729
 the total energy of the antenna is measured in relation to the energy 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.730
 Distance as performance plus density 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.240
 in watts per square meter 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.680
 The basis for the evaluation of a biological effect is ultimately 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.250
 The energy absorbed by the body is the NBAD per kilogram of body weight 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.160
 is given the so-called specific absorption rate or 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.560
 Castrop explains 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.690
 on the basis of scientific experiments one noticed 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.850
 a temperature increase in biological tissue is one degree Celsius 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.080
 Safe that explains a meal 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 4 watts per kilogram of body weight 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.570
 to a maximum warming of the fabric well below zero comma a degree too 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.260
 The SAP r is not allowed to limit 2 watts per kilogram of body weight 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.340
 exceed 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.049
 this leaves the company well below the threshold 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.049
 marked as harmless 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.690
 because it is difficult for obvious reasons, the warming of the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.810
 Population to eat the detour the most efficient I go to 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.400
 determine 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.269
 in which the field strength Miss Teen Wolf per meter 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.689
 also for the field strength there are limits that ensure that the SH 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.789
 is adhered to 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.389
 but why are the limits given in watts per square meter at the 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.389
 gsm networks and different in UMTS 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.339
 the absorption and thus the warming in the body is dependent on the 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:35.439
 frequency 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.059
 because with higher frequency are less absorbed by the body therefore 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.849
 the limits of the different accents differ 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.289
 Photo DS has always stated the same 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.419
 the limit of gsm networks is 4 point five and nine degrees per 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.489
 square meters 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.590
 for the Frick pension and thus less resulted in umts network 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.369
 10 watts per square meter 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:01.079
 All these limits ensure that the SWR limit is always met 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.359
 becomes 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.269
 the World Health Organization WHO advocates protection for the international commission 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.039
 Non-ionizing rays are based on their limit recommendations 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.099
 on scientifically based studies 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.410
 Therefore, one can be sure that in compliance with the limits also 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.349
 sensitive persons and children are adequately protected
