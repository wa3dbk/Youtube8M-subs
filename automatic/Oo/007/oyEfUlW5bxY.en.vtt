00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
okay so we got the inside dimensions of

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.459 
okay so we got the inside dimensions of
the<00:00:09.150> C<00:00:09.420> notch<00:00:09.600> cut<00:00:10.969> got<00:00:11.969> everything<00:00:12.360> dialed<00:00:13.170> in

the C notch cut got everything dialed in

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
the C notch cut got everything dialed in
so<00:00:13.709> it<00:00:13.860> fits<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:14.430> nice<00:00:14.639> there's<00:00:15.150> not<00:00:15.299> a

areas around the weld put it in a little
bit<00:00:28.350> of<00:00:28.440> a<00:00:28.530> bevel<00:00:29.030> so<00:00:30.030> we<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.300> good<00:00:30.480> weld

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
bit of a bevel so we get good weld

the milk this is this gray coding

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.530 
the milk this is this gray coding
it's<00:00:37.590> called<00:00:37.829> mill<00:00:38.130> scale<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:39.150> just<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it's called mill scale it's just like a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
it's called mill scale it's just like a
heat<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:41.660> generated<00:00:42.660> scale<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.980> comes

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
heat kind of generated scale that comes

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
heat kind of generated scale that comes
on<00:00:44.370> pretty<00:00:44.610> much<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.910> steel<00:00:45.270> products<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.020> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
on pretty much all steel products I like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.530 
on pretty much all steel products I like
to<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.130> off<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.700> grind<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.120> off<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.390> there

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
to take it off to grind it off of there

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.490 
to take it off to grind it off of there
it's<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.380> imperative<00:00:50.040> did<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it's not imperative did you do it but it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.060 
it's not imperative did you do it but it
does<00:00:52.739> help<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> quality<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> weld<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
does help the quality of the weld and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.790 
does help the quality of the weld and
the<00:00:56.329> appearance<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.510> weld<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.649> gonna

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the appearance of the weld so I'm gonna

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
the appearance of the weld so I'm gonna
come<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.190> everywhere<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.880> gonna<00:01:00.420> be

way around get on the underside I'm
probably<00:01:33.959> gonna<00:01:34.229> even<00:01:34.469> lay<00:01:34.679> some<00:01:34.889> weld<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
probably gonna even lay some weld and

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.580 
probably gonna even lay some weld and

not sure if I'm going to do it on the

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.359 
not sure if I'm going to do it on the
inside<00:01:40.639> in<00:01:41.639> this<00:01:41.909> area<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> most<00:01:44.219> definitely

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
inside in this area but most definitely

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.629 
inside in this area but most definitely
on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.819> outside<00:01:45.209> here<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.799> also<00:01:46.950> ground

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
on the outside here so and I also ground

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.999 
on the outside here so and I also ground
in<00:01:47.819> just<00:01:48.209> a<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.599> of<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.779> chamfer<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
in just a little bit of a chamfer or a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.330 
in just a little bit of a chamfer or a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
bevel if that's what you want to call it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
bevel if that's what you want to call it
just<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.429> allow<00:01:53.609> for<00:01:53.849> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:53.969> bit<00:01:54.240> more<00:01:54.450> weld

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
just to allow for a little bit more weld

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.489 
just to allow for a little bit more weld
penetration<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:57.119> over<00:01:57.539> here<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:58.380> the

penetration and over here on the

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:03.440 
penetration and over here on the
workbench<00:01:58.859> I<00:01:59.749> cleaned<00:02:00.749> up<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:01.429> C<00:02:02.429> notch<00:02:02.639> I<00:02:02.969> got

workbench I cleaned up my C notch I got
all<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.899> mill<00:02:04.109> scale<00:02:04.259> off<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:05.099> the<00:02:05.429> areas<00:02:05.819> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
all the mill scale off in the areas that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.630 
all the mill scale off in the areas that
I'm<00:02:06.810> gonna<00:02:06.959> weld<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.349> I<00:02:07.679> have<00:02:08.250> been<00:02:08.280> ground

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I'm gonna weld on I have been ground

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.780 
I'm gonna weld on I have been ground
down<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.360> inside<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.160> seam

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
down the inside here this is a seam

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.960 
down the inside here this is a seam
welded<00:02:12.710> tubing<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:13.920> there<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> seam<00:02:14.610> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
welded tubing so there is a seam a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.040 
welded tubing so there is a seam a
welded<00:02:15.900> seam<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.560> along<00:02:16.770> here

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
welded seam right along here

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.240 
welded seam right along here
so<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.320> ground<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.680> smiteth<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.190> to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
so I just ground that smiteth just to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.820 
so I just ground that smiteth just to
have<00:02:18.400> some<00:02:18.550> uniformity<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.900> piece<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
have some uniformity and the piece and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.380 
have some uniformity and the piece and
another<00:02:21.370> thing<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.640> did<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> piece<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.240> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
another thing I did the piece that I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.910 
another thing I did the piece that I
actually<00:02:22.540> cut<00:02:22.930> off<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> piece<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
actually cut off this is a piece of the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.310 
actually cut off this is a piece of the
frame<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.490> actually<00:02:25.330> ground<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.810> smooth<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
frame I actually ground that smooth and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.910 
frame I actually ground that smooth and
put<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.350> little<00:02:29.560> bevel<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:32.560> this

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
put a little bevel in that and this this

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.440 
put a little bevel in that and this this
is<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> piece<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.120> cut<00:02:34.420> off<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.180> C

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
is the piece that I cut off of the C

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.810 
is the piece that I cut off of the C
notch<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.020> what<00:02:38.170> made<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.520> an<00:02:39.520> actual

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
notch this is what made it an actual

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.300 
notch this is what made it an actual
piece<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.060> rectangular<00:02:40.540> tubing<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.170> ground<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
piece of rectangular tubing I ground the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610 
piece of rectangular tubing I ground the
mill<00:02:42.490> scale<00:02:42.670> off<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.990> because<00:02:44.350> what<00:02:44.530> I'm

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
mill scale off of that because what I'm

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.410 
mill scale off of that because what I'm
gonna<00:02:44.710> do<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.940> how<00:02:46.060> I'm<00:02:46.210> going<00:02:46.360> to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
gonna do is this is how I'm going to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.110 
gonna do is this is how I'm going to
prepare<00:02:46.990> my<00:02:47.170> welder<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:48.250> get<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.550> wire<00:02:48.730> speed

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
prepare my welder and get the wire speed

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.170 
prepare my welder and get the wire speed
and<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.830> voltage<00:02:51.220> set<00:02:51.460> correctly<00:02:51.910> I'm<00:02:52.060> going

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
and the voltage set correctly I'm going

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.140 
and the voltage set correctly I'm going
to<00:02:52.240> do<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.540> few<00:02:52.810> practice<00:02:53.700> little<00:02:54.700> beads<00:02:54.910> on

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
to do a few practice little beads on

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.020 
to do a few practice little beads on
here<00:02:55.390> just<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> make<00:02:55.900> sure<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.110> get<00:02:56.230> everything

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
here just to make sure I get everything

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.090 
here just to make sure I get everything
correct<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.690> since<00:02:58.990> I'm<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.680> know<00:02:59.770> this<00:02:59.950> is

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
correct and since I'm you know this is

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.550 
correct and since I'm you know this is
the<00:03:00.250> original<00:03:00.580> frame<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:01.150> mean<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
the original frame I mean this is the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.070 
the original frame I mean this is the
exact<00:03:02.950> thickness<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.520> metal<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.930> two

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
exact thickness of metal the two

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.840 
exact thickness of metal the two
thicknesses<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.890> metal<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.310> frames<00:03:06.610> about

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
thicknesses of metal this frames about

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.240 
thicknesses of metal this frames about
eight<00:03:07.030> inch<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:08.260> two<00:03:08.440> thicknesses<00:03:08.710> of<00:03:09.040> metal

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
eight inch the two thicknesses of metal

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.470 
eight inch the two thicknesses of metal
that<00:03:09.310> I'm<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.610> be<00:03:09.700> welding<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.360> this

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
that I'm going to be welding to so this

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.070 
that I'm going to be welding to so this
is<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.630> great<00:03:11.040> little<00:03:12.040> way<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.310> dial<00:03:13.240> in<00:03:13.480> your

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
is a great little way to dial in your

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.310 
is a great little way to dial in your
welder<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.060> because<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.450> important<00:03:16.870> it's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
welder and because it's important it's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.770 
welder and because it's important it's
very<00:03:17.560> very<00:03:17.830> important<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> do<00:03:18.780> some

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
very very important that you do some

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.240 
very very important that you do some
good<00:03:19.960> welds<00:03:20.290> on<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.740> make<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.980> strong

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
good welds on this and make it strong

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.160 
good welds on this and make it strong
and<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.270> don't<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.570> weak<00:03:22.780> spot<00:03:23.020> in<00:03:23.140> your

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and you don't have a weak spot in your

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.860 
and you don't have a weak spot in your
frame<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.940> gonna<00:03:25.090> break<00:03:25.300> out<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.570> welder

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
frame so I'm gonna break out the welder

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.520 
frame so I'm gonna break out the welder
and<00:03:27.540> start<00:03:28.540> laying<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.810> few<00:03:28.989> beads<00:03:29.140> get<00:03:29.440> the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
and start laying a few beads get the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.000 
and start laying a few beads get the
welder<00:03:29.800> dialed<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.870> then<00:03:31.870> we'll<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.140> ready

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
welder dialed in and then we'll be ready

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.790 
welder dialed in and then we'll be ready
to<00:03:33.250> actually<00:03:33.370> weld<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.850> our<00:03:34.120> C<00:03:34.330> notch<00:03:34.800> alright

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
to actually weld in our C notch alright

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.080 
to actually weld in our C notch alright
as<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.489> thing<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:36.730> kind<00:03:37.030> of

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
as you can see this thing is kind of

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.150 
as you can see this thing is kind of
still<00:03:37.300> smoking<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.810> little<00:03:37.959> bit<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.950> just

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
still smoking a little bit and I just

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.640 
still smoking a little bit and I just
did<00:03:39.310> five<00:03:39.610> little<00:03:40.200> beads<00:03:41.200> right<00:03:41.380> there

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
did five little beads right there

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.580 
did five little beads right there
adjusting<00:03:42.660> really<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.750> wire<00:03:43.930> speed<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
adjusting really the wire speed of the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.540 
adjusting really the wire speed of the
welder

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
welder

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.150 
welder
I<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:46.330> crank<00:03:46.570> up<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> voltage<00:03:47.440> as<00:03:47.800> much<00:03:47.980> as

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
I just crank up the voltage as much as

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.430 
I just crank up the voltage as much as
as<00:03:48.520> much<00:03:48.700> as<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:48.970> would<00:03:49.060> go<00:03:49.140> because<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.260> just

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
as much as it would go because I just

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.910 
as much as it would go because I just
have<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> little<00:03:50.970> 110<00:03:51.970> welder<00:03:52.330> here<00:03:52.739> but<00:03:53.739> just

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
have a little 110 welder here but just

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.620 
have a little 110 welder here but just
playing<00:03:54.100> with<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.370> wire<00:03:54.520> speed<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.450> think

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
playing with the wire speed and I think
