here's the tail section I want to tip it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.170 
here's the tail section I want to tip it
up<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.110> there's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> gear<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.030> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
up because there's a gear in it but this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
up because there's a gear in it but this
is<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.129> bottom<00:00:56.129> half<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.800> there<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:58.890> water

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
is the bottom half and there was water

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
is the bottom half and there was water
in<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.640> since<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.600> an<00:01:00.690> old<00:01:00.840> motor<00:01:01.190> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
in it and since it was an old motor I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.960 
in it and since it was an old motor I
thought<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.940> would<00:01:03.090> take<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.420> apart<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
thought we would take it apart and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.080 
thought we would take it apart and
replace<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.890> seals<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.670> ordered

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
replace the the seals in it so I ordered

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.130 
replace the the seals in it so I ordered
I<00:01:09.299> went<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> marina<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.820> kit<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
I went to a marina got the kit for it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.010 
I went to a marina got the kit for it
and<00:01:14.750> decided<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.960> replace<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.890> seals<00:01:18.020> that's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and decided to replace the seals that's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
and decided to replace the seals that's
when<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> ran<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.950> problem<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.939> here

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
when I ran into a problem this one here

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.980 
when I ran into a problem this one here
is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.020> prop<00:01:25.290> shaft<00:01:25.320> seal<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:27.390> goes<00:01:29.990> right

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
is the prop shaft seal and it goes right

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
is the prop shaft seal and it goes right
here<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:32.579> prop<00:01:32.820> shaft<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:35.670> aluminum

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
here on the prop shaft in this aluminum

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.319 
here on the prop shaft in this aluminum
housing<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.770> my<00:01:37.770> problem<00:01:38.280> was<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.759> trying<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
housing and my problem was was trying to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
housing and my problem was was trying to
remove<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.590> there's<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> hole<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
remove this now there's a hole in it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
remove this now there's a hole in it
because<00:01:41.579> I've<00:01:41.700> already<00:01:41.850> removed<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
because I've already removed it but I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.639 
because I've already removed it but I
searched<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> internet<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:45.380> couldn't<00:01:46.380> find

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
searched on the internet I couldn't find

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.210 
searched on the internet I couldn't find
any<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.540> without<00:01:49.220> damaging

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
any way to get this out without damaging

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
any way to get this out without damaging
the<00:01:50.310> housing<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.790> wanted<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.329> careful

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the housing I wanted to be very careful

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.929 
the housing I wanted to be very careful
so<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> stainless<00:01:52.409> steel<00:01:52.590> seal<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.399> an

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so this is a stainless steel seal in an

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.600 
so this is a stainless steel seal in an
aluminum<00:01:54.210> housing<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.950> there's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
aluminum housing and in the back there's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.380 
aluminum housing and in the back there's
a<00:01:56.700> brass<00:01:57.030> sleeve<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.259> propeller<00:01:58.799> shaft

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
a brass sleeve that the propeller shaft

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.950 
a brass sleeve that the propeller shaft
travels<00:02:00.390> through<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:02.000> it's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.180> delicate<00:02:03.840> piece

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
travels through so it's a delicate piece

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.510 
travels through so it's a delicate piece
of<00:02:04.170> metal<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.799> want<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> handle<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
of metal you don't want to handle it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.399 
of metal you don't want to handle it
roughly<00:02:05.850> because<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> soft<00:02:07.140> aluminum

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
roughly because of the soft aluminum

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.100 
roughly because of the soft aluminum
brass<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.539> seal<00:02:09.959> out

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 

my<00:02:13.440> first<00:02:13.740> solution<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> there's<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.820> video

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
my first solution is a there's a video

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.310 
my first solution is a there's a video
on<00:02:15.450> YouTube<00:02:15.900> showing<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.860> gentleman<00:02:18.320> using

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
on YouTube showing a gentleman using

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.000 
on YouTube showing a gentleman using
this<00:02:19.530> tool<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.520> take<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.420> seal<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.650> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
this tool to take out a seal and it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.710 
this tool to take out a seal and it
worked<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.180> went<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.630> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
worked really well so I went and I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.130 
worked really well so I went and I
bought<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.740> turns<00:02:26.070> out<00:02:26.370> though<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
bought it it turns out though that this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.290 
bought it it turns out though that this
tool<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:29.240> actually<00:02:30.240> too<00:02:30.750> large<00:02:31.080> for<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
tool is actually too large for the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.020 
tool is actually too large for the
chef's<00:02:33.840> these<00:02:34.350> seals<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> can't<00:02:35.610> get<00:02:35.850> this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
chef's these seals so I can't get this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.340 
chef's these seals so I can't get this
tool<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.720> here<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:38.100> hammer<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:40.080> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
tool in here to hammer up on it to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.750 
tool in here to hammer up on it to
remove<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> had<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.490> come<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.700> with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
remove it so I had to come up with

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.020 
remove it so I had to come up with
another<00:02:42.000> solution<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.770> was<00:02:44.010> with<00:02:44.190> my<00:02:44.430> son<00:02:44.490> at

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
another solution so I was with my son at

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.110 
another solution so I was with my son at
the<00:02:45.900> tool<00:02:46.140> store<00:02:46.560> talking<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.640> men<00:02:47.880> who

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the tool store talking to the men who

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.580 
the tool store talking to the men who
owned<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.390> tool<00:02:48.600> store<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.990> see<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:49.260> he<00:02:49.380> had<00:02:49.560> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
owned a tool store to see if he had a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.510 
owned a tool store to see if he had a
smaller<00:02:50.010> version<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.530> tool<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.250> some

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
smaller version of this tool or some

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.230 
smaller version of this tool or some
other<00:02:53.730> solution<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.580> turns<00:02:56.580> out<00:02:56.760> he<00:02:56.880> didn't

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
other solution and turns out he didn't

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.850 
other solution and turns out he didn't
but<00:02:57.480> there<00:02:57.630> was<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> gentleman<00:02:58.230> standing<00:02:58.620> there

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
but there was a gentleman standing there

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.190 
but there was a gentleman standing there
who<00:02:59.040> was<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> customer<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.970> he<00:03:00.630> told<00:03:00.870> me<00:03:01.050> what

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
who was a customer and he told me what

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.980 
who was a customer and he told me what
to<00:03:01.320> do<00:03:01.470> he<00:03:01.740> said<00:03:02.900> drill<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> pilot<00:03:04.050> hole<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:05.010> this

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
to do he said drill a pilot hole in this

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.340 
to do he said drill a pilot hole in this
seal<00:03:08.780> put<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> self-tapping<00:03:10.410> screw<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.130> it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
seal put a self-tapping screw in it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.940 
seal put a self-tapping screw in it
clamp<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.650> pair<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.610> vise<00:03:14.910> grips<00:03:14.940> onto<00:03:15.540> this

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
clamp a pair of vise grips onto this

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.060 
clamp a pair of vise grips onto this
screw<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:18.060> apply<00:03:18.600> pressure<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
screw and then apply pressure on the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.940 
screw and then apply pressure on the
seal<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.150> will<00:03:21.240> come<00:03:21.420> up<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.920> sure<00:03:22.920> enough

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
seal and it will come up and sure enough

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.560 
seal and it will come up and sure enough
to<00:03:23.400> work<00:03:23.640> now<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:23.970> not<00:03:24.240> going<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.450> demonstrate

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
to work now I'm not going to demonstrate

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.150 
to work now I'm not going to demonstrate
it<00:03:24.990> today<00:03:25.200> because<00:03:25.410> I've<00:03:25.530> already<00:03:25.680> got<00:03:25.830> these

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
out but I will show you how to remove

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.690 
out but I will show you how to remove
them<00:03:30.920> okay<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.640> what<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:33.000> have<00:03:33.030> here<00:03:33.270> again<00:03:34.050> is

the<00:03:36.020> prop<00:03:37.020> shaft<00:03:37.050> housing<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.580> seal<00:03:39.420> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the prop shaft housing and the seal that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.180 
the prop shaft housing and the seal that
goes<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.770> one<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.070> took

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
goes in it this is the one that I took

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.400 
goes in it this is the one that I took
out<00:03:41.580> again<00:03:42.240> I'm<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.600> going<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.930> remove<00:03:43.230> this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
out again I'm not going to remove this

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.830 
out again I'm not going to remove this
but<00:03:43.620> I'm<00:03:43.740> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.950> show<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.250> what<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.610> did

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
but I'm going to show you what I did

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.040 
but I'm going to show you what I did
okay<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.020> here's<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.530> seal<00:03:47.570> just<00:03:48.570> installed

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
okay so here's that seal just installed

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.850 
okay so here's that seal just installed
by<00:03:49.260> hand<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:50.280> drill<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.970> hole<00:03:51.960> again<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.680> have

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
by hand you drill a hole again you have

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.450 
by hand you drill a hole again you have
to<00:03:53.010> right<00:03:53.310> behind<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:55.770> brass<00:03:57.320> bearing

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
to right behind this is a brass bearing

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.100 
to right behind this is a brass bearing
that<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.610> prop<00:03:59.820> goes<00:04:00.240> through<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.900> prop

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
that the prop goes through the prop

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.330 
that the prop goes through the prop
shaft<00:04:01.320> goes<00:04:01.620> through<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.250> be

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
shaft goes through so you have to be

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.040 
shaft goes through so you have to be
careful<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.880> don't<00:04:02.910> drill<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.600> too<00:04:03.780> deep

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
careful that you don't drill in too deep

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.360 
careful that you don't drill in too deep
make<00:04:04.320> sure<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.560> don't<00:04:04.710> want<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.890> damage<00:04:05.070> that

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
make sure you don't want to damage that

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.580 
make sure you don't want to damage that
so<00:04:06.360> then<00:04:06.960> I<00:04:06.990> took<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.290> self-tapping<00:04:07.800> screw

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
so then I took a self-tapping screw

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.380 
so then I took a self-tapping screw
screwed<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.740> in<00:04:13.460> like<00:04:14.460> this<00:04:14.760> I'll<00:04:15.210> use<00:04:15.270> a

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
screwed it in like this I'll use a

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.940 
screwed it in like this I'll use a
screwdriver<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.380> hole<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.680> already

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
screwdriver but this hole is already

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.400 
screwdriver but this hole is already
done<00:04:17.160> okay

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
done okay

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.289 
done okay
then<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> took<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.640> put<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.030> on<00:04:21.150> my

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
then I took this and put it in on my

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.040 
then I took this and put it in on my
vise<00:04:21.570> over<00:04:21.930> here<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.970> used<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.090> rag<00:04:24.330> because

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
vise over here I used a rag because

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.120 
vise over here I used a rag because
again<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.710> is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
again this is

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.090 
again this is
aluminum<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:27.060> very<00:04:27.360> soft<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:28.770> have<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.980> be

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
aluminum it's very soft you have to be

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.820 
aluminum it's very soft you have to be
careful<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.960> put<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.290> vise

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
clamped it to the head of the screw and

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.490 
clamped it to the head of the screw and
I<00:04:44.220> used<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.300> then<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.510> simply<00:04:45.810> took<00:04:46.200> a

the body of the vise grips to pull it

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.820 
the body of the vise grips to pull it
out<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:59.700> this<00:04:59.820> case<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.330> used<00:05:03.470> this<00:05:04.470> tool

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
out so in this case I used this tool

out so in this case I used this tool
here<00:05:05.160> as<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:06.150> lever<00:05:06.570> point<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.260> just<00:05:08.780> pulled<00:05:09.780> up

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
here as a lever point and just pulled up

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.260 
here as a lever point and just pulled up
on<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.320> vise<00:05:10.800> grips<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:13.250> seal<00:05:14.250> came<00:05:15.030> out

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
on the vise grips and the seal came out

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.890 
on the vise grips and the seal came out
like<00:05:15.480> that
