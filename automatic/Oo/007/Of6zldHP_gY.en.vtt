00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.299
 Today I'll show you three cool recipes 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 who can make toaster sandwiches 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.740
 and not with boring classics 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740
 are 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.560
 First we make a post as well 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.150
 honey chopped walnuts and cool 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.450
 show and we cut the whole thing 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.740
 of course, must be the first to write 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.810
 not everyone but you can do this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.170
 small shove up there the hat so to 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.300
 cut off and then best 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.690
 still man cut the middle and it is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.690
 Again an alien happy is your family 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.050
 to take in our office 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.400
 if you cut it all ready 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.230
 you can just have your wine 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.670
 chop small and roast in the pan 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 You do not need fat walnuts for that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.790
 are fat enough 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 while the nuts are still in there 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.270
 we can rust ours already 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.470
 put the center cobbler in and the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.470
 first location to unite 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 a little honey 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 our nuts and a bit of salt 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.570
 pepper and of course very important 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.619
 still make the slice toast and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.759
 then with violence 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.820
 and now the snow is coming along 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.399
 Namely brands just looks 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.880
 in between times purely 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:44.229
 and he looks pretty good to me 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 actually wants to eat right now 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.229
 but it is way too hot and i would 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.479
 burn all the garbage and that 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.619
 I say from experience so for 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.330
 all who have not done that yet 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.330
 Believe me the way pure white flowers 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.120
 Delicious really not that 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.120
 boring slices of cheese salad 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.250
 This fund is with tuna capparoni 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.140
 cheese bread cheese and carrie and first 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.460
 Of course we have to bring the cream cheese with us 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.370
 We would like to need about 1 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.000
 close tablespoon of curry months 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.870
 and then we just have to do it all 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.110
 we put that aside for now 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.160
 - our red onion and small series 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.720
 small fine rings 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.250
 if you 're wondering why I am 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.900
 do not start crying and look 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.430
 how marylin manson gets involved 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.750
 have themselves seen our video heck the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.230
 could look here now if it still 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.570
 not read 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.810
 Now we want our funny ones 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.570
 pepperoni top these hang 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.030
 top off and then cut small 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.160
 fine things in my village is now 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.790
 Here's a bit of the cheese edge still 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.410
 tuned 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.540
 if the euro was on I would turn it on 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.390
 cut off every fall now 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.100
 we crow the toast with our curry 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.100
 and then funny beginning to prove 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.800
 Now comes the next do builds 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.070
 now in thuringia and a few of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:22.470
 then a bit more for our loved ones 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:26.180
 since the carpet a little line to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.180
 top but delicious 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.610
 the next course is with everyone 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.140
 he does not do any of his favorite ingredients 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.240
 love still with Sanyo that they must 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.380
 but the cameramen cost me 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.520
 I know that many of you know that 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.290
 That's why I show you that 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.490

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.540
 but few leaves donate first 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.250
 let's take our mozzarella 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.660
 mozzarella could have a lot of water 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.350
 you 're going to get it out now , and so on 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.540
 a little bit early 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.430
 sap place now we can our 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.840
 tomatoes are cutting but as we are right now 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.150
 the pack said they are not 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.490
 tomatoes but close play a bit 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.450
 funny and there we cut now small 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.450
 fine slices 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.659
 with the big tomatoes if we are 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.489
 usually the green stream you 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.530
 cut out as totally unhealthy 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.539
 but with the little that's ok because you can 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.799
 Just hang her tight with her 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.720
 tomatoes are finished, got yours 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.259

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.150
 we still need fine slices 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.919
 four to five sheets of edgar 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.669

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.669
