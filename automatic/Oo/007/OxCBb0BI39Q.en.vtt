00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
solution you realize that it could be

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.990 
solution you realize that it could be
any<00:00:11.020> one<00:00:11.199> of<00:00:11.260> the<00:00:11.379> injectors<00:00:12.010> but<00:00:12.400> have<00:00:12.580> no<00:00:12.789> way

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
any one of the injectors but have no way

any one of the injectors but have no way
of<00:00:13.030> really<00:00:13.330> knowing<00:00:13.480> and<00:00:14.410> of<00:00:14.650> course<00:00:14.920> you

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
of really knowing and of course you

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.040 
of really knowing and of course you
could<00:00:15.400> just<00:00:15.639> replace<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.270> injectors<00:00:16.810> but

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
could just replace the injectors but

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.290 
could just replace the injectors but
wouldn't<00:00:17.679> that<00:00:17.710> be<00:00:17.920> too<00:00:18.099> costly<00:00:18.369> what<00:00:19.089> about

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
wouldn't that be too costly what about

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.210 
wouldn't that be too costly what about
the<00:00:19.449> last<00:00:19.720> time<00:00:20.019> you<00:00:20.140> replaced<00:00:20.500> an<00:00:20.679> injector

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
the last time you replaced an injector

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.759 
the last time you replaced an injector
were<00:00:21.699> you<00:00:21.849> really<00:00:22.119> sure<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.419> was<00:00:22.599> bad<00:00:22.839> what<00:00:23.650> if

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 
were you really sure it was bad what if

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.320 
were you really sure it was bad what if
there<00:00:23.980> was<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.160> way<00:00:24.369> to<00:00:24.400> validate<00:00:25.119> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
there was a way to validate the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.319 
there was a way to validate the
injectors<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:26.050> be<00:00:26.349> 100%<00:00:26.650> sure<00:00:27.609> if<00:00:28.119> they<00:00:28.269> were

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
injectors and be 100% sure if they were

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.040 
injectors and be 100% sure if they were
good<00:00:28.720> or<00:00:28.749> bad<00:00:29.050> without<00:00:29.800> any<00:00:30.070> doubt

in<00:00:50.289> today<00:00:50.559> my<00:00:50.859> check<00:00:51.039> engine<00:00:51.340> light<00:00:51.489> came<00:00:51.670> on

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
in today my check engine light came on

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.819 
in today my check engine light came on
sounds<00:00:52.840> like<00:00:52.929> it<00:00:53.019> could<00:00:53.140> be<00:00:53.170> fuel<00:00:53.440> injection

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
sounds like it could be fuel injection

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.410 
sounds like it could be fuel injection
but<00:00:54.100> scan<00:00:54.399> your<00:00:54.519> car's<00:00:54.699> computer<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.300> see

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
but scan your car's computer and see

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.250 
but scan your car's computer and see
what<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.600> trouble<00:00:55.719> codes<00:00:55.960> are<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.170> then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
what the trouble codes are and then

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:05.770 
what the trouble codes are and then
we'll<00:00:56.320> go<00:00:56.440> from<00:00:56.559> there

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.970 

we're<00:01:06.780> engines<00:01:07.080> definitely<00:01:07.440> got<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> misfire

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
we're engines definitely got a misfire

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.140 
we're engines definitely got a misfire
can<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> leave<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.760> me<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
can you leave it with me for a little

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
while run a few tests sure just let me

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.600 
while run a few tests sure just let me
know<00:01:11.040> when<00:01:11.160> it's<00:01:11.280> done

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610

before going on a test drive the car

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.730 
before going on a test drive the car
runs<00:01:20.820> better<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.870> check<00:01:22.140> engine<00:01:22.170> light

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
runs better but the check engine light

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.540 
runs better but the check engine light
comes<00:01:23.040> back<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:25.410> technician<00:01:26.010> has<00:01:26.160> already

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
comes back on the technician has already

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.430 
comes back on the technician has already
done<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> current<00:01:27.360> ramping<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.930> injector

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
done a current ramping and injector

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.710 
done a current ramping and injector
resistance<00:01:28.979> test<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:30.000> appears<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> be

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
resistance test and all appears to be

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.190 
resistance test and all appears to be
okay

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
okay

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
but the technician still feels that it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.900 
but the technician still feels that it
might<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> injectors<00:01:34.800> he<00:01:35.369> decides<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
might be the injectors he decides to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.060 
might be the injectors he decides to
pull<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> injectors<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.110> perform<00:01:37.740> an<00:01:37.860> off
