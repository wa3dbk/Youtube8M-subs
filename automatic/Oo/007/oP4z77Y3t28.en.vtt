00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.509
 luiz eduardo owns a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.490
 and installed 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.309
 monitoring for the company located 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.170
 on the corner of the streets antônio dos anjos 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 with mall saints 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.539
 in addition to providing them with more security 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.720
 billboards that catch the eye 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 on Saturday around 6 pm 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 in the morning the bus arrived at the corner where 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.929
 there is no stopping place now observe the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.719
 security cameras have captured the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620
 generalized within the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 vehicle 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.079
 in these exclusive images the passengers 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 shine and swap punches 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.539
 including collector eventually 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 involving two people come to fall 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.670
 out of the bus because of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.340
 violence in the images gives to realize 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.180
 still the imbalance of passengers 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.949
 sign of drunkenness and this resident 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 woke up with the noise of the fights 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.329
 Then when I look at the bed window, the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 general beating that general fight 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.689
 And then I got very worried about God. 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 because the assaults do not just happen 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.720
 the collective 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.510
 imagines a generalized fight within 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 no problem for the collector was the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.049
 driver and passengers on people who 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 are there inside that collective 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.909
 according to the bus company was 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.759
 made an incident report on the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.659
 happened according to the report 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.880
 started after drunken people 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.909
 entered the collective the company told 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 that this type of behavior is common to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.640
 mess and vandalism usually happen 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 the driver who made the holy line 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.439
 Terezinha stopped the bus on Rua Antônio 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.549
 of the angels and threatened to call the brigade 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.100
 military 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.250
 there the door was forced and who 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.710
 stars in confusion got off the bus 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.370
 I'm in order 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.370
 the situation has normalized
