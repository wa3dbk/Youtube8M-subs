 Alice I go with the crossbow - engines - a bit of forward with a young man who 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.129
 I am or Paul 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.350
 and today it seems a problem that is perhaps not very well known to most 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 Player machines and especially ream readers I know very well 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.720
 it is called in the jargon input read and I have to climatic regata disperi last 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.170
 generation in what consists consists of the fact that when we have the 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.460
 source connected to the TV 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.210
 the image that comes from the source is displayed by the TV with a 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.400
 certainly delayed 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.010
 that's when we watch a movie on a television program a part of football 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.940
 maybe it doesn't matter but with it I was playing book contains bersani moment

 right well then if the delta is a passer-by bartering weight image - lo 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.660
 screen late then we do death 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.549
 what this input lag is due to the image hornet circuits 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.989
 dividing elements lately televisions in the end always circuits sophisticated 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.409
 command 100 hertz or contrast enhancement or 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.119
 improvement of contours and so on study functions that however require 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.929
 time and this time involves creating this delay between images 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.640
 image input that your mind actually appears and us

 erected 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.880
 certainly and the delay between the pages generated by the step on the computer is that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.380
 that you have displayed on the TV 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.899
 how can you solve this problem in a very simple reality on many 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.439
 on TV 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.789

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.729
 for improvements the image that create this delay p.iva obtained are very 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:22.229
 interesting even a little surprising and the delays vary from the 170 rivers 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:27.459
 seconds suitable for 5 milliseconds and the thing we noticed is that they are 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.369
 just the TV which perhaps the most advanced of the last generation to do is 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.409
