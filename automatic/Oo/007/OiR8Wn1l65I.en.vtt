00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 that was the right thing for the team today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.470
 bitter after a tough fight she has 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.990
 namely against the tabulated vfl 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.730
 Osnabrück lost away and that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 almost in the last second because 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.710
 actually after the 3 to 2 that was 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.240
 play already to the end 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 which hansa player's spiritual 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.529
 assistance of the ladies from the red cross at 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.470
 end of demand is not known 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.640
 At first you play it from Osnabrück 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.189
 on the ground hansa on top that had happened 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 15 minute foul on Zimmermann so it looks 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 the referee and decide 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 Crime and what makes Rostock's coach 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.140
 looks the only one in the wrong 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 Only the bank can cheer 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.160
 about this e melli q1 10 and the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.930
 osnabrücker they do not even know 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 where with the ball hansa attacks earlier 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 no air to breathe 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 for the lilies, that gave the feeling that that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 who were unsure and us that the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.930
 vote was wrong when in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.820
 osnabrück and with us actually 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.850
 hardly danger 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 hansa is simply better 61 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 minutes rostocks left side defended 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 again in the opponent's half 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.040
 Osnabrück with a purple break in the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.720
 defensive and suddenly it is 2 2 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.790
 coach fascist seems stunned what 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.689
 we lead 2 10 0 at table fourth 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
 can this be 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.210
 yes the scoreboard with not osnabrück 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.150
 continue playfully inferior but 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.250
 Angry and Hanser helps happiness 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.500
 then the crucial scene of the game 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.410
 at osnabrück sebastian neumann goes from 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 place and it comes to emil jula ten 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.560
 minutes later the fresh julia endeavors 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.560
 his crest 2 to 1 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.140
 and then he's cracked again 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 thread at hansa just two minutes later 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 have been the twelve meter 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.350
 Well 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.540
 season thanks and the drama shows 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.480
 on the blackboard 2 to 2 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.069
 the there's not quietly 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.430
 play quietly there is still going on 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.140
 What 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.810
 that seems to paint marc fascher 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.140
 actually 90 minutes clear case 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.060
 free kicks and he could haas the oster 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.560
 but Leonard Haas plays for Hansa 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.140
 forgive that is it or 93 minute 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.120
 last attack osnabrück and then that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.790
 again over left again jula double pack 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.620
 three to two for building on the gate 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.209
 falls into the final whistle and 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.200
 counts a blue eye 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.690
 very bitter the disappointment is very 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.540
 very large we demand 2002 led 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.739
 it would have a three point Easter 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.450
 for a brain researcher 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.510
 instead, continue to descend 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:07.600
 for a team that pulled out the big one 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.600
 afraid to learn if you can
