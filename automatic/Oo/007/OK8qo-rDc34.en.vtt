00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
believe when you cross the little Ben
Sawyer<00:00:38.820> bridge<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.469> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Sawyer bridge and you get that that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
Sawyer bridge and you get that that
sense<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.309> place<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.059> sense<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
sense of place in that sense of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
sense of place in that sense of
community<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> you're<00:00:44.309> home

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
community and you know that you're home

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
community and you know that you're home
it's<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> destination<00:00:46.710> it's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
it's not it's not a destination it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.459 
it's not it's not a destination it's
just<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.520> feeling<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.840> home<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
just a feeling that that's your home and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.380 
just a feeling that that's your home and
I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> small<00:00:51.210> town

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
I think just that this is a small town

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
I think just that this is a small town
environment<00:00:51.570> has<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> lot<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
environment has a lot to do with that I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
environment has a lot to do with that I
think<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.750> someone's<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.289> experience<00:00:55.890> for

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
think that someone's on experience for

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
think that someone's on experience for
for<00:00:56.579> residents<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.390> tall<00:00:57.600> stone<00:00:57.840> ian's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
for residents and for tall stone ian's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
for residents and for tall stone ian's
who<00:00:58.260> historically<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.829> had<00:00:58.980> beach<00:00:59.430> houses

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
who historically have had beach houses

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.299 
who historically have had beach houses
out<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.739> experience<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
out here I think that experience is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.219 
out here I think that experience is
coming<00:01:02.489> over<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> summer<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.629> joined

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
coming over for the summer and joined

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
coming over for the summer and joined
the<00:01:04.379> beach<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.369> fishing<00:01:05.820> crabbing

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the beach and going fishing crabbing

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.890 
the beach and going fishing crabbing
I<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.220> Evelynn<00:01:08.840> lent<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
I think all those of Evelynn lent to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.010 
I think all those of Evelynn lent to
that<00:01:10.140> over<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> years<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.479> been<00:01:12.720> able<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that over the years we have been able to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
that over the years we have been able to
maintain<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.560> small-town<00:01:14.010> character

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
maintain that small-town character

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
maintain that small-town character
Sullivan's<00:01:15.119> Island<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> number<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.830> ways<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
Sullivan's Island in a number of ways I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740 
Sullivan's Island in a number of ways I
think<00:01:17.340> first<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> foremost<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> people

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
think first and foremost of the people

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
think first and foremost of the people
the<00:01:18.900> residents<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> island<00:01:19.560> wanted<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the residents of the island wanted to be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.120 
the residents of the island wanted to be
that<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.530> incorporated

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that way and so we have incorporated

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
that way and so we have incorporated
some<00:01:23.280> very<00:01:23.490> good<00:01:23.580> zoning<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
some very good zoning for one thing that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
some very good zoning for one thing that
has<00:01:25.530> kept<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> development

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
has kept out some of the development

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.280 
has kept out some of the development
that<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.600> other<00:01:27.750> neighboring

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that you see in other neighboring

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.520 
that you see in other neighboring
communities<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.900> folks<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.380> as

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
communities and folks that was as

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.550 
communities and folks that was as
close-knit<00:01:31.799> community<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.549> people<00:01:32.670> respond

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
close-knit community and people respond

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.719 
close-knit community and people respond
when<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:34.829> issue<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.280> always<00:01:35.520> know

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
when there's an issue we always know

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
when there's an issue we always know
about<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.750> hear<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:36.990> town

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
about it then we hear about town

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
about it then we hear about town
meetings<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.869> has<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> lot

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
meetings and I think that that has a lot

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.249 
meetings and I think that that has a lot
to<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
to do with it

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.350 
to do with it
I<00:01:41.290> believe<00:01:42.280> something's<00:01:42.640> on<00:01:42.759> future<00:01:43.210> is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
I believe something's on future is

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.390 
I believe something's on future is
bright<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.590> think<00:01:44.650> that<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.220> community

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
bright I think that the community

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.649 
bright I think that the community
continues<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.750> support<00:01:47.520> strong<00:01:48.659> residential
