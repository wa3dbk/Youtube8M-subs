 block this file in the system 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.810
 operative is your iphone which is going to 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.810

 here they are going to upload that file here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.010
 if it's not going to start charging it's going to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.590
 say preparing the iphone there leaves it 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.490
 until I finish until I finish everything 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.170
 then you go to the iphone you stay 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.890
 well and will you say that you have the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.180
 version 3.1 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.150
 a 13.1 it seems but in reality you 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.310
 they already have six is ​​six here and 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.760
 there is a way to detect that there is a 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.850
 new update, do not go for nothing 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.860

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 shit in the milk pot 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.110
 because they do not have to update it 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.120

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.500

 because they already have it to 6.0 also 6.0 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.180
 is what this thing is doing 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.430
 to the iphone he says he has the 3 but in 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.590
