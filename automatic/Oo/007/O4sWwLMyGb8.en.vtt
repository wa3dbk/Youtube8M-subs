which we talked about earlier the main
differences<00:00:21.340> are<00:00:21.550> instead<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:21.970> hot<00:00:22.240> cues<00:00:22.570> it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
differences are instead of hot cues it

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.540 
differences are instead of hot cues it
has<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.109> auto<00:00:23.470> beat<00:00:23.710> loops<00:00:23.920> over<00:00:24.250> here<00:00:24.400> let<00:00:24.519> me

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
has the auto beat loops over here let me

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.419 
has the auto beat loops over here let me
show<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:24.849> how<00:00:24.910> those<00:00:25.060> work<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:26.919> press<00:00:27.189> the

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
show you how those work if you press the

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.480 
show you how those work if you press the
8<00:00:27.939> button<00:00:28.390> here<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.859> gives<00:00:30.009> you<00:00:30.189> a<00:00:30.249> perfect

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
8 button here and it gives you a perfect

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.090 
8 button here and it gives you a perfect
eight<00:00:31.300> beat<00:00:31.749> loop<00:00:32.050> regardless<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.829> when<00:00:32.980> you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
eight beat loop regardless of when you

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
eight beat loop regardless of when you
press<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.489> button

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.660 

so<00:00:37.840> once<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.320> loop<00:00:38.469> is<00:00:38.649> set<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:38.920> can<00:00:39.100> now<00:00:39.370> cut<00:00:39.640> it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
so once the loop is set I can now cut it

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.139 
so once the loop is set I can now cut it
in<00:00:39.850> half<00:00:40.110> turn<00:00:41.110> into<00:00:41.379> a<00:00:41.410> four<00:00:41.680> beat<00:00:41.860> loop<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
in half turn into a four beat loop to

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.290 
in half turn into a four beat loop to
beat<00:00:43.360> loop<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.920> beat<00:00:45.129> loop<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.579> so<00:00:45.789> forth<00:00:46.120> and

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
beat loop one beat loop and so forth and

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.639 
beat loop one beat loop and so forth and
right<00:00:46.719> here<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.020> our<00:00:47.140> exit<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:49.440> cool<00:00:50.440> feature

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
right here is our exit a cool feature

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.830 
right here is our exit a cool feature
that<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.160> 900<00:00:51.879> has<00:00:52.030> that<00:00:52.269> you<00:00:52.359> actually<00:00:52.690> don't

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
that the 900 has that you actually don't

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.500 
that the 900 has that you actually don't
find<00:00:53.109> on<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.379> 2000<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.280> slip<00:00:54.640> mode

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
find on the 2000 is slip mode

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.299 
find on the 2000 is slip mode
this<00:00:56.140> makes<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.559> scratching<00:00:57.039> a<00:00:57.100> little

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
this makes the scratching a little

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.540 
this makes the scratching a little
easier<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:57.850> normally<00:00:58.149> want<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.390> scratch

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
easier so you normally want a scratch

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.709 
easier so you normally want a scratch
right<00:01:00.550> now<00:01:00.730> I'm<00:01:00.850> scratching<00:01:01.300> at<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.539> minute

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
right now I'm scratching at one minute

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.530 
right now I'm scratching at one minute
four<00:01:02.019> seconds<00:01:02.559> once<00:01:03.399> I'm<00:01:03.579> done<00:01:03.609> scratching<00:01:04.360> it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
four seconds once I'm done scratching it

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.240 
four seconds once I'm done scratching it
continues<00:01:05.140> playing<00:01:05.439> at<00:01:05.619> one<00:01:05.799> minute<00:01:05.950> four

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
continues playing at one minute four

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.640 
continues playing at one minute four
seconds<00:01:06.700> if<00:01:07.299> I<00:01:07.479> turn<00:01:07.659> slip<00:01:08.049> mode<00:01:08.259> on<00:01:08.439> however

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
seconds if I turn slip mode on however

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.460 
seconds if I turn slip mode on however
the<00:01:09.310> track<00:01:09.729> continues<00:01:10.270> playing<00:01:10.810> as<00:01:11.140> I'm

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
the track continues playing as I'm

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.530 
the track continues playing as I'm
scratching<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.400> now<00:01:12.580> I'm<00:01:12.790> scratching<00:01:13.390> at<00:01:13.509> a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
scratching so now I'm scratching at a

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.770 
scratching so now I'm scratching at a
minute<00:01:13.900> 13<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.890> when<00:01:15.009> I<00:01:15.040> let<00:01:15.250> go<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.780> continues

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
minute 13 and when I let go it continues

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.390 
minute 13 and when I let go it continues
playing<00:01:17.049> in<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.229> minute<00:01:17.470> 16<00:01:17.890> because<00:01:18.159> I<00:01:18.189> just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
playing in a minute 16 because I just

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.880 
playing in a minute 16 because I just
scratch<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.970> 30<00:01:19.270> seconds<00:01:19.780> what<00:01:20.439> that<00:01:20.619> allows

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
scratch for 30 seconds what that allows

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.039 
scratch for 30 seconds what that allows
me<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.189> do<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.549> scratch<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.570> keep<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.840> group

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
me to do is scratch and keep the group

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.120 
me to do is scratch and keep the group
going

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

so<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.400> really<00:01:30.520> cold<00:01:30.820> future

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
so this is a really cold future

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.970 
so this is a really cold future
particularly<00:01:31.510> for<00:01:31.810> novices<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.590> know<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.770> mean

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
particularly for novices you know I mean

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.530 
particularly for novices you know I mean
typically<00:01:33.460> when<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.760> scratch<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.270> got<00:01:34.300> your

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
typically when you scratch you got your

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.970 
typically when you scratch you got your
music<00:01:34.600> playing<00:01:35.050> on<00:01:35.200> one<00:01:35.320> player<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.860> you're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
music playing on one player and you're

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.920 
music playing on one player and you're
scratching<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.640> other<00:01:36.820> with<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.690> slip

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
scratching on the other with the slip

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.900 
scratching on the other with the slip
mode<00:01:38.110> on<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.620> can<00:01:38.740> see<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.010> do<00:01:39.190> scratching<00:01:39.820> on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
mode on you can see you do scratching on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.360 
mode on you can see you do scratching on
the<00:01:40.000> same<00:01:40.210> player<00:01:40.510> as<00:01:41.290> where<00:01:41.620> your<00:01:41.890> primary

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
the same player as where your primary

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.880 
the same player as where your primary
music<00:01:42.790> is<00:01:43.420> playing<00:01:43.840> without<00:01:44.410> losing<00:01:44.800> the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
music is playing without losing the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.850 
music is playing without losing the
groove

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.219 

another<00:01:48.370> minor<00:01:48.640> difference<00:01:49.060> between<00:01:49.360> mm<00:01:50.140> and

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
another minor difference between mm and

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.740 
another minor difference between mm and
900<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.010> right<00:01:51.520> here<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.880> vinyl<00:01:52.180> speed<00:01:52.390> adjust

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
900 is right here the vinyl speed adjust

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.080 
900 is right here the vinyl speed adjust
on<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:52.990> mm<00:01:53.710> just<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.250> 1000<00:01:54.910> you<00:01:54.970> have

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
on the mm just like on the 1000 you have

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.140 
on the mm just like on the 1000 you have
two<00:01:55.300> controls<00:01:55.810> verse<00:01:56.440> on<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.800> 900<00:01:57.370> you<00:01:58.000> have

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
two controls verse on the 900 you have

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.200 
two controls verse on the 900 you have
one<00:01:58.390> control<00:01:59.130> but<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.250> terms<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.610> processing

one control but in terms of processing

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.900 
one control but in terms of processing
power<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:02.080> 900<00:02:02.650> can<00:02:02.800> handle<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.310> same<00:02:03.550> size

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
power the 900 can handle the same size

external hard drive as the 2000 so you

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.359
