00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
your seam on the outside it's the same

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
your seam on the outside it's the same
fabric<00:01:47.909> inside<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
fabric inside and out and then put that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.990 
fabric inside and out and then put that
here<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.009> I'll<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.640> put

here so let's put it on so I'll just put

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
here so let's put it on so I'll just put
it<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
think these are great for longer hair

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.109 
think these are great for longer hair
because<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.020> allows<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.649> allows<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.610> hair
