producing<00:01:32.820> sound<00:01:33.090> from<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.690> drivers<00:01:39.320> but

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
producing sound from these drivers but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
producing sound from these drivers but
realistically<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.940> not<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.900> drivers

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
realistically it's not just the drivers

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
realistically it's not just the drivers
but<00:01:43.530> from<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.310> gigantic<00:01:44.940> cabinet<00:01:45.450> also

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
but from this gigantic cabinet also

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
but from this gigantic cabinet also
producing<00:01:46.350> sound<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:54.680> then<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.830> say<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
producing sound right then we say it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.029 
producing sound right then we say it
will<00:01:56.970> keep<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:59.000> in<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> job<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.380> sound

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
will keep it in the job so the sound

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.920 
will keep it in the job so the sound
coming<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:05.940> from<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.539> cabinet

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
coming out of from from the cabinet

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.820 
coming out of from from the cabinet
surface<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.740> very<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.520> subtle<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:10.110> it's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
surface it is very very subtle but it's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.420 
surface it is very very subtle but it's
surely<00:02:11.670> influencing<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.930> total<00:02:13.680> health<00:02:14.190> of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
surely influencing the total health of

so<00:04:21.579> for<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.150> woodworking<00:04:22.860> machines<00:04:23.860> that's

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
so for the woodworking machines that's

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.820 
so for the woodworking machines that's
going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.180> have<00:04:25.360> make<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.960> grooves<00:04:26.229> and<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:26.710> on

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
going to have make the grooves and so on

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.540 
going to have make the grooves and so on
is<00:04:27.009> not<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.300> precise<00:04:28.810> cool<00:04:29.250> compared<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
is not that precise cool compared to the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.310 
is not that precise cool compared to the
other<00:04:30.840> like<00:04:31.840> metal<00:04:32.229> or<00:04:32.410> plastic<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.960> make

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
other like metal or plastic I so to make

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.580 
other like metal or plastic I so to make
that<00:04:35.530> as<00:04:35.710> accurate<00:04:36.310> as<00:04:36.430> possible<00:04:36.990> there<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.259> a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
that as accurate as possible there is a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.450 
that as accurate as possible there is a
hand<00:04:40.259> curve<00:04:41.550> actually<00:04:42.750> managed<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.830> eat

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
hand curve actually managed so is eat

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.520 
hand curve actually managed so is eat
are<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.970> saying<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.330> all<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:47.050> wood<00:04:47.259> is

the middle yeah almost like a double

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.059 
the middle yeah almost like a double
pane<00:06:26.819> window<00:06:27.209> like<00:06:27.449> this<00:06:27.479> so<00:06:28.169> when<00:06:28.559> the<00:06:28.680> loofa

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
pane window like this so when the loofa

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.999 
pane window like this so when the loofa
moves<00:06:29.639> like<00:06:29.969> this<00:06:30.149> mm-hmm<00:06:30.779> also<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:31.830> air

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
moves like this mm-hmm also the air

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.059 
moves like this mm-hmm also the air
behind<00:06:32.339> this<00:06:32.819> entire<00:06:33.749> cabinet<00:06:34.289> will<00:06:34.589> move<00:06:34.830> and

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
behind this entire cabinet will move and

it's going to hit this boat thing about
and<00:06:38.449> it<00:06:39.449> is<00:06:40.490> vibrating<00:06:41.490> so<00:06:41.909> to<00:06:42.479> have<00:06:42.749> that

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:42.809 
and it is vibrating so to have that

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:45.499 
and it is vibrating so to have that
influence<00:06:43.439> as<00:06:43.769> less<00:06:44.039> as<00:06:44.069> possible<00:06:44.309> he<00:06:45.300> made
