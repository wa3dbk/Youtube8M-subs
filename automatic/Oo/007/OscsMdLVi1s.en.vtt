00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
nice work on the jig drinking jig if you

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.710 
nice work on the jig drinking jig if you
see<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.890> by<00:00:33.070> our<00:00:33.190> picture<00:00:33.550> so<00:00:33.790> nice<00:00:34.510> and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
there they're not crashing around there

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.560 
there they're not crashing around there
basically<00:00:38.710> I'll<00:00:38.830> turn<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.250> pump<00:00:40.030> off<00:00:40.180> we<00:00:40.360> can

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
basically I'll turn the pump off we can

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.200 
basically I'll turn the pump off we can
see<00:00:40.600> better<00:00:40.900> you<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:42.460> this<00:00:42.610> device<00:00:42.970> right

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
see better you see this device right

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.479 
see better you see this device right
here<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.750> actually<00:00:44.110> putting<00:00:44.590> oxygen<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.370> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
here is actually putting oxygen in the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.030 
here is actually putting oxygen in the
water<00:00:45.699> so<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.540> have<00:00:46.809> an<00:00:46.960> oxygenator<00:00:47.620> on<00:00:47.830> both

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
water so I have an oxygenator on both

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.189 
water so I have an oxygenator on both
sides<00:00:48.309> of<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.550> live<00:00:48.729> well<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.629> what<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:49.900> do<00:00:50.019> is

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
sides of the live well and what we do is

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.979 
sides of the live well and what we do is
in<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.620> morning<00:00:50.920> when<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.129> water<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.460> cool<00:00:51.989> we

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
in the morning when the water is cool we

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.380 
in the morning when the water is cool we
actually<00:00:53.409> fill<00:00:53.680> up<00:00:53.800> our<00:00:53.920> live<00:00:54.129> wells<00:00:54.430> we<00:00:55.150> turn

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
actually fill up our live wells we turn

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.140 
actually fill up our live wells we turn
it<00:00:55.540> to<00:00:55.570> recirculation<00:00:56.339> we<00:00:57.339> drop<00:00:57.610> in<00:00:57.820> some<00:00:58.030> of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
it to recirculation we drop in some of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.630 
it to recirculation we drop in some of
this<00:00:58.239> you<00:00:58.510> -<00:00:58.780> okay<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.100> basically<00:01:00.519> is

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
this you - okay and this basically is

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.090 
this you - okay and this basically is

Guardian<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:07.240> relatively<00:01:07.690> new<00:01:07.810> on<00:01:07.930> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
Guardian it's relatively new on the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.410 
Guardian it's relatively new on the

market and I've got that reservoir full
of<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.780> too<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.400> at<00:01:12.520> any<00:01:12.670> given<00:01:12.760> time<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.600> can

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
you watch right up there I hit this pump

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.060 
you watch right up there I hit this pump
this<00:01:18.490> switch<00:01:19.020> boom<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.200> just<00:01:20.410> dropped<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.830> shot

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
this switch boom I just dropped a shot

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.030 
this switch boom I just dropped a shot
of<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.370> two<00:01:21.580> in<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.850> water<00:01:22.560> via<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.800> fish

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
of you two in the water via that fish

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.500 
of you two in the water via that fish
Guardian<00:01:24.430> look<00:01:24.550> how<00:01:24.670> them<00:01:24.820> fish<00:01:25.000> just<00:01:25.240> sitting

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
Guardian look how them fish just sitting

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.020 
Guardian look how them fish just sitting
there<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:25.840> calm<00:01:26.170> as<00:01:26.530> can<00:01:26.710> be<00:01:26.890> because<00:01:27.820> there's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
there so calm as can be because there's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.820 
there so calm as can be because there's
the<00:01:28.150> right<00:01:28.300> amount<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.660> oxygen<00:01:28.990> in<00:01:29.200> there

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
the right amount of oxygen in there

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.590 
the right amount of oxygen in there
they're<00:01:29.980> not<00:01:30.010> starved<00:01:30.580> for<00:01:30.700> oxygen<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.390> each

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
they're not starved for oxygen so each

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.840 
they're not starved for oxygen so each
side<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.960> those<00:01:32.080> live<00:01:32.320> wells<00:01:32.590> are<00:01:33.310> building<00:01:33.760> up

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
side of those live wells are building up

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.990 
side of those live wells are building up
oxygen<00:01:34.120> I<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.770> keep<00:01:35.980> my<00:01:36.130> pump<00:01:36.430> on<00:01:36.580> research

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
oxygen I just keep my pump on research

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.520 
oxygen I just keep my pump on research
so<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.270> water<00:01:37.480> is<00:01:37.660> moving<00:01:37.840> building<00:01:38.440> up

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
so the water is moving building up

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.590 
so the water is moving building up
oxygen<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.220> they<00:01:39.670> said<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.000> their<00:01:40.090> calmest

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
oxygen and they said in their calmest

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 
oxygen and they said in their calmest
can<00:01:40.780> be<00:01:40.930> hot<00:01:41.620> day<00:01:41.830> like<00:01:42.040> today<00:01:42.190> 95<00:01:42.820> degrees

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
can be hot day like today 95 degrees

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.360 
can be hot day like today 95 degrees
no-win<00:01:43.720> both<00:01:44.410> fish<00:01:44.620> can<00:01:44.830> stay<00:01:45.010> in<00:01:45.160> there<00:01:45.340> all

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
no-win both fish can stay in there all

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.250 
no-win both fish can stay in there all
