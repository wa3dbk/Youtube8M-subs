I<00:01:03.610> guess<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.659> be<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> big<00:01:04.989> deal<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.470> source<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
I guess to be a big deal the source and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.370 
I guess to be a big deal the source and
age<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.340> has<00:01:06.850> had<00:01:07.060> pretty<00:01:07.240> good<00:01:07.450> value<00:01:07.659> most<00:01:08.170> of

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
age is has had pretty good value most of

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.840 
age is has had pretty good value most of
our<00:01:08.500> customers<00:01:09.750> take<00:01:10.750> part<00:01:11.049> in<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.850> the
