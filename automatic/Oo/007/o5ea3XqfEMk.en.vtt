00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello to all here nikolov we end up 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 in a new video in which I 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 show you how to film what is 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.130
 pass on your iphone ipod screen or 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.470
 ipad in real time actually to do 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 either videos tutorials 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.050
 that's it, we do it thanks to display 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000
 'record' hours so it's this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.170
 application 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 me if I go in he writes stop 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.609
 the recording because I'm in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 just make this video 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.030
 so I'm going to show you in a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.280
 first time the settings and in a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 second time how to install it then 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 I have to be I break I am 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 under ios 1.1.1 and I have an ipad 2 so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.539
 so in the settings we go in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.579
 settings already i'm going to show a little 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.559
 all we can do 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.899
 then display 'record' hours 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 so the brothers wright that you touch 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.180
 not so rotation 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 I have put native orientation screws 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.880
 so gg nothing changed video format for 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.619
 who and for me to add my voice I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.729
 put with micro audio because before 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.409
 it was in h point 264 slash is bad 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 so I put the buses with audiomicro 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.479
 so video quality I put high to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 catches open gl I do not know at all 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.799
 so it's older gg it's like that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 so he remained active and levels of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.420
 gray I do not know what these scales I 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 do not know what it is no longer then 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 displayed the step step what is that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.649
 it's the taps it's going to be the little point 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.079
 this is the point that shows you 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.270
 where I put my fingers on my screen 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.880
 gold it is useful to make tutorials all 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.340
 that's so I'll leave it for the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 end of the video 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.149
 the size then you have their little 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.420
 you can have a little one like that the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.560
 medium size and wide so wide 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 he is really tall so I want 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.209
 let 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.989
 the average size then web server 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.650
 it's to put the video that you 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.090
 save on a website then the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.340
 activation method we go back all 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.739
 immediately after and the youtube account 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.890
 so I got my youtube account 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.380
 for a plot ad directly the video on 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.360
 my youtube account so I 'll do that 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.870
 after then activation method 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.209
 there is a lot of activation method 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.760
 to start actually filming then 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.849
 good you have spread the icons on the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.690
 springboard with both fingers all that 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.220
 so I put two pressed on 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.900
 the standby button 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.220
 so he's here I 'm here a 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.790
 quickly captures twice on the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.650
 standby button I find the button of 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.200
 standby pressed twice there is no 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.380
 other commands that serves that so 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.860
 that's what I did here so 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.070
 now I show you how we 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.890
 we download display 'record' hours 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.640
 so when you download of course 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.580
 it's on cydia 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.120
 you have display 'record' hours as well 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.790
 that active wrongly wrongly active that's it 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.460
 that's what will allow us to 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.730
 choose the commands to do for 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.760
 just launch the video so we 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.840
 will play on cydia 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.330
 we are waiting for everything to load properly 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.580
 so do not hesitate subscribe to 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.030
 little green thumbs if if you like the 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.520
 video is always a pleasure 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.890
 so that's it then I've already done a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.670
 video about hysteria cordeur there is no 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.040
 bad time now 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.260
 but as in the options and some 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.730
 little things that we changed and who 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.760
 had no voice I wanted to redo a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.930
 little tutoring just a little bit 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.170
 better still so then we wait 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.320
 their data loading 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.299
 then we will go to the source 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.040
 that's the source and that's the source 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.070
 iphone tweak then I show you 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.150
 how is it written to be wrong then 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.959
 iphone tweak so an uncle is changed 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:24.630
 and top left added 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.950
 that's it then it's cydia it's there 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.530
 point 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:40.419
 iphone tweak dot fr then ip hon 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:42.520
 can y w when when then point fr so 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.070
 and the little slash at the end do not 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.169
 forget the slash if ever when you 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.780
 put the slash it works not tried in 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 removing it the last slash I'm talking about 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.680
 last smash after the fr then you 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.940
 add the source so I 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.870
 not go there added because I'm going 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.630
 already there will be a little message 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.650
 and so you do added anyway 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:07.020
 So here we go to the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.560
 source iphone tweak in the die and we 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.060
 looking for 'record' hours display then 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.360
 I advise you to display 'record' 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.580
 fixed hour ios 5 and 10 perry cordeur 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.570
 normal oh I advise you to 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.690
 take the display 'record' hours 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.520
 normal so here you click on it 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.880
 me here at the top right who writes 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.530
 modified but you will be writing 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.780
 installed so you install it and that's it 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.620
 so it will be on your world account and 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.930
 here I find it quite fluid and more 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.540
 it's fluid and it works very well for 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.470
 to make small video games 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.500
 gameplay etc 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.840
 here it was nikolov for a video 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.870
 how to install 10 perry stringer on 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.050
