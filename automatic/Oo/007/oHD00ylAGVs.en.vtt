00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.160 
first and then allow it to dry and then
you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.950> paint<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> underneath<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.910> shoe

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
you can paint the underneath of the shoe

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.620 
you can paint the underneath of the shoe
allow<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> dry<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.150> repeat<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
allow to dry and then you repeat the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.030 
allow to dry and then you repeat the
process<00:02:33.840> until<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:36.300> shoe<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.690> fully<00:02:36.989> covered

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.820 

so<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.069> can<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:41.430> I'm<00:02:41.550> working<00:02:41.700> quickly<00:02:42.830> in

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
so you can see I'm working quickly in

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.800 
so you can see I'm working quickly in
short<00:02:44.250> strokes<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> then<00:02:45.060> longer<00:02:45.450> strokes

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
short strokes and then longer strokes

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.210 
short strokes and then longer strokes
just<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.290> smooth<00:02:46.860> any<00:02:47.310> build-up<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:49.220> again

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
just to smooth any build-up and again

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.059 
just to smooth any build-up and again
you<00:02:50.430> want<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.910> applied<00:02:51.239> nice<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.080> light

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
you want it to be applied nice and light

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.890 
you want it to be applied nice and light
because<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.030> haven't<00:02:54.209> really<00:02:54.510> thick<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
because if you haven't really thick it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.280 
because if you haven't really thick it
will<00:02:55.050> crack<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.209> will<00:02:57.209> also<00:02:57.480> make<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> dancer

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
will crack and will also make the dancer

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.110 
will crack and will also make the dancer
feel<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> bit<00:02:58.830> uncomfortable<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.610> shoe<00:02:59.819> if

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
feel a bit uncomfortable in the shoe if

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.590 
feel a bit uncomfortable in the shoe if
it's<00:03:00.450> bulky<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.940> continue<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.510> process

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
it's bulky so you continue this process

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.220 
it's bulky so you continue this process
all<00:03:07.319> around<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.250> back<00:03:08.510> what<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.630> don't<00:03:09.870> count

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
all around the back what you don't count

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.039 
all around the back what you don't count
is<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.310> elastic<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.060> buy<00:03:12.299> new<00:03:12.570> elastics

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
is the elastic you can buy new elastics

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.390 
is the elastic you can buy new elastics

from your dance shop which will have a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
tutorial on later and how to attach to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.759 
tutorial on later and how to attach to
the<00:03:17.070> shoe<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.940> don't<00:03:18.269> apply<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.320> casing

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
the shoe you don't apply to the casing

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.310 
the shoe you don't apply to the casing
you<00:03:20.430> don't<00:03:20.700> apply<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.360> suede<00:03:21.720> bottom<00:03:22.200> of

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
you don't apply to the suede bottom of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.480 
you don't apply to the suede bottom of
the<00:03:22.380> shoe<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.829> anywhere<00:03:23.519> else<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.329> fine

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:39.650 

so<00:03:31.030> good<00:03:31.690> luck

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
