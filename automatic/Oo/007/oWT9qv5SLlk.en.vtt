00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
I'm ha yeah which is like the goose of

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.580 
I'm ha yeah which is like the goose of
the<00:05:42.349> new<00:05:42.530> gusu<00:05:42.949> ha<00:05:43.280> in<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:44.360> Ethiopian<00:05:45.169> it's

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
the new gusu ha in the Ethiopian it's

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.409 
the new gusu ha in the Ethiopian it's
not<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.979> other<00:05:46.190> hop<00:05:46.490> could<00:05:46.760> is<00:05:46.849> like<00:05:47.060> three

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
not the other hop could is like three

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.140 
not the other hop could is like three
cars<00:05:47.750> in<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.199> epi<00:05:48.560> for<00:05:48.860> good<00:05:49.010> is<00:05:49.220> just<00:05:49.970> like

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
cars in the epi for good is just like

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.189 
cars in the epi for good is just like
they<00:05:50.360> are<00:05:50.479> least<00:05:50.720> two<00:05:51.260> hot<00:05:51.530> in<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:53.419> in<00:05:53.659> the<00:05:53.870> he

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
they are least two hot in the in the he

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.700 
they are least two hot in the in the he
breaks<00:05:54.680> so<00:05:55.430> we<00:05:55.580> see<00:05:55.760> a<00:05:56.080> link<00:05:57.080> between<00:05:57.320> this

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
breaks so we see a link between this

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.080 
breaks so we see a link between this
right<00:05:58.010> here<00:05:58.220> and<00:05:58.370> we<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:58.669> want<00:05:58.820> to<00:05:58.909> share

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
right here and we just want to share

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.669 
right here and we just want to share
