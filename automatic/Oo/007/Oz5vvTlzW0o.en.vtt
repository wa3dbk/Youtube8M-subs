into<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.470> series<00:02:12.120> but<00:02:13.120> frankly<00:02:13.810> I'm<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:14.260> a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
into the series but frankly I'm not a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.980 
into the series but frankly I'm not a
huge<00:02:15.040> fan<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.520> halo<00:02:15.670> even<00:02:16.360> even<00:02:16.870> though

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
huge fan of the halo even even though

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.530 
huge fan of the halo even even though
it's<00:02:17.170> made<00:02:17.350> by<00:02:17.530> grungy<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.850> greatest<00:02:19.180> guys<00:02:19.360> of

it's made by grungy the greatest guys of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.800 
it's made by grungy the greatest guys of
all<00:02:19.630> time<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:21.640> too<00:02:21.910> slow<00:02:22.150> paced<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.690> me<00:02:22.780> I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
all time it's too slow paced for me I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.080 
all time it's too slow paced for me I
think<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.580> kind<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.640> agree<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
think I kind of agree with the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.120 
think I kind of agree with the
philosophy<00:02:25.660> or<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.680> know<00:02:26.830> what<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.100> call

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130

it philosophy or view or whatever that
first<00:02:30.670> person<00:02:30.970> shooters<00:02:31.270> should<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.569> bit

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
first person shooters should be a bit

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.190 
first person shooters should be a bit
more<00:02:31.959> fast-paced<00:02:32.590> rather<00:02:33.250> than<00:02:33.550> how<00:02:34.420> slow<00:02:34.930> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
more fast-paced rather than how slow and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.990 
more fast-paced rather than how slow and
how<00:02:35.319> long<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.980> takes<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.280> kill<00:02:36.489> someone<00:02:36.880> in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
how long it takes to kill someone in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.900 
how long it takes to kill someone in
Halo<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:38.470> kind<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.920> annoys<00:02:39.130> me<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.850> I

going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.280> be<00:02:51.340> made<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.450> be

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
going to be made it's going to be

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.479 
going to be made it's going to be
disappointment<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.290> people<00:02:53.620> because<00:02:53.920> someone

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
disappointment to people because someone

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.770 
disappointment to people because someone
else<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.760> making<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.239> therefore<00:02:55.450> they're

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
else is making it therefore they're

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.210 
else is making it therefore they're
definitely<00:02:56.110> going<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.440> have<00:02:56.500> different<00:02:56.769> ideas

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
definitely going to have different ideas

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.880 
definitely going to have different ideas
and<00:02:57.310> what<00:02:57.700> Bungie<00:02:57.940> would<00:02:58.269> think<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and what Bungie would think and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.590 
and what Bungie would think and
therefore<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.730> not<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.239> be<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.450> game

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
therefore it's not going to be the game

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.300 
therefore it's not going to be the game
that<00:03:01.630> people<00:03:02.019> expect<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.800> not<00:03:02.950> going<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.220> be

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.150 
around as if you can see him anyways
next<00:03:45.340> question<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:47.019> one<00:03:47.200> comes<00:03:47.380> from<00:03:47.530> Shane

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
next question this one comes from Shane

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.979 
next question this one comes from Shane
destroy<00:03:48.579> one<00:03:48.940> saying<00:03:49.329> what<00:03:49.750> are<00:03:49.840> your<00:03:49.959> ideas

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
destroy one saying what are your ideas

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.349 
destroy one saying what are your ideas
for<00:03:50.739> Pikmin<00:03:51.070> types<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.489> gameplay<00:03:51.910> features

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
for Pikmin types and gameplay features

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.360 
for Pikmin types and gameplay features
should<00:03:52.600> be<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.930> Pikmin<00:03:53.170> 3<00:03:54.359> okay<00:03:55.359> um<00:03:56.190> number<00:03:57.190> one

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
should be in Pikmin 3 okay um number one

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.280 
should be in Pikmin 3 okay um number one
I<00:03:57.609> kind<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.450> captain<00:03:58.900> system

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
I kind of like the to captain system

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.740 
I kind of like the to captain system
from<00:03:59.440> Pikmin<00:03:59.799> 2<00:03:59.829> so<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.609> think<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.420> should

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
from Pikmin 2 so I think that should

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.620 
from Pikmin 2 so I think that should
definitely<00:04:02.079> make<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.230> return<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:04.359> know<00:04:04.450> it's

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
definitely make a return you know it's

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.760 
definitely make a return you know it's
nice<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.070> lot<00:04:06.310> easier<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.790> on

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
nice it is a lot easier to on

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.740 
nice it is a lot easier to on
multitask<00:04:08.770> CNG<00:04:09.670> add<00:04:09.760> multiple<00:04:10.210> captains<00:04:10.630> to

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
multitask CNG add multiple captains to

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.520 
multitask CNG add multiple captains to
work<00:04:10.900> with<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:11.890> thought<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.100> was<00:04:12.310> nice<00:04:12.550> um

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
work with so I thought that was nice um

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.580 
work with so I thought that was nice um
maybe<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.680> Wi-Fi<00:04:15.460> co-op<00:04:15.970> story<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.660> mean<00:04:17.019> if<00:04:17.530> they

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
maybe a Wi-Fi co-op story I mean if they

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.349 
maybe a Wi-Fi co-op story I mean if they
don't<00:04:17.890> have<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.130> I'm<00:04:18.370> not<00:04:18.549> gonna<00:04:18.700> cry<00:04:18.940> over<00:04:19.030> it

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
don't have it I'm not gonna cry over it

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.040 
don't have it I'm not gonna cry over it
but<00:04:19.660> that'd<00:04:20.019> be<00:04:20.200> pretty<00:04:20.380> cool<00:04:21.660> once<00:04:22.660> again<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
but that'd be pretty cool once again the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.320 
but that'd be pretty cool once again the
usual<00:04:23.350> battle<00:04:23.680> mode<00:04:23.860> challenge<00:04:24.430> mode<00:04:24.640> those

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
usual battle mode challenge mode those

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.480 
usual battle mode challenge mode those
should<00:04:25.480> probably<00:04:25.840> make<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.020> return<00:04:26.490> Pikmin

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
should probably make a return Pikmin

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.920 
should probably make a return Pikmin
types<00:04:27.850> now<00:04:29.070> other<00:04:30.070> than<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.880> obvious<00:04:30.910> nerf<00:04:31.690> to

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
types now other than the obvious nerf to

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.540 
types now other than the obvious nerf to
the<00:04:32.050> purple<00:04:32.380> Pikmin<00:04:32.740> which<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:33.160> have<00:04:33.280> no<00:04:33.400> idea

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
the purple Pikmin which I have no idea

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.520 
the purple Pikmin which I have no idea
what<00:04:33.880> they<00:04:34.240> want<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.540> do<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:38.380> only

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
what they want to do is that the only

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.830 
what they want to do is that the only
way<00:04:38.770> i<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.370> think<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.940> nerfing<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.540> purple

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
way i can think of nerfing the purple

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.610 
way i can think of nerfing the purple
pigment<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.530> not<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.250> nerf<00:04:42.430> them<00:04:42.730> but<00:04:43.090> to

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
pigment is not to nerf them but to

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.400 
pigment is not to nerf them but to
increase<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:45.130> hazard<00:04:45.550> problem<00:04:46.300> or<00:04:46.810> not<00:04:47.350> a

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
increase the hazard problem or not a

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.010 
increase the hazard problem or not a
problem<00:04:47.920> but<00:04:48.100> like<00:04:48.390> increase<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.630> amount<00:04:49.900> of

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
problem but like increase the amount of

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.510 
problem but like increase the amount of
hazards<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.560> increase<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.980> difficulty<00:04:51.340> of

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
hazards and increase the difficulty of

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.730 
hazards and increase the difficulty of
set<00:04:52.000> hazards<00:04:52.420> therefore<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.140> purple<00:04:53.410> Pikmin

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
set hazards therefore the purple Pikmin

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.640 
set hazards therefore the purple Pikmin
are<00:04:53.890> actually<00:04:54.420> vulnerable<00:04:55.420> and<00:04:55.660> also<00:04:56.380> make<00:04:56.620> a

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
are actually vulnerable and also make a

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.130 
are actually vulnerable and also make a
lot<00:04:56.920> more<00:04:56.950> hazard<00:04:57.460> based<00:04:57.670> enemies<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.960> way

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
lot more hazard based enemies that way

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.540 
lot more hazard based enemies that way
you<00:04:59.200> kind<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.500> have<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.650> use<00:05:00.070> your<00:05:00.220> colored

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
you kind of have to use your colored

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.340 
you kind of have to use your colored
Pikmin<00:05:00.880> but<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.690> know<00:05:01.810> when<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.080> get<00:05:02.200> two

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
Pikmin but you know when you get two

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.870 
Pikmin but you know when you get two
bosses<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.890> have<00:05:02.980> your<00:05:03.130> nice<00:05:03.280> purple<00:05:03.580> pigment

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
suggest for Pikmin I can see easily

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.450 
suggest for Pikmin I can see easily
breaking<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.270> game<00:05:17.370> so<00:05:19.860> yeah<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:20.890> mean<00:05:21.040> it

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
breaking the game so yeah I mean it

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.710 
breaking the game so yeah I mean it
could<00:05:21.580> go<00:05:21.730> either<00:05:21.760> way<00:05:22.060> they<00:05:22.390> can<00:05:22.540> make<00:05:22.690> a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
could go either way they can make a

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.450 
could go either way they can make a
really<00:05:23.200> cool<00:05:23.440> Pikmin<00:05:23.860> type<00:05:24.070> that'd<00:05:24.310> be

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
really cool Pikmin type that'd be

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.940 
really cool Pikmin type that'd be
awesome<00:05:24.729> or<00:05:25.600> they<00:05:25.990> can<00:05:26.169> make<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.320> pigment<00:05:26.830> type

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
awesome or they can make a pigment type

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.440 
awesome or they can make a pigment type
that<00:05:27.130> totally<00:05:27.400> breaks<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.729> game<00:05:27.910> like<00:05:28.120> purple

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
that totally breaks the game like purple

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.780 
that totally breaks the game like purple
Pikmin<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:29.020> mean<00:05:29.290> I'm<00:05:29.590> gonna<00:05:29.800> let<00:05:30.040> Nintendo

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
Pikmin I mean I'm gonna let Nintendo

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.370 
Pikmin I mean I'm gonna let Nintendo
deal<00:05:31.000> with<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.240> because<00:05:31.479> they<00:05:32.050> seem<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.290> be

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
deal with that because they seem to be

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.719 
deal with that because they seem to be
the<00:05:32.500> ones<00:05:32.680> they<00:05:33.550> seem<00:05:33.760> that<00:05:33.790> you<00:05:34.240> know<00:05:34.720> know

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
the ones they seem that you know know

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.090 
the ones they seem that you know know
stuff<00:05:36.729> about<00:05:37.120> Pikmin<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.169> really<00:05:38.890> don't<00:05:39.070> have

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
stuff about Pikmin I really don't have

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.390
