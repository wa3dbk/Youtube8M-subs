 to ride the swell is still good 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 sectioned a swell that is long

 northwestern that has gotten bigger that even more 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 big than expected once again

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 are braked disturbed impaired by the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.530
 wind in the debate that is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 agitated it's not super stalled what there is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 shifts it's down there are some rare 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 sports where it happens to unfold a little 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 bar and a little selective with lamari 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 which is high the waves on blow a little 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 behind the ears is reserved by 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.890
 confirmed researchers to 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.909
 the intermediary is a little bit ask to 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.579
 water but hey there is still a lot 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.840
 a lot of wine that close the evolution 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.340
 for the rest of the day so pu 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.450

 we will see at one meter fifty- one 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.189
 little more established at the end of the day 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.680
