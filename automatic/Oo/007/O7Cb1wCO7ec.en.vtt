but I think your problem is with this
aperture<00:02:58.540> clearing<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.260> aperture<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:02.430> yeah

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
aperture clearing that aperture and yeah

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.090 
aperture clearing that aperture and yeah
let<00:03:03.940> me<00:03:03.970> know
