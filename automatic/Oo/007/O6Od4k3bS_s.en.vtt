00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
to prepare yourself for fight because

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.539 
to prepare yourself for fight because

so<00:03:14.549> I've<00:03:14.849> got<00:03:15.620> my<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.980> think<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.519> a

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
so I've got my I think it's like a

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.750 
so I've got my I think it's like a
Diedrich<00:03:18.090> sword<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:20.040> thought<00:03:20.459> it'd<00:03:20.609> make<00:03:20.639> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
Diedrich sword and I thought it'd make a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.530 
Diedrich sword and I thought it'd make a
mistake<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.290> but<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:23.489> careful<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.209> want

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
mistake it but I be careful if you want

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.000 
mistake it but I be careful if you want
to<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.440> need<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.620> make<00:03:25.829> sure

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
to do this you can need to make sure

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.309 
to do this you can need to make sure
because<00:03:26.250> once<00:03:26.730> you've<00:03:27.090> done<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:27.569> cannot

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
because once you've done it you cannot

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.150 
because once you've done it you cannot
get<00:03:28.739> your<00:03:28.980> werewolf<00:03:29.370> spirit<00:03:30.090> back<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:32.040> then

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
get your werewolf spirit back and then

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.520 
get your werewolf spirit back and then
just<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.489> bit<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.760> heads<00:03:32.940> up<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.049> only<00:03:34.260> do

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
just a bit of a heads up so I only do

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.680 
just a bit of a heads up so I only do
this<00:03:34.650> let<00:03:34.829> me<00:03:34.859> make<00:03:35.069> sure<00:03:35.099> I<00:03:35.310> I'm<00:03:36.150> doing<00:03:36.599> this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
this let me make sure I I'm doing this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.180 
this let me make sure I I'm doing this
because<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.380> personal<00:03:37.919> I've<00:03:38.069> never<00:03:38.519> used<00:03:39.030> it

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
because in personal I've never used it
