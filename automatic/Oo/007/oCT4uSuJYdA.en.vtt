modification<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.130> pedal<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:33.180> it's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
modification to this pedal I think it's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.780 
modification to this pedal I think it's
like<00:00:33.480> 50<00:00:33.809> bucks<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.290> maybe<00:00:34.440> 75<00:00:34.920> bucks<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> don't

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
like 50 bucks or maybe 75 bucks I don't

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.319 
like 50 bucks or maybe 75 bucks I don't
know

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
know

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.049 
know
you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.620> ts9<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.129> 100<00:00:38.430> bucks<00:00:38.579> then<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you know the ts9 is 100 bucks then you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.709 
you know the ts9 is 100 bucks then you
basically<00:00:39.600> ship<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.500> off<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.460> guy<00:00:41.700> he<00:00:42.059> he

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
basically ship it off to this guy he he

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290 
basically ship it off to this guy he he
he<00:00:43.320> mods<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> entails

he mods it for you and what that entails

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.069 
he mods it for you and what that entails
is<00:00:45.710> he<00:00:46.710> bypasses<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.550> big<00:00:47.760> foot<00:00:48.390> switch<00:00:48.629> here

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is he bypasses the big foot switch here

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.369 
is he bypasses the big foot switch here
and<00:00:49.500> gives<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> new<00:00:50.100> toggle<00:00:50.969> switch<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and gives you a new toggle switch and of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.580 
and gives you a new toggle switch and of
course<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.399> sounds<00:00:54.140> it's<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> different

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
course it sounds it's got a different

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
course it sounds it's got a different
sound<00:00:55.739> structure<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> too<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> figured

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
sound structure to it too so I figured

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470 
sound structure to it too so I figured
what<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.190> play<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.059> side<00:01:00.300> by<00:01:00.329> side

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
what I do is just play them side by side

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.440 
what I do is just play them side by side
I<00:01:00.989> figured<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:03.680> for<00:01:04.680> each<00:01:05.450> setting

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
I figured what we do is for each setting

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
I figured what we do is for each setting
I<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.290> three<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:08.490> different

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
I like to do like three three different

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
I like to do like three three different
settings<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.049> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
settings you can see kind of kind of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
settings you can see kind of kind of
what<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> difference<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> figured<00:01:13.740> we'd

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
what the difference is so I figured we'd

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.630 
what the difference is so I figured we'd
start<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:15.240> low<00:01:15.869> drive<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.310> high

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
start out with a low drive and a high

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.570 
start out with a low drive and a high
level<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.470> we'll<00:01:19.650> probably<00:01:19.770> keep<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> EQ

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
level and we'll probably keep the EQ

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
level and we'll probably keep the EQ
flat<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.180> three<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> might<00:01:21.990> bump<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
flat for all three I might bump it up a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.640 
flat for all three I might bump it up a
little<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.460> little<00:01:23.880> hotter<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> highs<00:01:24.840> but

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
little a little hotter in the highs but

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
little a little hotter in the highs but
um<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.490> would<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:28.759> like<00:01:29.759> solos<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
um that would be like for like solos and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
um that would be like for like solos and
stuff<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.290> pedal<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.829> really

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
stuff which is what this pedal is really

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
stuff which is what this pedal is really
good<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.110> bringing<00:01:34.110> your

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that case you kind of do the opposite of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580 
that case you kind of do the opposite of
the<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.750> setting<00:01:46.110> which<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the of the first setting which is you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
the of the first setting which is you
kind<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> crank<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> drive<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.119> maybe

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
kind of crank the drive up and maybe

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.649 
kind of crank the drive up and maybe
bring<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.259> level<00:01:49.770> down<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.700> bit<00:01:50.880> just

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
bring the level down a little bit just

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.749 
bring the level down a little bit just
so<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.020> blasting<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.310> then

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so it's not blasting it out and then

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.600 
so it's not blasting it out and then
you'd<00:01:53.880> adjust<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> EQ<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.590> tone<00:01:55.890> knob<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you'd adjust the EQ the tone knob to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.740 
you'd adjust the EQ the tone knob to
just<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.390> preference<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.759> anyway<00:01:59.759> there'll

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
just your preference so anyway there'll

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.440 
just your preference so anyway there'll
be<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> picture<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.320> each<00:02:01.680> setting<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.579> hope

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
be a picture of each setting so I hope

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.760 
be a picture of each setting so I hope
