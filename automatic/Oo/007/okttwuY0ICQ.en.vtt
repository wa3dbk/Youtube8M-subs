 consider the environment 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.890
 he 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 in global problems such as climate change 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.999
 the government of the republic has chosen to join the efforts 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:37.170
 international agreements by signing important agreements among which 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.960
 Convention on Biological Diversity 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.250
 in the framework convention of the united nations on climate change and its

 it's one and Florentine stress 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.690
 and the objectives of 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.830
 of the organization of the united nations these agreements have as 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.980
 purpose 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.970
 make mexico an active participant in sustainable development 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.229
 The management of solid waste has been characterized by the lack of 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.710
 planning and infrastructure 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.750
 added to it in the absence of spaces for its disposal 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.900
 has generated conflicts between municipalities and states 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.830
 hazardous waste alleges the level of complexity of the problem as it does not 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.080
 they have developed enough spaces for their confinement 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.220
 the waste deposited doctor highly tend to contaminate the 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.009
 phreatic mantos 'days of keeping' dreams so inadequate for 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.149
 any use according to 2005 inegi data 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.109
 Generation growth between 2000 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.109
 brazil with him goal of 6% 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.669
 It has been 60 percent organic 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.669
 and 40% inorganic 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.500
 The solution to this problem requires addressing specific issues of the 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.729
 environmental agenda 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.969
 how to carry out actions on a national scale 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.619
 that transcend the spheres of action of a single unit a 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.869
 governmental institution 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.259
 and that involve 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.559
 the active participation of society as a whole 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.039
 the grass 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.629
 we understand that the solution will be given to the extent that we understand that this 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.389
 it's a social phenomenon 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.769
 that depends on the style of development that we adopt and the behavior of the 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.959
 individual demanding satisfaction in the consumer society 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:02.920
 from this 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.869
 to have our pollution level 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:06.899
 today 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.460
 many actions are being taken 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.090
 to correct deviations in ecological environmental matters 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.449
 but nevertheless 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.329
 one of the biggest problems that arise 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.200
 it is the resistance 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.609
 behavioral science of individuals 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.339
 to transform into the mound 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.339
 their habits in function of the common good 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.779
 The conservation of the environment 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.879
 It has ceased to be a topic of discussion for the intellectuals and has become 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.179
 political demands of citizenship 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:43.739
 and that is why it is added to the national effort of modern Mexico 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.319
 through the production and implementation of systems 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.560
 and economic in the handling of solid waste that guarantee the protection 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.560
 of humanity if its environment 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:03.389
