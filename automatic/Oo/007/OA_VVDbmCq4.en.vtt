you can use it in a daisy chain and I
did<00:01:56.399> try<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.030> about<00:01:57.299> 3<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:57.899> 4<00:01:58.110> devices

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
did try that with about 3 or 4 devices

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.190 
did try that with about 3 or 4 devices
at<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> time<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> works<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.210> well<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
at a time and it works really well it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
at a time and it works really well it
does<00:02:01.439> require<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:02.100> separate<00:02:02.850> power<00:02:03.090> adaptor

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
does require a separate power adaptor

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.389 
does require a separate power adaptor
but<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:03.899> normal<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.469> desktop<00:02:04.890> solution

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
but that's normal for a desktop solution

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.520 
but that's normal for a desktop solution
now<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.180> question<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:07.049> much<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.409> this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
now the question is how much does this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.580 
now the question is how much does this
cost<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:09.330> thunderbolt<00:02:09.780> doctor<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.289> cos

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
cost the thunderbolt doctor here cos

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.010 
cost the thunderbolt doctor here cos
hundred<00:02:11.160> ninety<00:02:11.550> dollars<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.840> not

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
hundred ninety dollars which is not

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.400 
hundred ninety dollars which is not
cheap

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
cheap

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.560 
cheap
but<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.890> still<00:02:14.040> cheaper<00:02:14.490> than<00:02:14.670> many<00:02:15.000> other

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
but it's still cheaper than many other

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.440 
but it's still cheaper than many other
funnybone<00:02:16.440> solution<00:02:17.270> unfortunately<00:02:18.270> like

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
funnybone solution unfortunately like

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.360 
funnybone solution unfortunately like
many<00:02:18.600> other<00:02:18.840> Thunderball<00:02:19.350> devices<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.130> does

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
many other Thunderball devices it does

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.940 
many other Thunderball devices it does
not<00:02:20.610> include<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.390> Thunderbolt<00:02:21.960> cable<00:02:22.500> which

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
not include the Thunderbolt cable which

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.710 
not include the Thunderbolt cable which
you<00:02:22.980> will<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.940> from<00:02:24.120> Apple<00:02:24.480> for

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you will have to get from Apple for

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.710 
you will have to get from Apple for
another<00:02:24.900> fifty<00:02:25.350> dollars<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.610> testing<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
another fifty dollars in my testing the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.050 
another fifty dollars in my testing the
adapter<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:28.350> actually<00:02:28.560> really<00:02:29.310> fast<00:02:29.580> faster

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
adapter here actually really fast faster

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.180 
adapter here actually really fast faster
than<00:02:30.210> some<00:02:30.480> other<00:02:30.720> Thunderbolt<00:02:31.380> devices<00:02:31.980> I've

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
than some other Thunderbolt devices I've

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.430 
than some other Thunderbolt devices I've
seen<00:02:32.490> for<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.360> reason<00:02:33.750> plus<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
seen for that reason plus the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.340 
seen for that reason plus the
flexibility<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.880> device<00:02:36.480> actually<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.170> of

flexibility this device actually one of
