00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.459
 [Music] 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:26.210
 [Music] 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.009
 and today we are going to reuse cans and we 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.529
 let's get in shape by doing these 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.960
 dumbbells or weights to exercise 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.540
 and tone our arms so 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.540
 do not miss this tutorial we started 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.590
 [Applause] 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.989
 we are going to take one of our cans 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 and we're going to start making a mix with 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.590
 cast 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.100
 and a little water 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.500
 [Music] 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.130
 you have to go adding a little bit 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:06.579
 so that you are not going to happen 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.579
 [Music] 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.689
 it has to be the mixture until full 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.509
 the whole can then you have to go 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.770
 adding more plaster and more water since 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.920
 is almost full 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 you're going to start putting stones 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 [Music] 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 and the stick also this stick is a great 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.920
 Broomstick that broke and cut it 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.730
 very easy with a hacksaw 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.730
 [Music] 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 I have the stick in the center now yes 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.860
 place the stones well around 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 that is well fixed 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.229
 now you have to let it dry 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.240
 [Music] 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.460
 and that the first part of 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 our dumbbell we will do the same 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.870
 what we did with the first 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.700
 [Music] 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.400
 you have to make the mixture with plaster and water 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:18.160
 now we are going to expose the stick of our 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.670
 side in the middle and we're going to fill in 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.670
 stones 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.600
 and you're also going to have to let it dry 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.330
 very good since it has dried your 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.740
 dumbbell is going to stay like that so you do not 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.900
 it looks ugly we are going to cover it 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.150
 I'm going to stop it with a piece of foami 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.910
 this was my have an apparent as of 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.130
 towel and you can erase it with what 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.940
 want 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.400
 I'm going to mark four circles first 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.610
 I will mark them on a background sheet and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.930
 I'm going to cut them 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.719
 [Music] 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.569
 now let's take a leaf of ate 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.939
 eva rubber 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.680
 we're going to fold it in half and we're going 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:09.550
 shorten 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:13.170
 [Music] 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.170
 and we're just going to paste it 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.180
 and we are going to cut the excess 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.090
 and the circle we're going to stick it on 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.270
 top part 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.110
 [Music] 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.720
 [Applause] 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.280
 now the circle wanted in the part of 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.830
 in 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.850
 let's make it to a cut 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.850
 a circle 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.190
 more or less 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:58.480
 [Music] 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.480
 and a cut 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.699
 [Music] 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.569
 you have to take all the excess 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.560
 first so you can paste it well 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.560
 and you are going to paste it 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.220
 do not 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.319
 [Music] 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.949
 and finally what we are going to do is that 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.800
 we are going to put our adhesive tape 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.470
 decorated on the stick so it is not so 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:51.040
 but you can also paint it 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:51.040
 [Music] 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.810
 and here will be your dumbbells its 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.520
 recycled weights to tone up 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.230
 our arms 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.240
 they weigh approximately 2 kilos 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.220
 I'm sorry 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.980
 maybe a kilo and a half do not I do not know what 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.020
 I know with this attitude but according to what 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.410
 want you to weigh is the size of the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.800
 can not you use? 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:24.270
 we want to put something like this or good at 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.270
 better many places 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.540
 but in reality there is this kind of 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.030
 Dumbbells are more like for girls 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.770
 that we want to tone the arms and if 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.770
 You are a boy, obviously you can 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.680
 make a lot heavier with 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.240
 much bigger cans 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.950
 I hope you liked this 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.900
