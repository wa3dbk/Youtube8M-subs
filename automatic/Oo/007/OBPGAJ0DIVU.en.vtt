00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
differently when you've got the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.819 
differently when you've got the
opportunity<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.890> subscribe<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.059> well

opportunity to subscribe to that as well

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.740

now<00:00:46.829> Francis<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.520> asked<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> question<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.329> do

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
now Francis is asked the question how do

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
now Francis is asked the question how do
you<00:00:48.899> check<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.350> chain<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> needs

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you check your chain to see if it needs

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.729 
you check your chain to see if it needs
replacing<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.539> I've<00:00:51.719> been<00:00:51.930> using<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.350> chain

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
replacing now I've been using a chain

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.310 
replacing now I've been using a chain
where<00:00:53.160> tool<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.940> years<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.020> particular

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
where tool for years now this particular

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
where tool for years now this particular
one<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.920> called<00:00:56.420> prolink<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> pro

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one it's called prolink this is a pro

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.900 
one it's called prolink this is a pro
league<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.190> simple<00:00:59.370> tool<00:00:59.760> now

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
league one it's a very simple tool now

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.819 
league one it's a very simple tool now
how<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.239> works<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.379> insert

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
how it works is that you just insert

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
how it works is that you just insert
this<00:01:02.100> against<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> links<00:01:03.239> within<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.660> chain

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this against the links within your chain

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
this against the links within your chain
and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.129> let<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> chain<00:01:05.670> drop

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and then you just let the chain drop

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
and then you just let the chain drop
down<00:01:06.570> into<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.200> chain<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.770> other<00:01:08.010> side

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
down into your chain on the other side

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
down into your chain on the other side
of<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> there's<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> scale<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.350> 50

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of it and there's a scale here from 50

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.039 
of it and there's a scale here from 50
to<00:01:10.799> 100<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.060> idea<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> you'll<00:01:12.840> see

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
to 100 and the idea is that you'll see

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
to 100 and the idea is that you'll see
as<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.590> chain<00:01:13.860> where's<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.520> drop

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
as your chain where's this will drop

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
as your chain where's this will drop
further<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> further<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.840> into<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> chain

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
further and further down into the chain

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
further and further down into the chain
indicating<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.360> simple

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
indicating it's where it's a very simple

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.950 
indicating it's where it's a very simple
tool<00:01:18.960> now<00:01:19.590> between<00:01:20.220> 50<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.729> 75<00:01:21.240> percent<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
tool now between 50 and 75 percent is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.420 
tool now between 50 and 75 percent is
where<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> would<00:01:22.409> normally<00:01:22.439> replace<00:01:23.189> your

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
where you would normally replace your

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
where you would normally replace your
chain<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.240> gives<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> good<00:01:24.840> indicator

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
chain so that gives you a good indicator

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
chain so that gives you a good indicator
and<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.400> i<00:01:26.430> clean<00:01:26.850> my

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and what I do is that when i clean my

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.170 
and what I do is that when i clean my
bike<00:01:27.560> every<00:01:28.560> couple<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> weeks<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.970> drop

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
bike every couple of weeks i just drop

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
bike every couple of weeks i just drop
this<00:01:30.329> tool<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> chain<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.650> check<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> see

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this tool into the chain to check to see

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.490 
this tool into the chain to check to see
the<00:01:32.549> chain<00:01:32.790> where<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> starts<00:01:34.290> showing

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the chain where and if it starts showing

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.090 
the chain where and if it starts showing
signs<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.130> wear<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.700> i<00:01:35.820> replace<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> chain

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
signs of wear then i replace the chain

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.770 
signs of wear then i replace the chain
now<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.280> important<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> remember<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.450> your

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
now it's important to remember that your

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.109 
now it's important to remember that your
chain<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.650> cassette<00:01:41.189> work<00:01:41.850> together

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
chain and your cassette work together

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560 
chain and your cassette work together
and<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:43.020> wear<00:01:43.500> together<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.070> well<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and they wear together as well so the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
and they wear together as well so the
general<00:01:45.869> rule<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> thumb<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.009> want

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
general rule of thumb is that you want

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.910 
general rule of thumb is that you want
to<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.430> four<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.360> three<00:01:48.869> chains<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
to get four or three chains to a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580 
to get four or three chains to a
cassette<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.270> only<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
cassette now you can only do that if you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
cassette now you can only do that if you
replace<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.040> chain<00:01:53.780> regularly<00:01:54.780> before<00:01:54.990> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
replace your chain regularly before it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
replace your chain regularly before it
starts<00:01:55.770> wearing<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.430> worn<00:01:56.790> pattern<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> SF

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
starts wearing a worn pattern in the SF

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.190 
starts wearing a worn pattern in the SF
now<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> leave<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.790> chain<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.450> too<00:02:00.869> long

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
now if you leave your chain on too long

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
now if you leave your chain on too long
and<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.950> starts<00:02:02.310> wearing<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.729> warren

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and it starts wearing that warren

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
and it starts wearing that warren
pattern<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.689> your<00:02:03.810> cassette<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.950> will

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
pattern and your cassette what will

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920 
pattern and your cassette what will
happen<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> go<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> replace

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
happen is that when you go to replace

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.529 
happen is that when you go to replace
your<00:02:07.170> chain<00:02:07.409> because<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.550> new<00:02:08.940> chain<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.420> be

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
your chain because the new chain will be

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.669 
your chain because the new chain will be
running<00:02:09.840> against<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.289> wall

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
running against that wall

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.920 
running against that wall
patent<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.430> chain<00:02:11.790> won't<00:02:12.030> mesh<00:02:12.299> properly<00:02:12.719> and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
patent the chain won't mesh properly and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.229 
patent the chain won't mesh properly and
it'll<00:02:13.170> skip<00:02:13.439> and<00:02:13.680> sometimes<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.819> see<00:02:15.030> people

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
it'll skip and sometimes you see people

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.270 
it'll skip and sometimes you see people
out<00:02:15.870> there<00:02:16.049> on<00:02:16.200> bikes<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:16.709> when<00:02:16.890> they<00:02:16.980> start

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
out there on bikes and when they start

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.640 
out there on bikes and when they start
loading<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.060> bike<00:02:18.349> perhaps<00:02:19.349> when<00:02:19.530> they're

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
loading up the bike perhaps when they're

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.229 
loading up the bike perhaps when they're
climbing<00:02:20.010> holes<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.519> sprinting<00:02:21.060> or

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
climbing holes or sprinting or

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.390 
climbing holes or sprinting or
accelerating<00:02:22.140> away<00:02:22.230> from<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> lights<00:02:22.739> you'll

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
accelerating away from the lights you'll

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.059 
accelerating away from the lights you'll
feel<00:02:23.670> them<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.719> chain<00:02:25.019> or<00:02:25.200> slip<00:02:25.530> against<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
feel them the chain or slip against the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.129 
feel them the chain or slip against the
cassette<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.359> dead<00:02:27.629> giveaway<00:02:27.719> that

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
cassette and that's a dead giveaway that

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.220 
cassette and that's a dead giveaway that
you<00:02:28.560> kiss<00:02:28.799> it's<00:02:29.040> too<00:02:29.459> far<00:02:29.790> warned<00:02:30.239> against<00:02:31.109> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
you kiss it's too far warned against you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.949 
you kiss it's too far warned against you
chained<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:32.219> be<00:02:32.459> able<00:02:32.639> to<00:02:32.969> write<00:02:33.180> properly<00:02:33.689> and

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
chained to be able to write properly and

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.289 
chained to be able to write properly and
you'll<00:02:34.409> need<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.739> replace<00:02:34.859> both<00:02:35.489> now<00:02:36.239> of

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
you'll need to replace both now of

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.089 
you'll need to replace both now of
course<00:02:36.480> replacing<00:02:37.109> both<00:02:37.469> together<00:02:37.709> as

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
course replacing both together as

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.160 
course replacing both together as
expensive<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.060> recommendation<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:40.139> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
expensive so the recommendation is that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.710 
expensive so the recommendation is that
you<00:02:40.409> replace<00:02:40.859> your<00:02:40.889> chain<00:02:41.310> regularly<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.090> not

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
you replace your chain regularly and not

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.270 
you replace your chain regularly and not
get<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.079> warm<00:02:43.319> pattern<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.829> like<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.040> say

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
get that warm pattern and like I say

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.080 
get that warm pattern and like I say
you'll<00:02:44.489> get<00:02:44.760> usually<00:02:45.510> three<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.109> four<00:02:46.590> chains

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
you'll get usually three to four chains

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.000 
you'll get usually three to four chains
percocet<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> time<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.650> takes<00:02:49.829> for

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
percocet now the time that it takes for

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.949 
percocet now the time that it takes for
your<00:02:50.129> chain<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.879> kiss<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.419> where<00:02:51.629> are

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
your chain and you kiss it to where are

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.409 
your chain and you kiss it to where are
depending<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.769> few<00:02:52.889> things<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:54.090> most

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
depending on a few things the most

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.690 
depending on a few things the most
important<00:02:55.079> thing<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.469> how<00:02:55.919> clean<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.430> chain

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
important thing is how clean your chain

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.209 
important thing is how clean your chain
is<00:02:56.909> if<00:02:57.419> you've<00:02:57.689> got<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> duty<00:02:58.319> chain<00:02:58.709> that's<00:02:58.980> got

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
is if you've got a duty chain that's got

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.339 
is if you've got a duty chain that's got
a<00:02:59.250> lot<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.489> grit<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.939> it<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:00.689> that's<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.260> to

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
a lot of grit on it then that's going to

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.440 
a lot of grit on it then that's going to
wear<00:03:01.590> out<00:03:01.620> your<00:03:01.769> cassette<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.669> your<00:03:02.969> chain<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
wear out your cassette and your chain a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.319 
wear out your cassette and your chain a
lot<00:03:03.840> more<00:03:04.290> quickly<00:03:04.680> than<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.909> keep<00:03:06.180> it

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
lot more quickly than if you keep it

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.750 
lot more quickly than if you keep it
quite<00:03:06.629> clean<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.590> regular<00:03:08.189> cleaning<00:03:08.639> of<00:03:08.730> your

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
quite clean so regular cleaning of your

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.229 
quite clean so regular cleaning of your
chain<00:03:09.120> will<00:03:09.569> help<00:03:10.019> ensure<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.909> get<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
chain will help ensure that you get the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.879 
chain will help ensure that you get the
best<00:03:12.269> life<00:03:12.840> out<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.169> both<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.620> those

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
best life out of both of those

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.680 
best life out of both of those
components<00:03:14.180> now<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.239> other<00:03:15.419> thing<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
components now the other thing that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.899 
components now the other thing that
influences<00:03:16.349> chain<00:03:16.739> where<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.459> weight<00:03:17.699> of

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
influences chain where is the weight of

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.699 
influences chain where is the weight of
the<00:03:18.000> writer<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.449> the<00:03:18.599> amount<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.199> power<00:03:19.560> that

they're putting into the bike now the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.689 
they're putting into the bike now the
heavier<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.530> rider<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.099> more<00:03:23.430> power

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
heavier the rider and the more power

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.000 
heavier the rider and the more power
they<00:03:24.150> put<00:03:24.389> into<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> bike<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.319> shorter<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
they put into the bike the shorter the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.580 
they put into the bike the shorter the
lifespan<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.849> chain<00:03:27.419> so<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.199> recapping

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
lifespan of the chain so just recapping

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.949 
lifespan of the chain so just recapping
the<00:03:28.739> two<00:03:29.189> important<00:03:29.879> things<00:03:29.939> to<00:03:30.359> remember<00:03:30.389> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the two important things to remember is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.409 
the two important things to remember is
just<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.799> replace<00:03:32.069> your<00:03:32.370> chain<00:03:32.639> regularly<00:03:33.239> and

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
just to replace your chain regularly and

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.050 
just to replace your chain regularly and
keep<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.290> clean<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:34.859> will<00:03:35.400> enable<00:03:35.760> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
keep it clean and that will enable you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.360 
keep it clean and that will enable you
to<00:03:36.090> get<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.479> most<00:03:36.510> out<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.199> your<00:03:37.859> chain<00:03:38.159> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
to get the most out of your chain and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.530 
to get the most out of your chain and
cassette

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.380 

so<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.500> next<00:03:42.739> question<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.430> by<00:03:43.849> Donna<00:03:44.180> and

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
so the next question is by Donna and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.199 
so the next question is by Donna and
she's<00:03:44.689> asked<00:03:45.409> how<00:03:46.189> do<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.549> get<00:03:46.730> better<00:03:47.000> at

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
she's asked how do you get better at

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.349 
she's asked how do you get better at
tacking<00:03:47.840> on<00:03:47.959> Hills<00:03:48.530> now<00:03:49.250> attacking<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:50.030> Hills

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
tacking on Hills now attacking on Hills

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.990 
tacking on Hills now attacking on Hills
requires<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.859> develop<00:03:52.099> quite<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.579> huge

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
requires you to develop quite a huge

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.270 
requires you to develop quite a huge
amount<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.450> power<00:03:53.719> over<00:03:54.049> a<00:03:54.290> short<00:03:54.650> period<00:03:54.859> of

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
amount of power over a short period of

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.940 
amount of power over a short period of
time<00:03:55.659> there's<00:03:56.659> two<00:03:56.989> ways<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.530> address

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
time there's two ways that I address

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.800 
time there's two ways that I address
this<00:03:58.159> issue<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.760> first<00:03:59.120> thing<00:03:59.359> is<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.540> we

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
this issue the first thing is that we

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.050 
this issue the first thing is that we
work<00:04:00.079> on<00:04:00.349> developing<00:04:00.560> strength<00:04:01.459> within<00:04:01.790> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
work on developing strength within the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.630 
work on developing strength within the
athlete<00:04:02.540> off<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.019> bike<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.409> this<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.310> really

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
athlete off the bike and this is really

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880 
athlete off the bike and this is really
important<00:04:05.329> if<00:04:05.480> you're<00:04:05.989> able<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.349> develop<00:04:06.769> that

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
important if you're able to develop that

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.649 
important if you're able to develop that
strength<00:04:07.280> off<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.579> bike<00:04:07.790> then<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.420> will<00:04:08.540> be

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
strength off the bike then you will be

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.690 
strength off the bike then you will be
able<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.959> transmit<00:04:09.409> that<00:04:09.709> onto<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.280> bike<00:04:10.430> and

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
able to transmit that onto the bike and

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.780 
able to transmit that onto the bike and
develop<00:04:11.480> more<00:04:11.750> power<00:04:12.139> that<00:04:12.439> you<00:04:12.590> require<00:04:13.040> to

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
develop more power that you require to

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.020 
develop more power that you require to
be<00:04:13.819> able<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.389> do<00:04:14.810> big<00:04:15.470> huge<00:04:15.950> attacks<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.699> the

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
be able to do big huge attacks on the

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.539 
be able to do big huge attacks on the
hills<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:18.049> that's<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.440> first<00:04:18.709> key<00:04:19.190> thing<00:04:19.519> is

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
hills so that's the first key thing is

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.999 
hills so that's the first key thing is
to<00:04:19.759> develop<00:04:20.180> their<00:04:20.479> power<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.139> bike<00:04:21.349> now

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
to develop their power of the bike now

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:23.680 
to develop their power of the bike now
the<00:04:22.099> second<00:04:22.610> most<00:04:22.639> important<00:04:23.270> thing<00:04:23.449> is<00:04:23.660> to

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the second most important thing is to

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.659 
the second most important thing is to
start<00:04:24.110> working<00:04:24.560> on<00:04:24.680> training<00:04:25.099> yourself<00:04:25.310> to

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
start working on training yourself to

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.360 
start working on training yourself to
develop<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.720> power<00:04:27.050> on<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> bike<00:04:27.620> so<00:04:28.130> what<00:04:28.340> I

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
develop that power on the bike so what I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.520 
develop that power on the bike so what I
do<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.639> I<00:04:28.849> get<00:04:29.030> my<00:04:29.180> athletes<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.960> work<00:04:30.289> on

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
do is I get my athletes to work on

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.060 
do is I get my athletes to work on
developing<00:04:30.949> this<00:04:31.669> power<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:33.080> bike<00:04:33.349> by

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
developing this power on the bike by

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.100 
developing this power on the bike by
doing<00:04:34.520> hill<00:04:34.759> sprints<00:04:35.060> or<00:04:35.300> doing<00:04:35.720> big

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
doing hill sprints or doing big

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.070 
doing hill sprints or doing big
accelerations<00:04:37.099> on<00:04:37.280> Hills<00:04:37.759> now<00:04:38.479> you<00:04:38.539> can<00:04:38.810> also

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
accelerations on Hills now you can also

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.589 
accelerations on Hills now you can also
do<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.860> flat<00:04:40.160> but<00:04:40.759> it's<00:04:40.910> best<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.419> do<00:04:41.570> it

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
do this on a flat but it's best to do it

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.930 
do this on a flat but it's best to do it
on<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.020> hill<00:04:42.259> and<00:04:42.500> how<00:04:43.190> we<00:04:43.250> do<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.699> is

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
on the hill and how we do this is

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420 
on the hill and how we do this is
through<00:04:44.539> hill<00:04:44.870> repeats<00:04:45.169> now<00:04:45.889> what<00:04:46.039> we<00:04:46.130> do<00:04:46.280> is

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
through hill repeats now what we do is

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.430 
through hill repeats now what we do is
we<00:04:46.550> find<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.909> hill<00:04:47.150> in<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.419> local<00:04:47.810> area<00:04:47.990> that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
we find a hill in the local area that

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.379 
we find a hill in the local area that
the<00:04:48.530> athlete<00:04:48.680> loves<00:04:49.099> it<00:04:49.820> doesn't<00:04:50.150> have<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.360> be

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
the athlete loves it doesn't have to be

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.629 
the athlete loves it doesn't have to be
a<00:04:50.510> very<00:04:50.780> long<00:04:51.050> hill<00:04:51.349> it<00:04:51.500> can<00:04:51.680> just<00:04:52.099> be<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.310> hill

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
a very long hill it can just be a hill

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.339 
a very long hill it can just be a hill
around<00:04:52.880> about<00:04:53.449> 250<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:55.240> 750<00:04:56.240> meters<00:04:56.570> now<00:04:57.199> these

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
around about 250 to 750 meters now these

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.370 
around about 250 to 750 meters now these
attacks<00:04:57.830> are<00:04:58.039> done<00:04:58.490> at<00:04:59.030> maximum<00:04:59.930> intensity

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
attacks are done at maximum intensity

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.230 
attacks are done at maximum intensity
and<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:01.070> also<00:05:01.310> want<00:05:01.639> to<00:05:01.699> give<00:05:01.820> yourself

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
and you also want to give yourself

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.020 
and you also want to give yourself
plenty<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.840> time<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:03.470> between<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:04.159> efforts<00:05:04.460> to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
plenty of time in between the efforts to

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.089 
plenty of time in between the efforts to
recover<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.659> we<00:05:06.169> generally<00:05:06.320> work<00:05:06.860> on

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
recover and we generally work on

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.550 
recover and we generally work on
somewhere<00:05:07.430> between<00:05:07.580> five<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.419> ten<00:05:08.990> efforts

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
somewhere between five and ten efforts

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.860 
somewhere between five and ten efforts
during<00:05:09.889> a<00:05:10.070> session<00:05:10.310> but<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.180> important<00:05:11.690> key

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
during a session but the important key

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.990 
during a session but the important key
thing<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.139> remember<00:05:12.289> is<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.860> as<00:05:13.430> soon<00:05:13.849> as

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
thing to remember is that as soon as

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.210 
thing to remember is that as soon as
your<00:05:14.180> speed<00:05:14.720> or<00:05:14.990> your<00:05:15.110> power<00:05:15.349> drops<00:05:15.650> off<00:05:15.919> by

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
your speed or your power drops off by

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.520 
your speed or your power drops off by
around<00:05:16.550> about<00:05:16.729> twenty<00:05:17.180> percent<00:05:17.380> then<00:05:18.380> you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
around about twenty percent then you

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.170 
around about twenty percent then you
really<00:05:18.710> have<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:19.070> call<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:19.400> quits<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.849> come

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
really have to call it quits and come

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.719 
really have to call it quits and come
back<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.510> do<00:05:20.659> those<00:05:20.810> efforts<00:05:21.430> another<00:05:22.430> day

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
back and do those efforts another day

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.760 
back and do those efforts another day
now<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.449> idea<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.139> build<00:05:24.470> up<00:05:24.650> these

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
now the idea is that you build up these

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.580 
now the idea is that you build up these
efforts<00:05:25.310> over<00:05:25.699> time<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.570> around<00:05:26.960> about<00:05:27.080> five

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
efforts over time to around about five

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.040 
efforts over time to around about five
or<00:05:27.800> ten<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.280> you<00:05:28.760> want<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.060> vary<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.449> gradient

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
or ten and you want to vary the gradient

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.800 
or ten and you want to vary the gradient
of<00:05:30.169> these<00:05:30.470> efforts<00:05:30.680> as<00:05:31.010> well<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:31.880> you<00:05:31.940> may<00:05:32.539> want

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
of these efforts as well so you may want

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.689 
of these efforts as well so you may want
to<00:05:32.870> look<00:05:32.990> at<00:05:33.139> a<00:05:33.320> three<00:05:33.680> percent<00:05:33.979> gradient<00:05:34.520> and

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
to look at a three percent gradient and

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.149 
to look at a three percent gradient and
perhaps<00:05:35.000> us<00:05:35.300> a<00:05:35.539> seven<00:05:36.320> percent<00:05:36.560> gradient<00:05:37.039> and

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
perhaps us a seven percent gradient and

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.490 
perhaps us a seven percent gradient and
then<00:05:37.639> throw<00:05:38.120> in<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.419> few<00:05:38.599> twelve<00:05:38.900> percent<00:05:39.259> SIF

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
then throw in a few twelve percent SIF

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.050 
then throw in a few twelve percent SIF
you've<00:05:39.530> got<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:39.949> in<00:05:40.130> your<00:05:40.280> local<00:05:40.490> area<00:05:40.820> as

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
you've got that in your local area as

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.089 
you've got that in your local area as
well

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.589 

now<00:05:45.099> the<00:05:45.160> last<00:05:45.460> question<00:05:45.879> that<00:05:46.030> we<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.389> is

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
now the last question that we have is

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.680 
now the last question that we have is
from<00:05:47.349> Alistair<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.039> his<00:05:48.280> asked<00:05:48.520> question<00:05:49.000> how

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
from Alistair and his asked question how

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.990 
from Alistair and his asked question how
do<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:49.900> get<00:05:50.050> your<00:05:50.199> fitness<00:05:50.410> back<00:05:50.770> after<00:05:51.639> 20

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
do you get your fitness back after 20

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.119 
do you get your fitness back after 20
years<00:05:52.120> off<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.690> bike<00:05:52.870> now<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.800> great<00:05:54.099> thing

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
years off the bike now the great thing

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.100 
years off the bike now the great thing
about<00:05:54.340> cycling<00:05:55.030> is<00:05:55.150> that<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.569> develop<00:05:55.990> this

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
about cycling is that you develop this

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.680 
about cycling is that you develop this
huge<00:05:56.590> base<00:05:56.979> or<00:05:57.220> depth<00:05:57.580> as<00:05:57.789> you<00:05:58.090> ride<00:05:58.300> your<00:05:58.330> bike

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
huge base or depth as you ride your bike

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.499 
huge base or depth as you ride your bike
and<00:05:58.930> this<00:05:59.889> is<00:06:00.069> really<00:06:00.430> great<00:06:00.789> when<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.330> get

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509 
and this is really great when you get

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.080 
and this is really great when you get
back<00:06:01.780> into<00:06:01.990> writing<00:06:02.470> after<00:06:02.860> 20<00:06:03.310> years<00:06:03.460> now<00:06:04.000> it

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
back into writing after 20 years now it

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.610 
back into writing after 20 years now it
does<00:06:04.240> take<00:06:04.569> a<00:06:04.599> little<00:06:04.840> bit<00:06:04.960> of<00:06:05.139> time<00:06:05.319> to<00:06:05.500> get

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
does take a little bit of time to get

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.379 
does take a little bit of time to get
back<00:06:05.860> into<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.310> groove<00:06:06.430> but<00:06:06.729> you'll<00:06:06.940> find

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
back into the groove but you'll find

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.260 
back into the groove but you'll find
that<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:08.620> speed<00:06:09.099> in<00:06:09.340> which<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.610> takes<00:06:09.639> you<00:06:10.090> to

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
that the speed in which it takes you to

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.390 
that the speed in which it takes you to
get<00:06:10.419> back<00:06:10.659> on<00:06:10.810> top<00:06:10.990> of<00:06:11.169> cycling<00:06:11.590> is<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:12.129> lot

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
get back on top of cycling is a lot

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.070 
get back on top of cycling is a lot
quicker<00:06:12.699> than<00:06:12.970> if<00:06:13.210> you<00:06:13.449> were<00:06:13.599> starting<00:06:13.930> from

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
quicker than if you were starting from

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.439 
quicker than if you were starting from
scratch<00:06:14.259> as<00:06:14.919> some<00:06:15.699> of<00:06:15.819> this<00:06:15.880> has<00:06:16.030> got<00:06:16.210> to<00:06:16.240> do

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
scratch as some of this has got to do

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.029 
scratch as some of this has got to do
with<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:16.690> base<00:06:16.930> that<00:06:17.199> you've<00:06:17.380> developed<00:06:17.740> in

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
with the base that you've developed in

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.820 
with the base that you've developed in
your<00:06:18.190> previous<00:06:18.430> years<00:06:19.150> as<00:06:19.389> a<00:06:19.419> cyclist<00:06:19.840> but

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
your previous years as a cyclist but

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.649 
your previous years as a cyclist but
also<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.370> technique<00:06:21.849> of<00:06:21.940> riding<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.479> bike

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
also the technique of riding the bike

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.839 
also the technique of riding the bike
and<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.349> bike<00:06:23.620> handling<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.430> getting<00:06:24.699> around

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
and the bike handling and getting around

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.360 
and the bike handling and getting around
corners<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.539> and<00:06:25.870> sitting<00:06:26.830> in<00:06:26.919> bunches<00:06:27.310> and

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
corners and and sitting in bunches and

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.610 
corners and and sitting in bunches and
all<00:06:27.819> those<00:06:28.000> skills<00:06:28.509> that<00:06:28.690> you've<00:06:28.870> previously

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
all those skills that you've previously

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.040 
all those skills that you've previously
developed<00:06:30.099> you<00:06:30.729> can<00:06:30.880> obviously<00:06:31.180> tap<00:06:31.659> and<00:06:31.900> do

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
developed you can obviously tap and do

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.350 
developed you can obviously tap and do
very<00:06:32.409> quickly<00:06:32.669> because<00:06:33.669> you've<00:06:33.819> already<00:06:34.150> had

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
very quickly because you've already had

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.809 
very quickly because you've already had
that<00:06:34.569> experience<00:06:34.870> from<00:06:35.500> 20<00:06:35.860> years<00:06:35.979> ago<00:06:36.099> so

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819 
that experience from 20 years ago so

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.580 
that experience from 20 years ago so
just<00:06:37.030> like<00:06:37.180> with<00:06:37.330> any<00:06:37.509> other<00:06:38.020> training

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
just like with any other training

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.170 
just like with any other training
program<00:06:38.949> you<00:06:39.130> just<00:06:39.340> want<00:06:39.520> to<00:06:39.580> progressively

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
program you just want to progressively

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.719 
program you just want to progressively
build<00:06:40.690> your<00:06:41.020> recycling<00:06:41.590> fitness<00:06:42.069> over<00:06:42.490> time

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
build your recycling fitness over time

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.969 
build your recycling fitness over time
you<00:06:43.330> see<00:06:43.509> there's<00:06:43.690> no<00:06:43.750> real<00:06:44.139> shortcut<00:06:44.740> through

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
you see there's no real shortcut through

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.409 
you see there's no real shortcut through
