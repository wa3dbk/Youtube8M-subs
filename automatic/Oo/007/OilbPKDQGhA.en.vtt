 not only present cosmo today 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 clouds if they have names are too few 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.859
 It is it even has an explanation for it saw 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
 The day has already started almost cloudless by 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.210
 cause of the pre-frontal condition that the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.879
 condition precedent to the arrival of a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.489
 cold front one of the front pre 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.399
 cleaner in the sky along with the air mass 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 that predominates in the state causes all 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.460
 this heat and hinders the formation of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.699
 clouds othon then indicates that it is this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.850
 this few clouds means that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 A surgery is coming, but that is the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 title tomorrow

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 But today it's going to be very hot, let's go. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.939
 check temperatures 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.610

 degrees in the southern region the thermometers 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.299
 also range from 22 to 33 and in the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.200
 minimum of 18 and maximum of 28 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170

 It's going to get very hot and I want it today. 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 leave an alert here according to the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.860
 incaper meteorologists 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.860
 the ultraviolet radiation index today 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.049
 reaches extreme levels that 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.020
 been mostly at lunch time 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 between 11 o'clock in the morning and one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.750
 afternoon then you going to spend the day in 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 street or will be exposed under the sun more than 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 15 minutes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.079
 use and abuse the hat sunscreen and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.540
 even colored clothes because they 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.840
 help reduce the penetration of lightning 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.369
 on skin that can cause burns 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 accelerate the early aging of the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.960
 skin and increase the risk of developing 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.450
 skin cancer skin cancer 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.060
 since it is true there are other 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.980
 other other objectives other reasons 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 also to protect right 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.140
 yes you can protect yourself even more 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120
 these harmful rays to the skin beyond 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.260
 Colored clothes already exist 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.569
 solar protection 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.019
 after all you can not fool this summer is 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.440
 check the report 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.720
 Looking, you can not even see hats. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 shirts and dresses the face of the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.930
 summer 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.680
 but the fabric weave hides the secret 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.870
 of this technology are protective clothing 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.069
 at the beginning came with the objective of 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.440
 protect these people who really 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.959
 were more prone to skin cancer 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.640
 who had more sensitive skin but with 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.859
 over the years this technology has been 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.870
 evolving and today you have piece with 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.879
 that are beautiful that the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.349
 people use the beach and nobody has 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.410
 many times that it has 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.829
 sunscreen can be washed 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.870
 iron may normally be used 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.269
 to pass in case of parts that have 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.250
 this need carelessly ago 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.160
 about four years this technology 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.040
 reached the state and this summer is 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.430
 becoming fashionable the special fabrics have 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.069
 protection against ultraviolet rays and 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.079
 uv-b that can be harmful to the skin 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.209
 chemical component that exists in 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.829
 tissue is titanium dioxide which is a 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.329
 component of the physical sunscreen 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.799
 which are sunscreens that make 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.510
 barrier in the skin 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.760
 it is a product that does not cause allergy 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.919
 then there is no contraindication and the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.130
 consumers of clothes with 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:44.519
 sun protection is small for this 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.340
 t-shirts and more 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.250
 but adults also did not lag behind and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.829
 whoever wears feels the difference not only in 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.669
 protection but also in the quality of 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.989
 products 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.079
 I was interested in beauty. 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.780
 initially because of the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.609
 practicality and for being protection even 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.769
 cause of aging of the skin and 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.049
 clothes and accessories with sun protection 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.569
 guarantee practicality and comfort 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.980
 especially for those who practice 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.650
 outdoor sports 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.389
 but pay attention to other care 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.489
 are also needed 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.109
 some areas are still exposed then 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.870
 you have to protect the rest of the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.550
 hands to legs then area that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.110
 is protected with the shirt for example 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.880
 you have no obligation to 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.270
 low filter because the protection of the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.789
 boss 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.449
 but you have to protect the rest 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.629
 of the skin 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.389
 and then liked the idea then do as the 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:40.139
 silvana, who now looks stylish and 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.190
 protected and can enter this fashion without 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.750
 spend a lot 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.060
 we have a price variation with 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.789
 sure when you think of 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.250
 straw or Panama hat really. 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.250
 you have a higher cost but 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.520
 We also have T-shirts that have a 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.870
 costs are lower than 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.610
 from what value from $ 29 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.409
 clothes with sunscreen I did not know 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.750
 I found very interesting also to give 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.120
 stay beautiful and protected is cool like 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.349
 You already bought it and I loved it. 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.819
 our gallery a little hat I liked one 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.130
 lack of time to surf 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.569
 I only know that I 'm setting thank you. 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.569
 It happened to Germany tomorrow.
