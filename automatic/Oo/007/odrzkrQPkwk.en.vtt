00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.750
 what happens is that such then with a 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.700
 new video that I will ask the one that 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.620
 I was strauss minecraft if it's 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.570
 minecraft has received a mod because I 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.150
 I wanted to climb minecraft 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.190
 then let's start I'm golmud of 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.289
 lightsabers worth as clothe 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.779
 red swords pink swords of swords 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.980
 blue and green swords we are going to take 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:26.350
 one in this case the blue as you see is 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.670
 can save can be taken out 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.670
 it has its advantages 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.670
 If I go when it 's closed I can not 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.570
 jump four blocks nor four nor 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.690
 four nor 4 w that means like me with the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.270
 open sword I'll go to jumps four 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 blocks and we do not see damage by falls 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 same with the 45 blocks I do not hurt myself 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.100
 by falls in case I let go and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.489
 close the sword yes I hurt myself 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.489
 as you can see 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.809
 I hurt myself 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.290
 and the most you can take out jumping are 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.360
 four or five blocks is worth no longer 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.320
 you can take five blocks as you can 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.900
 see about sixty-five blocks 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.710
 what else if we give 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.990
 to the letter efe 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.080
 we plan and we get to reach a 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.300
 site further good lead me to the mobile 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.580
 forgive me forgive me and close tomorrow 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.000
 if we are going to center this as I said before 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.660
 we plan 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.920
 we plan letter f and we are planning and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.930
 we get further 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.930
 let's continue with the craft ers 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.430
 we are in these dyes 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 residuals we need crystal obsidian 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:07.770
 diamond and iron and dyes dye 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 purple red rose or lapis lazuli and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.200
 capture green tint if we put one of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.310
 obsidian down we surround them all of 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.880

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.120
 and while because the kids 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.239
 because first we have to do 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 that I was wrong to forgive me 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.950
 personally we have to do 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.859
 those who put a diamond down and in 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.870
 front up there is a member of the 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:45.620

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.130
 the green glass will give us the clean 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.460
 laser is worth and the same with all but 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.030
