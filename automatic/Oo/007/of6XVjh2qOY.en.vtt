so<00:02:59.260> definitely<00:02:59.709> mix<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.160> up<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.310> bit<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:01.060> it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
so definitely mix it up a bit I just it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.910 
so definitely mix it up a bit I just it
as<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.330> lens<00:03:01.660> at<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.900> top<00:03:02.079> so<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.769> actually

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
as a lens at the top so it actually

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.130 
as a lens at the top so it actually
bends<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> IR<00:03:03.760> track<00:03:04.060> beam<00:03:04.299> so<00:03:04.810> wherever<00:03:04.959> you

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
bends the IR track beam so wherever you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.630 
bends the IR track beam so wherever you
are<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.220> know<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.430> actually

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
are so you know you can actually

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.280 
are so you know you can actually
calibrate<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.420> also<00:03:07.690> enhance<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
calibrate and also enhance in the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.990 
calibrate and also enhance in the
distance<00:03:08.769> which<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.400> play<00:03:09.489> for<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.700> TV<00:03:09.850> i

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
distance which you can play for the TV i
