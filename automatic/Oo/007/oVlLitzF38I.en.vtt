vacuum sink them on the on the bike
here's<00:00:22.690> a<00:00:23.280> here's<00:00:24.280> the<00:00:24.430> way<00:00:24.520> I<00:00:24.550> do<00:00:24.730> it<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.180> take<00:00:26.080> a

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
here's a here's the way I do it I take a

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.689 
here's a here's the way I do it I take a
take<00:00:26.800> two<00:00:27.010> drill<00:00:27.279> bits<00:00:27.840> both<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:29.050> same<00:00:29.260> size

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
take two drill bits both the same size

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.130 
take two drill bits both the same size
put<00:00:30.699> one<00:00:30.880> drill<00:00:31.150> bit<00:00:31.300> in<00:00:31.420> your<00:00:31.570> base<00:00:31.779> carb

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
put one drill bit in your base carb

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.889 
put one drill bit in your base carb
which<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.770> this<00:00:32.980> case<00:00:33.190> it's<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.550> number<00:00:33.579> two

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
which in this case it's the number two

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.719 
which in this case it's the number two
this<00:00:34.899> is<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.109> engine<00:00:35.379> side<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:36.190> it's<00:00:36.340> one<00:00:36.519> two

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
this is the engine side so it's one two

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.229 
this is the engine side so it's one two
three<00:00:36.760> four<00:00:37.390> this<00:00:38.109> is<00:00:38.170> your<00:00:38.409> base<00:00:38.969> open<00:00:39.969> it<00:00:40.120> up

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
three four this is your base open it up

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.059 
three four this is your base open it up
and<00:00:40.420> put<00:00:41.019> the<00:00:41.050> drill<00:00:41.409> bit<00:00:41.589> underneath<00:00:41.920> the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
and put the drill bit underneath the

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.399 
and put the drill bit underneath the
throttle<00:00:42.550> blade<00:00:43.050> holding<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:45.899> throttle<00:00:46.899> open

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
throttle blade holding the throttle open

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.099 
throttle blade holding the throttle open
and<00:00:48.399> then<00:00:48.519> what<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.729> want<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:48.940> do<00:00:49.539> is<00:00:49.719> just<00:00:49.899> go

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
and then what you want to do is just go

and then what you want to do is just go
through<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.710> check<00:00:51.159> each<00:00:51.639> one<00:00:51.999> to<00:00:52.120> make<00:00:52.269> sure

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
through and check each one to make sure

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.619 
through and check each one to make sure
that<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:54.219> just<00:00:54.429> feel<00:00:54.579> a<00:00:54.609> slight<00:00:54.969> drag<00:00:55.359> of<00:00:55.569> the

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.079 
that you just feel a slight drag of the
drill<00:00:55.899> bit<00:00:55.929> and<00:00:56.350> this<00:00:56.769> one<00:00:56.979> here<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:57.399> not<00:00:57.609> open

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
drill bit and this one here is not open

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.229 
drill bit and this one here is not open
as<00:00:58.269> much<00:00:59.019> as<00:00:59.199> number<00:00:59.469> two<00:00:59.729> so<00:01:00.729> I'm<00:01:00.879> going<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.089> do

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
as much as number two so I'm going to do

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.699 
as much as number two so I'm going to do
is<00:01:01.389> I'm<00:01:01.539> just<00:01:01.569> going<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.899> adjust<00:01:01.959> the<00:01:02.409> sync

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:02.709 
is I'm just going to adjust the sync

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:08.100 
is I'm just going to adjust the sync
screw<00:01:03.399> here<00:01:06.119> try<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.150> get<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.630> open<00:01:07.690> up<00:01:08.020> a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
screw here try to get it to open up a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:22.000 
screw here try to get it to open up a
little<00:01:08.260> more

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:35.149 

all<00:01:23.010> right

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:59.950 

it's<00:01:36.159> pretty<00:01:36.369> close<00:01:36.549> there

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.899 

and<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.290> feels<00:02:01.470> good<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:05.580> definitely

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and that one feels good you definitely

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.580 
and that one feels good you definitely
want<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.180> three<00:02:06.600> before<00:02:06.780> four<00:02:07.259> because

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
want to do three before four because

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:32.500 
want to do three before four because
three<00:02:08.039> sinks<00:02:08.929> three<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.110> four<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> two

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.699 

all<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.959> hopefully<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.409> take<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
all right so hopefully when you take the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.490 
all right so hopefully when you take the
drill<00:02:34.950> bit<00:02:35.069> out<00:02:36.860> you'll<00:02:37.860> note<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:39.500> here

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
drill bit out you'll note that in here

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.430 
drill bit out you'll note that in here
there's<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.739> little<00:02:40.920> hole<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.519> pilot<00:02:42.440> I'll

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
there's a little hole for the pilot I'll

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.729 
there's a little hole for the pilot I'll
make<00:02:43.590> sure<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:44.840> they<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:45.989> look<00:02:46.200> roughly<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
make sure that they all look roughly the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.580 
make sure that they all look roughly the
same<00:02:48.349> and<00:02:50.269> they<00:02:51.269> do<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:51.750> I'm<00:02:52.260> going<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.440> throw

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
same and they do so I'm going to throw

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.309 
same and they do so I'm going to throw
these<00:02:52.709> carbs<00:02:53.040> back<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.959> vacuum<00:02:54.959> sync<00:02:55.200> them

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
these carbs back on and vacuum sync them

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.699 
these carbs back on and vacuum sync them
so<00:02:55.470> make<00:02:55.620> sure<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.920> check<00:02:56.069> out<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.280> video
