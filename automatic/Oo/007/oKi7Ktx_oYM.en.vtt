00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.639 
for a loop when I when I when I saw it
and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.689> put<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> cabinet<00:01:49.500> on

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and then when you put that cabinet on

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
and then when you put that cabinet on
and<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.520> thing<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.970> seals<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.509> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and think that thing just seals up so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.960 
and think that thing just seals up so
nice<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.259> tight<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.460> hole<00:01:53.700> that's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
nice and tight the only hole that's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
nice and tight the only hole that's
gonna<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.450> cabinet<00:01:54.930> where<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.259> drill

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
gonna be in this cabinet where you drill

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
gonna be in this cabinet where you drill
a<00:01:55.950> hole<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.790> electrical<00:01:57.299> through

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
a hole to put your electrical through

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.109 
a hole to put your electrical through
and<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.560> no<00:01:58.770> rodents<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.610> able<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and so no rodents will be able to get in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
and so no rodents will be able to get in
there<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> truly<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.860> best<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.189> both

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
there this is truly the best of both

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.850 
there this is truly the best of both
worlds<00:02:02.399> because<00:02:02.820> you've<00:02:03.719> got<00:02:03.960> great<00:02:04.380> great

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
worlds because you've got great great

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.889 
worlds because you've got great great
insulation<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.790> fact<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.420> say<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
insulation in fact I would say it's the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.680 
insulation in fact I would say it's the
best<00:02:07.020> insulated<00:02:07.829> spot<00:02:08.190> ever<00:02:08.550> seen<00:02:08.879> but

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
