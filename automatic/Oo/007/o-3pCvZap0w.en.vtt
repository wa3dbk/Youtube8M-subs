can't communicate that because I'm

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
can't communicate that because I'm
probably<00:00:58.470> feel<00:00:58.860> very<00:00:59.100> guilty<00:00:59.340> it's<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
probably feel very guilty it's that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
probably feel very guilty it's that
inability<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.260> communicate<00:01:01.470> that<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.190> some
