sit in there
and<00:02:27.770> you'll<00:02:28.310> hear<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.709> if<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.550> want<00:02:31.700> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and you'll hear it so and if you want to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.940 
and you'll hear it so and if you want to
double-check<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.360> again<00:02:32.870> when<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.410> when

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
double-check that again when you when

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.220 
double-check that again when you when
you<00:02:34.069> remove<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.640> disc<00:02:34.880> tray<00:02:35.300> just<00:02:35.569> give<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.140> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
you remove the disc tray just give it a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.260 
you remove the disc tray just give it a
shake<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.610> should<00:02:37.819> be<00:02:37.910> able<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.150> hear

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
shake and you should be able to hear

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.740 
shake and you should be able to hear
that<00:02:38.450> rattling<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:40.840> I'm<00:02:41.840> no<00:02:42.140> expert<00:02:42.410> in

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
that rattling so I'm no expert in

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.400 
that rattling so I'm no expert in
anything<00:02:44.750> computer<00:02:45.470> related<00:02:46.930> yeah<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.959> have<00:02:48.260> no

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
anything computer related yeah I have no

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.870 
anything computer related yeah I have no
idea<00:02:48.440> about<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.489> going<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
idea about that but I'm just going to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.210 
idea about that but I'm just going to
try<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.239> give<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.720> go<00:02:50.930> I'm<00:02:51.410> going<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.040> take

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
try and give this a go I'm going to take

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.020 
try and give this a go I'm going to take
some<00:02:52.459> hot<00:02:52.700> glue<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.440> I'm<00:02:54.440> going<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.910> try<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
some hot glue and I'm going to try and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.940 
some hot glue and I'm going to try and
glue<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.450> switch<00:02:56.870> back<00:02:57.170> into<00:02:57.380> place<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.860> was

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
glue this switch back into place I was

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.590 
glue this switch back into place I was
going<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.160> use<00:02:58.310> superglue<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> couldn't

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
going to use superglue but I couldn't

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.009 
going to use superglue but I couldn't
even<00:02:59.780> find<00:03:00.019> any<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.390> I'm<00:03:02.390> going<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.690> go<00:03:02.810> grab

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
even find any so I'm going to go grab

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.740 
even find any so I'm going to go grab
the<00:03:03.290> glue<00:03:03.500> gun<00:03:03.709> glue<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:04.190> up<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.640> see<00:03:05.480> how<00:03:05.630> it

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
the glue gun glue it up and see how it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.870 
the glue gun glue it up and see how it
looks<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:08.680> held<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.860> switch<00:03:10.190> from<00:03:10.370> there<00:03:10.670> with

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
looks I held the switch from there with

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.860 
looks I held the switch from there with
some<00:03:11.090> pliers<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.069> put<00:03:13.069> some<00:03:13.250> glue<00:03:13.430> down<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.150> I

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
some pliers and put some glue down and I

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.229 
some pliers and put some glue down and I
took<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.470> broken<00:03:15.950> piece<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.340> plastic<00:03:16.910> put<00:03:17.209> a

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
took the broken piece of plastic put a

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.090 
took the broken piece of plastic put a
little<00:03:17.540> bit<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.780> glue<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.080> bottom<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.650> it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
little bit of glue on the bottom of it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.850 
little bit of glue on the bottom of it
put<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:19.940> into<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.330> side<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:21.049> then<00:03:21.200> added<00:03:21.830> some

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
put it into the side and then added some

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.120 
put it into the side and then added some
glue<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.610> top<00:03:22.850> there<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.650> looks<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:24.799> the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
glue to the top there so looks like the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.600 
glue to the top there so looks like the
switch<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.700> place<00:03:26.150> pretty<00:03:26.660> good<00:03:26.780> and

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
switch is in place pretty good and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.520 
switch is in place pretty good and
hopefully<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.819> will<00:03:28.910> fix<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.390> problem<00:03:29.530> now

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
hopefully that will fix the problem now

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.840 
hopefully that will fix the problem now
I<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:30.650> need<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.980> put<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.250> back<00:03:31.370> together<00:03:31.579> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
I just need to put it back together and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.620 
I just need to put it back together and
find<00:03:32.030> out

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
find out

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.860 
find out
I<00:03:33.340> put<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.519> disc<00:03:34.760> drive<00:03:35.030> back<00:03:35.239> together<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
I put the disc drive back together and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.199 
I put the disc drive back together and
now<00:03:36.049> I'll<00:03:36.260> power<00:03:36.829> it<00:03:37.010> out<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.400> see<00:03:37.640> if<00:03:37.970> it's

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
now I'll power it out to see if it's

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:46.040 
now I'll power it out to see if it's
fixed<00:03:38.540> or<00:03:38.840> not

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:59.820 

it<00:03:46.740> seems<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.340> working

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:17.050 

maybe<00:04:00.790> not<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:02.770> guess

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.460 

it<00:04:17.690> seems<00:04:18.079> too<00:04:18.320> fixed<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.889> there<00:04:19.760> goes

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
it seems too fixed it there goes

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.590 
it seems too fixed it there goes
ordinarily<00:04:21.470> before<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.400> would<00:04:22.610> automatically

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
ordinarily before it would automatically

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.460 
ordinarily before it would automatically
go<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.320> come<00:04:24.530> back<00:04:24.560> out<00:04:27.490> all<00:04:28.490> right<00:04:29.470> well

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
go in and come back out all right well

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.580 
go in and come back out all right well
the<00:04:30.590> hot<00:04:30.740> glue<00:04:31.040> if<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.270> doesn't<00:04:33.050> hold<00:04:33.230> I'll

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
the hot glue if it doesn't hold I'll

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.680 
the hot glue if it doesn't hold I'll
make<00:04:33.830> an<00:04:33.950> update<00:04:34.340> video<00:04:34.550> or<00:04:35.090> post<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.600> the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
make an update video or post in the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.990 
make an update video or post in the
comments<00:04:36.290> but<00:04:36.610> seems<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.730> at<00:04:37.910> least

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
comments but seems to at least

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.230 
comments but seems to at least
temporarily<00:04:38.270> fix<00:04:38.990> it
