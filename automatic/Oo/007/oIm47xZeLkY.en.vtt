 forward 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.770
 why 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.380
 because he does not want 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.080
 good good afternoon thank you very much 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.290
 Well I am here as always

 just to welcome you to 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.270
 german pezzella 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.030
 a football player already wanted from the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.940
 beginning of this preseason whose 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.490
 management to bring it to Betis has been 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.380
 complex but we take for granted all 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 management difficulties as such 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.190
 have managed to bring here who 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.620
 we consider that it is going to be our 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.900
 central for many years 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.069
 my paper simply insisted was to give it 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.870
 the welcome that I give you here welcome 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.200

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.690
 successes 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.310
 and as technical questions you know 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.470
 perfectly that it dominates them much better 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.750
 Eduardo did not make me pass the word 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.640
 eduardo macía to describe what 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.970

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.970

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.400
 i 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.430

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.170

 said the president with germanic we started 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.280
 all the planning and almost almost almost 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.740
 it seemed like he spent the days he did not 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.100
 it arrived but good luckily it is 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.540

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.190
 administration by an effort that 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.800
 we are doing also I would like 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.500
 sleepless nights we've been like this 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.400
 to federico and adjustments is for the good has 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.870
 there were moments really hard moments 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.970
 of frustration and moments of joy 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.180
 goad some said the day he arrived and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.310
 the contract signed by river and 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.349
 good and also thank german 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.980
 how the pressure is held 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.890
 I really mean like a champion because 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.599
 I had shown many times what 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.930
 commented the quiet estate that you do not 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.629
 let's leave all that but with the 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.209
 fundamental piece in our project and 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.190
 I was calm that afternoon or 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.799
 early I would arrive at Betis as here 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.000
 been the president and eduardo by 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.970
 what 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.740
 the truth that as they had just been 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.220
 lived complicated situations as 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.550
 throughout this negotiation but always 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.320
 They were in contact with me to 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.500
 keep calm and know that in 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.390
 some time or another was going to happen and the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.110
 true that the interest they showed for 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.150
 me from the first moment I did not 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.900
 doubt a second of today to be 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.600
 here so the truth that the other day 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.640
 when we met we had agreed 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.120
 a hug when we get there 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.590
 after after several days of 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.960
 negotiation and wait so we could 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.030
 concretize and today I find myself very 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.380
 happy to be involved in the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.720
 project of this club 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.300
 he believed a lot in this project had 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.000
 many many desires and ambition to be able 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.480
 fulfill my goal that was today by 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 today to be here, so like 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.400
 I said earlier I'm happy and 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.580
 calm and good now the moment arrives 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.420
 for me to demonstrate the why of so many 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.580
 negotiations and so much waiting 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.260
 if eduardo from the first moment was 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.760
 clear with me what was what 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.460
 needed and so he had 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.630
 interested in me 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.259
 I think that as he spoke only in my 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.430
 put a little bit you need that 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.590
 personality and that ability to 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.930
 leadership because one from behind is the 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.060
 that has all the equipment in front and 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.230
 where can you orient your 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.380
 comrades by the positions of the field 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.150
 and then I have also spoken with 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.490
 companions who play with me in 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.760
 Argentina that have gone through the league 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.390
 Spanish has called me gabriel amato that 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.280
 I had him as a technician on the river and 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.310
 they gave the best references of the club 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.590
 of the city so as I said before 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.370
 from the first moment I decided to face 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.370
 this new challenge
