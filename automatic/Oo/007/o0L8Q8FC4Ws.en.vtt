00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
notice very carefully it says battery on

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.770 
notice very carefully it says battery on
the<00:01:20.490> bottom<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.180> needs<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.600> line

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the bottom this bit needs to be in line

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.219 
the bottom this bit needs to be in line
with<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> battery<00:01:22.320> contacts<00:01:22.740> along<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:24.229> get

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
with the battery contacts along here get

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
with the battery contacts along here get
your<00:01:25.350> battery<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> minute<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
your battery because in a minute you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.120 
your battery because in a minute you
need<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.880> apply<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.570> negative<00:01:27.990> contact<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
need to apply the negative contact to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.230 
need to apply the negative contact to
the<00:01:29.189> negative<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> positive<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the negative and the positive the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
the negative and the positive the
positive<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.290> make<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> mental<00:01:31.829> note<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.310> side

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
positive so make a mental note what side

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
positive so make a mental note what side
says<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.149> so<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.900> from<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.380> battery

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
says what so we know from this battery

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
says what so we know from this battery
that<00:01:35.010> this<00:01:35.159> side<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.460> negative<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.180> side

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that this side is negative and that side

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.080 
that this side is negative and that side
is<00:01:36.450> positive<00:01:39.530> grab<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.680> test<00:01:40.860> point<00:01:41.040> box<00:01:41.340> if

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is positive grab your test point box if

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.860 
is positive grab your test point box if
it<00:01:42.210> has<00:01:42.300> a<00:01:42.330> switch<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> switch<00:01:42.900> on<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:44.070> so

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
it has a switch to switch on then do so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.070 
it has a switch to switch on then do so
then<00:01:45.870> hook<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.830> negative<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.840> side

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
then hook your negative up to this side

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.450 
then hook your negative up to this side
which<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.530> negative<00:01:49.710> term<00:01:49.950> negative

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
which is your negative term negative

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.380 
which is your negative term negative
side<00:01:50.960> like<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.640> don't<00:01:53.640> click<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> positive

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
side like so don't click the positive

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.800 
side like so don't click the positive
just<00:01:54.600> yet<00:01:55.820> what<00:01:56.820> we're<00:01:56.940> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.120> do<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.630> we're
