Linda Kemp and I would like to share
with<00:00:20.560> you<00:00:20.770> some<00:00:21.100> ideas<00:00:21.700> that<00:00:21.730> have<00:00:22.210> helped<00:00:22.510> me

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
with you some ideas that have helped me

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:31.970 
with you some ideas that have helped me
to<00:00:23.230> simplify<00:00:23.830> painting<00:00:24.369> landscapes

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 

so<00:00:32.490> we're<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.640> filling<00:00:33.240> this<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.900> with

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so we're just filling this all in with

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.860 
so we're just filling this all in with
color<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> negative<00:00:35.220> space<00:00:35.870> around

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
color this is the negative space around

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.600 
color this is the negative space around
the<00:00:37.170> tree<00:00:38.390> let's<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> other<00:00:39.840> side<00:00:40.110> done

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.980 

now<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.030> switch<00:00:45.210> brushes<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.900> I'm

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
now I'm going to switch brushes and I'm

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.950 
now I'm going to switch brushes and I'm
picking<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.590> smaller<00:00:46.950> round<00:00:47.370> brush<00:00:47.790> I<00:00:48.120> want

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
picking up a smaller round brush I want

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.060 
picking up a smaller round brush I want
to<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.200> sure<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.680> too<00:00:49.890> much

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
to make sure you don't have too much

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
to make sure you don't have too much
water<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.300> same<00:00:51.540> mixture<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
water in it and the same mixture so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
water in it and the same mixture so
there's<00:00:52.890> my<00:00:53.130> shape<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's my shape now I'm going to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.870 
there's my shape now I'm going to
concentrate<00:00:54.900> on<00:00:55.320> cutting<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.700> my

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
concentrate on cutting into it so my

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:06.320 
concentrate on cutting into it so my
edge<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.200> I'm<00:00:58.350> thinking<00:00:58.800> about<00:01:05.119> there<00:01:06.119> we

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
edge is what I'm thinking about there we

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
edge is what I'm thinking about there we
go<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.259> shape<00:01:07.530> there's<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.190> edge

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
go so there's my shape there's the edge

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.120 
go so there's my shape there's the edge
painted<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> back<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
painted in now I'm going to go back and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.270 
painted in now I'm going to go back and
start<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:12.090> add<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.410> small<00:01:13.800> or<00:01:14.130> little

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
start to add some of the small or little

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.790 
start to add some of the small or little
cut<00:01:14.670> marks<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.300> there<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.660> you<00:01:15.840> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
cut marks in there if you want to do a

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.760 
cut marks in there if you want to do a
lot<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.720> realistic<00:01:19.170> looking

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
lot of a little more realistic looking

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.680 
lot of a little more realistic looking
tree<00:01:20.190> then<00:01:20.610> you're<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.000> add<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
tree then you're going to add more and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.960 
tree then you're going to add more and
more<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.970> smaller<00:01:24.330> marks

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:39.470 

now<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.149> just<00:01:30.420> continue<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> cut<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.030 

I'm<00:01:40.050> working<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.800> dry<00:01:41.220> paper<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.620> want

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I'm working on dry paper because I want

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700 
I'm working on dry paper because I want
control<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:45.000> these<00:01:45.600> edges<00:01:46.050> I<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.410> tight

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
control of these edges I want tight

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.830 
control of these edges I want tight
edges<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> edges<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.330> shape<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
edges it's the edges and the shape that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
edges it's the edges and the shape that
tell<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.230> story<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.830> you're<00:01:49.950> working<00:01:50.400> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
tell the story when you're working in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.080 
tell the story when you're working in
the<00:01:50.640> negative<00:01:51.120> okay<00:01:52.050> there<00:01:52.260> we<00:01:52.410> go<00:01:52.530> now

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
the negative okay there we go now

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
the negative okay there we go now
captured<00:01:54.200> inside<00:01:55.200> negatives<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
captured inside negatives so if the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.020 
captured inside negatives so if the
trunk<00:01:57.150> passes<00:01:57.870> up<00:01:58.080> from<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.800> base<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
trunk passes up from the base up to the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.400 
trunk passes up from the base up to the
top<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.600> need<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> visualize<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:02.100> solid<00:02:03.410> form

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
top I need to visualize a solid form

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.010 
top I need to visualize a solid form
working<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.400> there<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.910> so<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.600> will<00:02:06.780> give

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
working up there and so that will give

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.650 
working up there and so that will give
me<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.290> idea<00:02:07.410> of<00:02:07.860> where<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.610> place<00:02:08.970> these

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
me an idea of where to place these

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
me an idea of where to place these
little<00:02:10.110> captured<00:02:10.619> negatives<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.190> pop<00:02:11.550> in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
little captured negatives that pop in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.830 
little captured negatives that pop in
the<00:02:11.880> little<00:02:12.120> holes<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.990> so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.920 

cover<00:02:21.440> up<00:02:21.680> your<00:02:21.709> water<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.819> then<00:02:23.630> we're<00:02:23.840> gonna

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
cover up your water and then we're gonna

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
cover up your water and then we're gonna
get<00:02:24.170> into<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.530> Badger<00:02:24.740> brush<00:02:25.100> it's<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.430> dry

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
get into the Badger brush it's a dry

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.880 
get into the Badger brush it's a dry
brush<00:02:25.970> no<00:02:26.540> dunking<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.380> water<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
brush no dunking it in the water and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.400 
brush no dunking it in the water and
we're<00:02:28.670> going<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.940> pick<00:02:29.330> up<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.780> little<00:02:30.110> bit<00:02:30.290> of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
we're going to pick up a little bit of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.550 
we're going to pick up a little bit of
color<00:02:30.709> let's<00:02:31.670> just<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:33.050> little

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
color let's just do this here a little

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.750 
color let's just do this here a little
bit<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:34.090> I'm<00:02:35.090> gonna<00:02:35.209> take<00:02:35.510> some<00:02:35.810> blue<00:02:36.200> now<00:02:36.980> one

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
bit of I'm gonna take some blue now one

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.010 
bit of I'm gonna take some blue now one
of<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.270> first<00:02:38.480> thing<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> would

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
of the the first thing that I would

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.160 
of the the first thing that I would
suggest<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.340> when<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.120> take<00:02:41.360> one<00:02:41.840> color

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
suggest is that when you take one color

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.830 
suggest is that when you take one color
choose<00:02:42.709> something<00:02:43.340> quite<00:02:43.850> different<00:02:44.150> so

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
choose something quite different so

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.470 
choose something quite different so
rather<00:02:45.200> than<00:02:45.530> taking<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.430> cerulean<00:02:47.180> blue

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
rather than taking this a cerulean blue

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.600 
rather than taking this a cerulean blue
and<00:02:47.750> cobalt<00:02:48.350> blue<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.370> slightly

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
and cobalt blue just a little slightly

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.900 
and cobalt blue just a little slightly
different<00:02:50.090> value<00:02:50.510> we<00:02:50.959> want<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.530> shift<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.700> hue

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
different value we want to shift the hue

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.060 
different value we want to shift the hue
so<00:02:53.540> we're<00:02:54.019> going<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.290> take<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> little<00:02:54.769> bit<00:02:54.920> of

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
so we're going to take a little bit of

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.160 
so we're going to take a little bit of
blue<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.850> let's<00:02:56.209> take<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> little<00:02:56.810> bit<00:02:56.989> of

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
blue and let's take a little bit of

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.090 
blue and let's take a little bit of
violet<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.950> I've<00:02:58.489> got<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.200> I've<00:03:00.320> got<00:03:00.500> violet

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
violet and I've got so I've got violet

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.759 
violet and I've got so I've got violet
on<00:03:01.250> violet<00:03:01.850> on<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.630> side<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.320> blue<00:03:03.560> on

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
on violet on this side and the blue on

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.460 
on violet on this side and the blue on
this<00:03:04.010> side<00:03:04.310> now<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.180> pressing<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.050> together

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
this side now I'm pressing it together

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.030 
this side now I'm pressing it together
if<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.670> automatically<00:03:08.560> dunk<00:03:09.560> from<00:03:09.769> this

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
if you just automatically dunk from this

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.220 
if you just automatically dunk from this
side<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.580> side<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.120> go<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.989> paper

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
side to this side and go on to the paper

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.790 
side to this side and go on to the paper
you<00:03:12.890> end<00:03:13.160> up<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.610> something<00:03:14.300> really<00:03:14.780> hard<00:03:15.140> so

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
you end up with something really hard so

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.690 
you end up with something really hard so
we<00:03:16.069> want<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.580> make<00:03:16.760> sure<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:18.400> mash<00:03:19.400> these

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
we want to make sure that you mash these

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.650 
we want to make sure that you mash these
colors<00:03:20.180> together<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.690> little<00:03:20.959> bit<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.330> the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
colors together a little bit so that the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.420 
colors together a little bit so that the
stroke<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> little<00:03:24.530> more<00:03:24.650> subtle<00:03:24.920> we've<00:03:25.190> got

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
stroke is a little more subtle we've got

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.940 
stroke is a little more subtle we've got
some<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> blue<00:03:26.480> some<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.380> violet<00:03:27.829> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
some of the blue some of the violet and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.370 
some of the blue some of the violet and
in<00:03:28.160> between<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> nice<00:03:29.090> transition<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
in between is a nice transition the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.060 
in between is a nice transition the
brushstroke<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.370> down<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.299> use<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:33.500> flat

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
brushstroke is down and I use the flat

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.539 
brushstroke is down and I use the flat
of<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.880> brush<00:03:35.180> not<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:37.100> edge<00:03:38.769> it's<00:03:39.769> flat

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
of the brush not this edge it's flat

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:48.759 
of the brush not this edge it's flat
brush<00:03:40.940> going<00:03:41.269> down<00:03:42.579> like<00:03:43.579> so<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.709> make<00:03:47.769> make

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
brush going down like so and I make make

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.259 
brush going down like so and I make make
it<00:03:48.799> my<00:03:49.100> purpose<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:51.100> brush<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.790> brush<00:03:53.000> stroke

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
it my purpose to brush the brush stroke

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.229 
it my purpose to brush the brush stroke
comes<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:53.870> start<00:03:54.859> at<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.190> right<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.730> sweep

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
comes down start at the right and sweep

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.590 
comes down start at the right and sweep
to<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.600> left<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.620> will<00:03:58.000> pull<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.209> brush

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
to the left and I will pull this brush

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.340 
to the left and I will pull this brush
across<00:03:59.959> for<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.920> little<00:04:01.609> while<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.180> then<00:04:03.019> I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
across for a little while and then I

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.680 
across for a little while and then I
turn<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.400> work<00:04:04.670> from<00:04:05.030> another<00:04:05.180> direction

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
turn and I work from another direction

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.680 
turn and I work from another direction
and<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.950> gives<00:04:07.190> me<00:04:07.400> this<00:04:07.549> nice<00:04:07.820> tossing

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
and that gives me this nice tossing

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.210 
and that gives me this nice tossing
grass<00:04:09.019> sort<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.250> feeling<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.299> it<00:04:12.190> even<00:04:13.190> just

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
grass sort of a feeling to it even just

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.310 
grass sort of a feeling to it even just
the<00:04:13.519> moisture<00:04:14.030> on<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.359> paper<00:04:14.600> with<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.079> dirty

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
the moisture on the paper with the dirty

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:26.730 
the moisture on the paper with the dirty
brush<00:04:15.650> gives<00:04:16.220> us<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.489> really<00:04:16.700> pretty<00:04:17.090> effect

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.210 

let's<00:04:27.340> bring<00:04:27.789> just<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.900> few<00:04:29.289> little<00:04:29.500> captured

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
let's bring just a few little captured

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.909 
let's bring just a few little captured
negatives<00:04:30.840> just<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.320> spaces<00:04:32.889> between

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
negatives just like the spaces between

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.390 
negatives just like the spaces between
the<00:04:33.520> trees<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.330> between<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.960> branches

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
the trees and the between the branches

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.219 
the trees and the between the branches
into<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.580> area<00:04:37.830> typically<00:04:38.830> what<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.190> would<00:04:40.229> be

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
into this area typically what I would be

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.170 
into this area typically what I would be
thinking<00:04:41.650> about<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.550> color<00:04:42.850> that's

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
thinking about is the color that's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.890 
thinking about is the color that's
behind<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:44.320> large<00:04:44.970> bank<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.270> trees<00:04:46.630> that's

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
behind this large bank of trees that's

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.080 
behind this large bank of trees that's
the<00:04:47.080> color<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.620> you'd<00:04:47.830> see<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.250> behind<00:04:48.820> it

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
the color that you'd see and behind it

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.439 
the color that you'd see and behind it
that<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:50.620> going<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:50.979> look<00:04:51.130> really<00:04:51.190> bold<00:04:52.090> and

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
that is going to look really bold and

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.170 
that is going to look really bold and
I'm<00:04:52.690> not<00:04:53.110> sure<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.710> that's<00:04:54.430> where<00:04:54.759> I<00:04:54.789> want<00:04:55.090> to

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
I'm not sure that that's where I want to

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.529 
I'm not sure that that's where I want to
be<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.720> let's<00:04:55.990> put<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.410> in<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:57.240> then<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.270> can

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
be so let's put it in and then I can

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.290 
be so let's put it in and then I can
always<00:04:58.720> change<00:04:59.169> my<00:04:59.229> mind<00:04:59.800> afterwards<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:01.000> is

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
always change my mind afterwards this is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.100 
always change my mind afterwards this is
still<00:05:02.259> damp

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
still damp

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.379 
still damp
now<00:05:05.110> just<00:05:05.680> as<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.370> transparent<00:05:07.150> color

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
now just as it is that transparent color

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.779 
now just as it is that transparent color
on<00:05:07.840> top<00:05:08.169> of<00:05:08.289> that<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.620> doesn't<00:05:08.800> look<00:05:09.400> like<00:05:09.580> much

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
on top of that it doesn't look like much

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.080 
on top of that it doesn't look like much
it<00:05:10.000> doesn't<00:05:10.180> show<00:05:10.479> up<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:11.259> we<00:05:11.500> need<00:05:11.889> to<00:05:12.430> add<00:05:12.759> an

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
it doesn't show up so we need to add an

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.839 
it doesn't show up so we need to add an
opaque<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.930> can<00:05:14.050> add<00:05:14.199> any<00:05:14.470> opaque<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.820> a

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
opaque to it you can add any opaque to a

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:24.770 
opaque to it you can add any opaque to a
color<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.449> will<00:05:16.570> become<00:05:16.990> an<00:05:17.229> opaque
