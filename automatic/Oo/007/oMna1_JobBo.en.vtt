00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
gives it a more stable platform and when

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.070 
gives it a more stable platform and when
you're<00:01:21.650> attaching<00:01:21.950> your<00:01:22.220> sling<00:01:22.550> in<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:23.750> runs

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080

off the side in a natural manner instead

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.180 
off the side in a natural manner instead
of<00:01:26.180> underneath<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.080> existing<00:01:27.590> quad<00:01:27.830> sling

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
of underneath as the existing quad sling

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.330 
of underneath as the existing quad sling
or<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.729> TAC<00:01:28.940> one<00:01:29.270> -<00:01:29.720> had<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> plastic<00:01:30.380> d-ring

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
or the TAC one - had a plastic d-ring

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.510 
or the TAC one - had a plastic d-ring
underneath<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:32.420> sling<00:01:32.720> has<00:01:33.200> more<00:01:33.530> with<00:01:34.400> the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
underneath this sling has more with the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.100 
underneath this sling has more with the
deep<00:01:34.700> with<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> metal<00:01:35.450> snap<00:01:35.690> hook<00:01:35.870> in<00:01:35.990> there

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
deep with the metal snap hook in there

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.050 
deep with the metal snap hook in there
creates<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.530> more<00:01:36.920> stable<00:01:37.190> platform<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.880> runs

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
creates a more stable platform that runs

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060 
creates a more stable platform that runs
off<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.479> side<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:38.930> now<00:01:39.080> my<00:01:39.260> transitions<00:01:39.950> are

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
off the side so now my transitions are

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.090 
off the side so now my transitions are
faster<00:01:40.549> going<00:01:41.330> back<00:01:41.659> from<00:01:41.870> two<00:01:42.049> points<00:01:42.560> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
faster going back from two points and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.250 
faster going back from two points and
locking<00:01:43.549> in<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.909> can<00:01:44.180> simply<00:01:44.630> slam<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.080> down<00:01:45.110> on

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
locking in I can simply slam it down on

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.219 
locking in I can simply slam it down on
