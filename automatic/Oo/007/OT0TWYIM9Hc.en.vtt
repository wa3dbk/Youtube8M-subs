feed the chips into the boil

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.830 
feed the chips into the boil
when<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.620> chip<00:01:41.770> arrives<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:43.060> will<00:01:43.300> be<00:01:43.450> dumped

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
when the chip arrives it will be dumped

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.330 
when the chip arrives it will be dumped
on<00:01:43.960> top<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:45.360> sweepin<00:01:46.360> order<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.920> normally

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
on top of a sweepin order so normally

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.610 
on top of a sweepin order so normally
this<00:01:48.490> wouldn't<00:01:48.730> be<00:01:48.940> visible<00:01:49.060> but<00:01:50.020> as<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.410> is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
this wouldn't be visible but as this is

this wouldn't be visible but as this is
almost<00:01:51.250> empty<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.870> see<00:01:53.230> how<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:54.730> sweeper

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
almost empty you can see how the sweeper

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.890 
almost empty you can see how the sweeper
arms<00:01:55.600> pull<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:57.370> chip<00:01:57.640> into<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.300> order<00:01:58.690> and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
arms pull the chip into the order and

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.440 
arms pull the chip into the order and
then<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.530> order<00:01:59.790> transfers<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.240> chip

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
then the order transfers the chip

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.960 
then the order transfers the chip
