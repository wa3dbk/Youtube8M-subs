 pitched and rap for the 3ds where according to 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.190
 dress they would bring nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.710
 that 17 alien forms available 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.720

 another interesting thing will be that at 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.780

 playable for all consoles as well 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.010
 what blogs the most innovative of this game 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.450
 it comes to be the sequence against the clock 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.310
 in which you apparently have the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.890
 possibility of having 4 aliens to your 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.870
 disposition or three to circumvent certain 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.140
 obstacles in a kind of racing 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.790
 to catch something for this every 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.920
 characteristic of the agents will serve 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.040
 a lot has also been said that the aliens 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.930
 they will be separated by different types 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 speed strength agility to be able 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.090
 choose the one that best suits you 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.190
 suits you best 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.870
 some curiosities that we have for 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.550
 this video game that we can highlight is 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.599
 that universe in the second series of 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.610
 ben10 in which a 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.290
 video game that focuses on its plot the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.200
 first being alien ports with someone 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 for being videogame and library tax 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.739
 ultimate alien does not count because 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.599
 it only has two distortion me since 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.940
 galactic rising is not based on the plot 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.500
 exactly other curiosities with this 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.030
 videogame we have several years already 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.129
 they repeat their dish appearing in the biggest 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.450
 Ben10 video game quantity four

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 followed by xlr8 and cannonball that have 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.410
 appeared in 3 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.050
 now there have been seven video games must 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.420

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.209
 operate our expectations and in addition to 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.280
 nothing transport us again to have the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.920
 from our power will be necessary
