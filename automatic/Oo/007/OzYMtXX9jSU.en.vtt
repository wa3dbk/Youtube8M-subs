such great right well if you've got a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.240 
such great right well if you've got a
dual<00:00:18.900> humbucker<00:00:19.680> guitar<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:20.970> Les<00:00:21.480> Paul

Smith any number of guitars if but if
it's<00:00:30.720> dual<00:00:31.019> humbuckers<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.980> they're<00:00:32.700> wired

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it's dual humbuckers and they're wired

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.690 
it's dual humbuckers and they're wired
so<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> pickups<00:00:34.739> interact<00:00:35.309> together

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so that the pickups interact together

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.560 
so that the pickups interact together
you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.899> leverage<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> pickup<00:00:38.820> selector<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you can leverage the pickup selector and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.780 
you can leverage the pickup selector and
the<00:00:40.170> volume<00:00:40.500> control<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.460> create

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the volume control to actually create

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.410

quick let me just show you how to do

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.630 
quick let me just show you how to do
this<00:00:46.649> first<00:00:47.100> you'll<00:00:47.280> want<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.579> your

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
this first you'll want to take your

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
this first you'll want to take your
pickup<00:00:48.059> selector<00:00:48.210> switch<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.079> put<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
pickup selector switch and put it in the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.700 
pickup selector switch and put it in the
middle<00:00:50.280> position<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.570> both<00:00:51.899> pickups<00:00:52.199> are

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
middle position so that both pickups are

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
middle position so that both pickups are
activated<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.239> next<00:00:54.480> thing<00:00:54.629> you'll<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

whatever else you need to wherever you
like<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.570> turn<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.979> neck<00:01:05.369> let<00:01:05.909> me

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
like it but then turn the neck let me

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.050 
like it but then turn the neck let me
hold<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.750> turn<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.890> neck<00:01:08.340> pick<00:01:08.880> up

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
hold this up here turn the neck pick up

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.840 
hold this up here turn the neck pick up
volume<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> way<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
volume all the way down and if it's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.999 
volume all the way down and if it's
wired<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.570> Les<00:01:12.810> Paul<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:13.770> find

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
wired like this Les Paul you will find

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.010 
wired like this Les Paul you will find
that<00:01:17.009> even<00:01:17.460> though<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.060> pickup<00:01:18.360> selector<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that even though the pickup selector is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.280 
that even though the pickup selector is
in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> middle<00:01:19.830> position<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.290> very

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
in the middle position you will get very

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.310 
in the middle position you will get very
little<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:23.130> volume<00:01:23.720> out<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.020> guitar

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.050 

the<00:01:28.320> reason<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the reason for this is because the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.060 
the reason for this is because the
circuitry<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> wiring<00:01:31.850> has<00:01:32.850> really

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
circuitry the wiring has really

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.230 
circuitry the wiring has really
connections<00:01:35.070> between<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.670> two<00:01:35.820> pickups

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
connections between the two pickups

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.749 
connections between the two pickups
sorry<00:01:37.110> I'll<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.610> can

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
sorry I'll have to if I can if I can

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
sorry I'll have to if I can if I can
find<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> I'll<00:01:39.420> put<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> link<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> schematic

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
find it I'll put a link to the schematic

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
find it I'll put a link to the schematic
in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.369> video<00:01:41.610> notes<00:01:41.850> below<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
in the video notes below just so you can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.359 
in the video notes below just so you can
kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
kind of see that but one of the and a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
kind of see that but one of the and a
lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> people<00:01:48.000> view<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> negative

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
lot of people view that as a negative

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
lot of people view that as a negative
because<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.070> pickups<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.729> totally

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
because the pickups are not totally

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
because the pickups are not totally
independent<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.810> each<00:01:51.869> other<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
independent of each other but it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 
independent of each other but it
actually<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.670> positive<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> comes

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
actually can be a positive when it comes

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.840 
actually can be a positive when it comes
to<00:01:55.380> volume<00:01:55.710> swells<00:01:55.969> because<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.659> occur

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
to volume swells because what will occur

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.380 
to volume swells because what will occur
with<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.000> guitar<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.130> neck<00:02:03.119> pickup

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
with this guitar is if the neck pickup

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.389 
with this guitar is if the neck pickup
is<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.770> bring<00:02:05.219> up

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
is all the way down and I just bring up

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.999 
is all the way down and I just bring up
the<00:02:05.610> volume<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.619> bridge

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the volume a little bit the bridge

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.449 
the volume a little bit the bridge
pickup<00:02:08.340> turns<00:02:09.030> full<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:11.069> gives<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
pickup turns full on and it gives you a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.580 
pickup turns full on and it gives you a
really<00:02:11.910> cool<00:02:12.120> trumpets<00:02:12.780> well<00:02:12.989> let<00:02:13.319> me<00:02:13.379> show
