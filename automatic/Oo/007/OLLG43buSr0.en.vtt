00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.820
 the side of youtube show you more 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.260
 a video the hill climb racing this time 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.519
 I will change the vehicle I was always 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.920
 using for the monster truck let's 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.630
 use the tractor if the link also has 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.890
 some trees in his drawing are not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.900
 precisely because the on the forest ranch 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.600
 these trees ready to go over 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.949
 and the tractor is a good option to do this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.750
 phase to try to go the farthest 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.359
 possible at this stage the first attempt 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 get a good shake here and throw a weight 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.109
 of the tractor against the trees or 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 was trying to do this phase with a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.420
 truck a monster and tals but no 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:44.820
 It was so easy, it does not make a good 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 our company in the area will finish the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.920
 fuel a bug in the game that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 happened it got stuck on the bottom 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 from the first half that thug the game has 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.890
 a high weight then throwing his weight 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 with a good speed above the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 trees you will get 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
 is going over them or at least 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.200
 most of them do not have large 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.430
 rises here in the game then knows the tractor 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.299
 there is also no vehicle that is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.310
 so fast 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.220
 in caracas the animal does not get stuck in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.470
 new 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 Come on, it's good, it 's a phase that is not 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.070
 It's so fun that you 're not playing. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.810
 can make high speeds in it 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.049
 You can not maneuver or 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.729
 nothing but a different phase and it is well 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.970
 difficult are already seeing me right 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 It's not easy to get the car showed then 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.090
 who knows a monster car or a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.470
 little more accustomed because the game is in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.470
 most of the other phases with him 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.240
 was with him that is recommended for her 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:02:00.689
 do what appears in the phase thumbnail 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:02.399
 of the tractor at least here but also 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.810
 the car is improving the maximum 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.060
 As you already know at most the tractor it 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.690
 I only improved two or three times each 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.069
 item 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.940
 So who knows, the tractor is like this? 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.280
 better go ahead 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.560
 comment this because I'm new too 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.120
 in the club and always playing here with you 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.310
 Of course, a game that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.590
 videos but ended up dying 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.180
 but I do not know is at least what I 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.770
 I think it 's your best tractor because 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.900
 How was I in the miniature of you? 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.070
 in the tractor it appears it passing over 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.170
 of the trees, right? 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.700
 with respect to the complaint to the ground is well 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 Calm down, this is good. 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.630
 what complicates the same phase are these 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 trees up mountains does not have large 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.310
 mountains where at least at the beginning and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.750
 that makes it difficult for these trees 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.790
 lines these pine trees there the people 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.380
 is going over and it is well 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.210
 complicated for the turns what is a 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.250
 very easy vehicle is very important and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.660
 it is with good speed to go over 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.280
 of them finishing video for here task 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.980
 show from the forest farm to 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.660
 Do you guys from the river clear if this phase is good? 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.820
 complicated very difficult very intense than 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 I thought the tractor was good but not 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.220
 wanted to comment and tell me do you think 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.380
 that I 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.730
 the stage is the best vehicle for this 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.860
 page because I thought it was not the tractor 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.740
 is I think I thinking that the car 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.160
 monster right here that does not have 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.750
 demonstrated in the miniature of his 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.280
 vehicle is no longer the monster car is 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.140
 giving the message here to destroy 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.930
 the weapons and is going from a rise 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 more difficult is complicated but that's it 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.650
 guys, I had it for you guys this 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.670
 and evaluate the video if possible 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.920
 It's not like we said it is. 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.970
 there in the series, this is a hug to everyone and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.970
 Until the next video I went
