today<00:00:04.680> we're<00:00:04.859> taking<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.190> look<00:00:05.220> at<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.520> speed

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
today we're taking a look at a speed

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.930 
today we're taking a look at a speed
test<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.779> cricket<00:00:07.259> broadband<00:00:07.820> here<00:00:08.820> in

san diego we're at balboa park in san

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.459 
san diego we're at balboa park in san
diego<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.000> we're<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.929> test<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.440> see

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
diego and we're going to test and see

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
diego and we're going to test and see
what<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> speeds<00:00:14.400> are<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
what the speeds are like here in the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
what the speeds are like here in the
middle<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> park<00:00:16.160> so<00:00:17.160> i'm<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
middle of the park so i'm going to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.010 
middle of the park so i'm going to
connect<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> go<00:00:18.750> through<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
connect it's going to go through the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720 
connect it's going to go through the
connect<00:00:19.380> sequence<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.220> after<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
connect sequence and then after it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.910 
connect sequence and then after it
connects<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.510> load<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.080> speedtest.net

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
connects we will load up speedtest.net

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.929 
connects we will load up speedtest.net
and<00:00:23.840> see<00:00:24.840> exactly<00:00:24.990> how<00:00:25.859> fast<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.490> speeds<00:00:26.609> are

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
and see exactly how fast the speeds are

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.859 
and see exactly how fast the speeds are
in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> middle<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> park<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.570> it's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
in the middle of the park here so it's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
in the middle of the park here so it's
connecting<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.679> already<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.790> speed<00:00:33.059> test

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
connecting i already have the speed test

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.400 
connecting i already have the speed test
loaded<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:35.090> I'm<00:00:36.090> sorry<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.639 

speed<00:00:43.410> test<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.890> loading<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:45.440> beginning<00:00:46.440> the

speed test is loading up beginning the
test<00:00:47.450> it's<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.809> test<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.770> how<00:00:49.890> fast

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
test it's going to test just how fast

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.680 
test it's going to test just how fast
speeds<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.559> Wichita<00:00:53.160> Kansas

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
speeds are from here to Wichita Kansas

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
speeds are from here to Wichita Kansas
it's<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> misrepresentation<00:00:55.860> because

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it's kind of a misrepresentation because

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
it's kind of a misrepresentation because
i'm<00:00:57.059> actually<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.510> san<00:00:57.719> diego<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
i'm actually in san diego not the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.060 
i'm actually in san diego not the
Midwest<00:00:59.960> but<00:01:00.960> we'll<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.649> comes<00:01:01.920> up

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Midwest but we'll see what it comes up

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
Midwest but we'll see what it comes up
with<00:01:02.280> anyways<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.300> we'll<00:01:03.449> try<00:01:03.600> another

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
with anyways and then we'll try another

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.760 
with anyways and then we'll try another
server<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.450> it's

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
server so right now you can see it's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
server so right now you can see it's
testing<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> download<00:01:08.390> looks<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.570> about<00:01:09.720> an

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
testing the download looks like about an

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.060 
testing the download looks like about an
average<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.939> half<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.330> megabit<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.070> then

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
average of about half a megabit and then

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.249 
average of about half a megabit and then
it's<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.520> test<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> upload<00:01:15.390> speed

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.359 

which<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.470> usually<00:01:20.220> traditionally<00:01:20.939> slower

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
which is usually traditionally slower

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.510 
which is usually traditionally slower
looks<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.880> Oh<00:01:24.360> point<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.200> point<00:01:25.680> 2

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
looks like about Oh point one point 2

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.440 
looks like about Oh point one point 2
megabits<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:28.400> looks<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.520> an<00:01:29.759> oval<00:01:30.240> park

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
megabits so looks like an oval park

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
megabits so looks like an oval park
we're<00:01:30.659> getting<00:01:30.869> about<00:01:31.110> half<00:01:31.380> megabit

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
we're getting about half megabit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.969 
we're getting about half megabit
download<00:01:32.159> speed<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> half<00:01:33.630> megabit<00:01:34.290> or

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
download speed and half megabit or

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.660 
download speed and half megabit or
point2<00:01:35.939> megabit<00:01:36.360> upload<00:01:36.840> speed<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.159> let's<00:01:38.369> try

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
point2 megabit upload speed so let's try

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.679 
point2 megabit upload speed so let's try
again<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> new<00:01:39.750> server<00:01:41.360> it's<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> let

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
again on a new server it's going to let

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
again on a new server it's going to let
me<00:01:42.869> pick<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.439> we'll<00:01:43.590> try<00:01:43.860> San<00:01:44.159> Diego<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.759> time

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
me pick so we'll try San Diego this time

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.039 
me pick so we'll try San Diego this time
so<00:01:45.329> that's<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.659> I'm<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:50.630> some<00:01:51.630> reason<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
so that's where I'm at some reason it

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
so that's where I'm at some reason it
thinks<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> Midwest<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.310> assume

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
thinks I'm in the Midwest I assume

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
thinks I'm in the Midwest I assume
that's<00:01:53.880> where<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> modems<00:01:55.079> IP<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.799> routing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that's where the modems IP is routing

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.990 
that's where the modems IP is routing
through<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.680> preparing<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> download

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
through so it's preparing the download

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.969 
through so it's preparing the download
looks<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.320> getting<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:01.799> bit

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
looks like it's getting a little bit

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.670 
looks like it's getting a little bit
faster<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> download<00:02:03.509> speed<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
faster of a download speed here this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.199 
faster of a download speed here this
time<00:02:06.350> point<00:02:07.350> 6<00:02:07.710> megabits<00:02:08.340> per<00:02:08.429> second<00:02:08.910> when

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
time point 6 megabits per second when

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.660 
time point 6 megabits per second when
tested<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> san<00:02:09.959> diego<00:02:09.989> server<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
tested with the san diego server and the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
tested with the san diego server and the
upload<00:02:12.090> speed<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
upload speed is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
upload speed is
going<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.040> about<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:15.300> bit<00:02:15.480> higher

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
going to be about a little bit higher

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.030 
going to be about a little bit higher
point<00:02:16.080> 26<00:02:16.680> megabit<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.350> it's<00:02:19.350> about<00:02:19.470> average

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
point 26 megabit so it's about average

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.390 
point 26 megabit so it's about average
for<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.370> wireless<00:02:21.030> broadband<00:02:22.100> connection<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
for a wireless broadband connection and
