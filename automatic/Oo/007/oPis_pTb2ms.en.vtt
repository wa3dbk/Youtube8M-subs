00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:14.110
 oliver finch from janitor comes 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.529
 over is over 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.630
 then he got the eleven meter out completely 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.850
 very strong 1 line from maximilian 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 Beister 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 and very badly defended 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.720
 fall 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.700
 arne feick, he has to stay away 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 if he stays away at 16 o'clock 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.610
 to the kemper must be as one with his now 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.610
 23 years 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.470
 28 minute eleven meter fortuna düsseldorf 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.920
 he can shoot no more corners 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:01.769
 penalty shoot so the routiniers im 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.769
 direct duel sascha rösler 33 35 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.660
 sascha rösler wants to shoot because of the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.630
 actually as a shooter because düsseldorf 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.500
 is the long corner so rösler what 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 make of it does the individual help before 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 all things the düsseldorfer have here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.760
 to convince therefore has 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.010
 norbert meier also did not change 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.860
 send the same elf out again 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.560
 the lawn is not pure mason either 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 probably changed 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.050
 rather out of necessity born in vienna 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.650
 provide from his bank who could 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.869
 There really help from these many 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.160
 Great talents no question 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.570
 hopeful junior players but in 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.040
 this game against fortuna today 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.530
 maybe düsseldorf then 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.810
 overwhelm that does in red too 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.520
 left to right with lambertz always 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.040
 still lambertz those are good so the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.040
 moral and that's the 20th 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.860
 Good morning dear Munich 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.040
 19 seconds after offense the ball is in 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.670
 net behind gabor kiraly because he is here on 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.980
 walk early friday evening 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.350
 lumpi lambertz walks to the limit 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 vandenberg a break-in 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.140
 and the next possibility for fortuna 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.940
 düsseldorf masters still beister 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.950
 and then the cheap nails under the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.950
 latte and animal is something of sour 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.629
 and the master needs a whole while 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.000
 until he has registered that he has the ball 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:49.920
 actually shot in front of it pretty much 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.950
 funny number 67 minute 3 0 of the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.950
 towering man maximilian beister 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.780
 we let's see how long the need 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.500
 closes again from which angle the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.500
 concludes 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.940
 great goal 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.230
 and the animals 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.230
 it's so mad at steel 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.840
 30
