00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
little bit of a rough chop so the pieces

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.480 
little bit of a rough chop so the pieces
weren't<00:02:35.870> white<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.410> large<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.400> just

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
weren't white is large and I'm just

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.840 
weren't white is large and I'm just
going<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:37.790> ahead<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.210> mix<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.570> all<00:02:38.750> up<00:02:38.780> so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
going to go ahead and mix that all up so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.040 
going to go ahead and mix that all up so
like<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.970> said<00:02:41.150> earlier<00:02:41.480> these<00:02:41.750> spring<00:02:42.020> rolls

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
like I said earlier these spring rolls

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.930 
like I said earlier these spring rolls
are<00:02:42.380> hard<00:02:42.710> when<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:42.950> first<00:02:43.100> get<00:02:43.340> them<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:43.880> you

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
are hard when you first get them so you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700 
are hard when you first get them so you
need<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.420> submerge<00:02:44.660> them<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.080> in<00:02:45.290> water<00:02:45.530> I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
need to submerge them all in water I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.680 
need to submerge them all in water I
just<00:02:45.980> chose<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.400> shallow<00:02:46.730> dish<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.240> just<00:02:47.450> used

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
just chose a shallow dish and just used

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.920 
just chose a shallow dish and just used
spring<00:02:48.350> water<00:02:48.560> or<00:02:48.680> tap<00:02:49.070> water<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.580> I'm<00:02:50.330> giving

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
spring water or tap water and I'm giving

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.090 
spring water or tap water and I'm giving
it<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> shake<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.380> making<00:02:51.770> sure<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
it a shake and making sure that the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.920 
it a shake and making sure that the
edges<00:02:52.430> especially<00:02:52.640> are<00:02:53.120> fully<00:02:53.390> submerged<00:02:53.720> in

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
edges especially are fully submerged in

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.180 
edges especially are fully submerged in
water<00:02:53.960> because<00:02:54.380> that<00:02:54.650> will<00:02:54.770> make<00:02:54.860> sure<00:02:55.040> that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
water because that will make sure that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.400 
water because that will make sure that
it<00:02:55.280> rolls<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.000> pliable<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.350> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.470 

this<00:03:26.890> recipe<00:03:27.130> actually<00:03:27.310> makes<00:03:27.850> three<00:03:28.210> spring

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
this recipe actually makes three spring

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
this recipe actually makes three spring
rolls<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.840> I'm<00:03:28.960> going<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.110> show<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.320> guys<00:03:29.440> how

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
rolls and I'm going to show you guys how

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080 
rolls and I'm going to show you guys how
to<00:03:29.650> make<00:03:29.830> two<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.040> them<00:03:30.340> because<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.640> think<00:03:30.700> by

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
to make two of them because I think by

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.550 
to make two of them because I think by
the<00:03:31.150> end<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> second<00:03:32.020> one<00:03:32.140> you've<00:03:32.290> kind<00:03:32.530> of

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
the end of the second one you've kind of

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.220 
the end of the second one you've kind of
got<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.830> idea<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.090> do<00:03:34.210> want<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.870> explain

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
got the idea but I do want to explain

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.320 
got the idea but I do want to explain
how<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.500> roll<00:03:36.100> them<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.300> a

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
how to roll them because it can be a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.540 
how to roll them because it can be a
little<00:03:37.600> bit<00:03:37.720> tricky<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.530> I'm<00:03:39.190> going<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.400> start
