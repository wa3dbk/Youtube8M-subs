see how these guys perfected it here's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
see how these guys perfected it here's
Dave<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> I've<00:00:53.010> evolved<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.489> hunters<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.210> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
Dave and I've evolved as hunters and you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
Dave and I've evolved as hunters and you
know<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.840> part<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> maturation

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
know it's just part of the maturation

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
know it's just part of the maturation
process<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.370> learn<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:56.940> about

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
process as we learn more and more about

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150 
process as we learn more and more about
white<00:00:57.360> tails<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.899> specifically<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
white tails and specifically how we can

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.560 
white tails and specifically how we can
better<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.460> biologic<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> things

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
better use biologic one of the things

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.029 
better use biologic one of the things
we've<00:01:00.719> come<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> we'd<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> plant

green fruit sources you know this not
only<00:01:10.290> creates<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.830> edge<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> creates<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
only creates an edge but it creates a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
only creates an edge but it creates a
all<00:01:12.600> year<00:01:12.960> attracted<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.920> going

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
all year attracted because you're going

all year attracted because you're going
to<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.250> fresh<00:01:14.520> green<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.689> those

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to have fresh green to go with those

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
to have fresh green to go with those
beans<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.320> corn<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.830> sucks<00:01:17.189> those<00:01:17.369> deer<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
beans or corn it sucks those deer in and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.179 
beans or corn it sucks those deer in and
also<00:01:18.450> from<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> filming<00:01:19.140> perspective<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.979> gets

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
also from a filming perspective it gets

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.320 
also from a filming perspective it gets
them<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> those<00:01:20.520> trips<00:01:20.820> where<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> go

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
them in those trips where we can go

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.910 
them in those trips where we can go
ahead<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.659> video<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> hopefully<00:01:22.590> make<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
ahead and get video and hopefully make a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.080 
ahead and get video and hopefully make a
harvest<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> really

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
harvest you know and I think it really

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
harvest you know and I think it really
even<00:01:24.450> works<00:01:24.750> best<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.229> corn<00:01:25.439> fields<00:01:25.740> because

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
even works best in corn fields because

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
even works best in corn fields because
in<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> court<00:01:26.640> dude<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.030> hard<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
in the court dude it's hard to see the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.109 
in the court dude it's hard to see the
deer<00:01:27.810> anyway<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.040> only<00:01:29.100> gives<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.700> an

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
deer anyway so it not only gives you an

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
deer anyway so it not only gives you an
opportunity<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.869> view<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> animal<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
opportunity to view that animal but it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190 
opportunity to view that animal but it
you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.180> they're<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.600> keen<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.079> on

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
have it so fast but I mean we planned it

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.290 
have it so fast but I mean we planned it
this<00:02:13.629> way<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.170> all<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:14.860> corn

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
this way we have all this corn

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.580 
this way we have all this corn
everywhere<00:02:16.300> we've<00:02:16.510> got<00:02:16.690> biologic<00:02:17.290> down<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
everywhere we've got biologic down the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.690 
everywhere we've got biologic down the
middle<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.069> they're<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.519> go<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
middle of it they're going to go to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.309 
middle of it they're going to go to
those<00:02:18.849> trips<00:02:19.150> because<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.690> good<00:02:19.870> power<00:02:20.140> of

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
those trips because it's a good power of

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.530 
those trips because it's a good power of
a<00:02:20.379> food<00:02:20.590> source<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:21.010> time<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.340> year<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.700> I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
a food source that time of year and I

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.430 
a food source that time of year and I
think<00:02:22.900> you're<00:02:22.989> gonna<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.290> lot<00:02:23.379> more

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
think you're gonna have a lot more

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.800 
think you're gonna have a lot more
success
