00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
might feel like you're ripping off a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
over the sticky tape and by time you rip

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.979 
over the sticky tape and by time you rip
it<00:02:28.130> off<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:28.430> still<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.940> perfect<00:02:29.420> ok

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
from that point outwards I want to

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.720 
from that point outwards I want to
create<00:02:54.319> a<00:02:54.650> thicker<00:02:54.980> line<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.430> from<00:02:55.580> that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
create a thicker line and from that

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.820

point inwards I want to create a thinner
line<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.430> that's<00:02:58.609> how<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.850> get<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.090> perfect

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
line and that's how you get the perfect

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:06.099 
line and that's how you get the perfect
cat<00:02:59.840> eye<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:05.060> once<00:03:05.269> you've<00:03:05.420> done<00:03:05.630> your<00:03:05.780> flick

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
cat eye so once you've done your flick

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.800 
cat eye so once you've done your flick
now<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> can<00:03:06.799> just<00:03:07.040> go<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.600> find

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
now you can just go in and if you find

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.660 
now you can just go in and if you find
it<00:03:08.930> either<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.410> can<00:03:09.560> kind<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:09.920> join<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.459> dots

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
it either you can kind of join the dots

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.490 
it either you can kind of join the dots
but<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.180> me<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:11.329> just<00:03:11.570> find<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.840> easier<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.200> just

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
but for me I just find it easier to just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.860 
but for me I just find it easier to just
do<00:03:12.650> small<00:03:13.040> strokes<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.670> fill<00:03:14.359> in<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> rest<00:03:14.690> of

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
do small strokes and fill in the rest of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.190 
do small strokes and fill in the rest of
my<00:03:14.989> line<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:20.150> also<00:03:20.420> want<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:20.989> with

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
my line on you also want to do this with

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140 
my line on you also want to do this with
your<00:03:21.290> eyes<00:03:21.350> looking<00:03:21.890> down<00:03:21.920> rather<00:03:22.549> than<00:03:22.730> close

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
your eyes looking down rather than close

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.509 
your eyes looking down rather than close
and<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.570> prevents<00:03:24.290> those<00:03:24.530> tiny<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.250> lines

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
and that prevents those tiny the lines

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.130 
and that prevents those tiny the lines
from<00:03:25.910> where<00:03:26.120> your<00:03:26.390> skin<00:03:26.720> eventually

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
from where your skin eventually

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.789 
from where your skin eventually
stretches<00:03:27.590> out<00:03:31.989> once<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.140> feel<00:03:33.320> happy<00:03:33.470> with

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
stretches out once you feel happy with

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.949 
stretches out once you feel happy with
your<00:03:33.920> eyeliner<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.700> can<00:03:34.820> go<00:03:34.970> ahead<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.269> peel

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
your eyeliner you can go ahead and peel

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.929 
your eyeliner you can go ahead and peel
off<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.230> sea<00:03:36.440> tape

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.880 

that<00:03:43.939> to<00:03:44.180> me<00:03:44.329> just<00:03:44.599> feels<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:45.140> hundred<00:03:45.650> times

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
that to me just feels a hundred times

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.520 
that to me just feels a hundred times

too<00:04:10.430> tight<00:04:10.700> line<00:04:10.939> my<00:04:10.970> inner<00:04:11.510> waterline<00:04:12.140> I

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
too tight line my inner waterline I

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.140

my eyeball and my eyeliner if that makes

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.909 
my eyeball and my eyeliner if that makes
sense<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.120> just<00:04:17.630> think<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.930> kind<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.260> takes<00:04:18.709> away

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
sense I just think it kind of takes away

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.629

the<00:04:19.459> strength<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.209> eyeliner<00:04:24.639> another

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
eyes match particularly because I'm

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.740 
eyes match particularly because I'm
pretty<00:04:49.039> sure<00:04:49.310> my<00:04:49.490> face<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:50.030> completely
