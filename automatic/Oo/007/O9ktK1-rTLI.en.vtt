lot<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.130> costumes<00:00:20.990> definitely<00:00:21.990> involve

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
lot of the costumes definitely involve

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.700 
lot of the costumes definitely involve
other<00:00:22.590> weeks<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.789> very<00:00:24.390> high<00:00:24.930> hair<00:00:25.410> and

other weeks or very very high hair and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
other weeks or very very high hair and
which<00:00:26.490> means<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> need<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.359> how<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
which means that you need to know how to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.570 
which means that you need to know how to
get<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.230> much<00:00:28.410> volume<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:28.920> possible<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.519> then

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
get as much volume as possible and then

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
get as much volume as possible and then
I<00:00:30.029> started<00:00:30.330> thinking<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.410> actually

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I started thinking that this is actually

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860 
I started thinking that this is actually
something<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.189> every<00:00:32.940> woman<00:00:33.090> needs<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.719> know

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
something that every woman needs to know

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
something that every woman needs to know
especially<00:00:34.559> girls<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.340> we've<00:00:35.520> been<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
especially girls like we've been with a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.569 
especially girls like we've been with a
little<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.329> fine<00:00:37.079> hair<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> its<00:00:38.370> really

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
little bit of fine hair and its really

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.979 
little bit of fine hair and its really
good<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> little

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
good to know how to just get a little

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.650 
good to know how to just get a little
bit<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> volume<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.860> quickly<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> thought

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
bit of volume very quickly so I thought

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
bit of volume very quickly so I thought
that's<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.260> base<00:00:43.410> my<00:00:43.440> video<00:00:43.920> today

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that's what I will base my video today

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
that's what I will base my video today
on<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> show<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> three

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
on so I'm just going to show you three

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
on so I'm just going to show you three
release<00:00:47.219> simple<00:00:47.700> ways<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> add<00:00:48.329> volume<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
release simple ways to add volume to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.869 
release simple ways to add volume to
your<00:00:49.079> hair<00:00:49.200> now<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> first<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> most

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
your hair now the first is the most

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
your hair now the first is the most
common<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.690> obviously<00:00:51.930> about

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
common and that's obviously about

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
common and that's obviously about
climbing<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.300> need<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
climbing and all you need for that is a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.590 
climbing and all you need for that is a
little<00:00:55.320> tail<00:00:55.530> comb<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.940> but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
little tail comb like this one here but

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
little tail comb like this one here but
I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:57.719> where<00:00:58.109> women<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.590> wrong<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.399> guys<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I think where women go wrong with guys I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.360 
I think where women go wrong with guys I
guess<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.629> well<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.500> backcombing<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
guess as well with the backcombing is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.939 
guess as well with the backcombing is
they<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> down<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> hair<00:01:04.739> which

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
they go up and down on the hair which

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.500 
they go up and down on the hair which
isn't<00:01:05.729> quite<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
isn't quite right because you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.859 
isn't quite right because you
technically<00:01:07.200> undoing<00:01:07.920> everything<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:09.119> like

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
technically undoing everything that like

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
technically undoing everything that like
all<00:01:10.049> your<00:01:10.200> hard<00:01:10.380> work<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
all your hard work so I'm just going to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
all your hard work so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.409> take

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
demonstrate a little bit here you take

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.350 
demonstrate a little bit here you take
pieces<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> hair<00:01:14.400> at<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:15.090> remove

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
pieces of hair at the back up remove

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
pieces of hair at the back up remove
this<00:01:15.509> back<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> full

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this back so that you can get a full

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.820 
this back so that you can get a full
view<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> take<00:01:18.570> sections<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.320> hair<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
view so you take sections of hair at the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.320 
view so you take sections of hair at the
back<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.250> head<00:01:20.369> starting<00:01:20.909> around<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
back of your head starting around the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
back of your head starting around the
ground<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.290> work<00:01:22.470> forward<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> want

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ground you can work forward if you want

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
ground you can work forward if you want
and<00:01:23.549> basically<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.420> put<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> comb<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and basically you put the comb in and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
and basically you put the comb in and
just<00:01:26.100> push<00:01:26.340> down<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.630> need<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.020> do

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
just push down that's all you need to do

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
just push down that's all you need to do
push<00:01:29.040> down<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.180> vigorously<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
push down don't go vigorously up and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
push down don't go vigorously up and
down<00:01:31.409> take<00:01:32.340> another<00:01:32.640> section<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> back

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
down take another section at the back

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.020 
down take another section at the back
now<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.500> tend<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:35.549> larger

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
now I tend to do this and take larger

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.359 
now I tend to do this and take larger
sections<00:01:36.540> plat<00:01:37.049> haphazardly<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
sections plat haphazardly but if you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.190 
sections plat haphazardly but if you
want<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
want to do it with a little bit more you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
want to do it with a little bit more you
know<00:01:40.229> proper<00:01:40.740> separation<00:01:40.890> tools<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> clits

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
know proper separation tools and clits

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.580 
know proper separation tools and clits
and<00:01:42.390> things<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.869> can't<00:01:43.079> begin<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and things like that you can't begin to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.520 
and things like that you can't begin to
push<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.460> push<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.200> spray

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
push down push down and then you spray

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.580 
push down push down and then you spray
each<00:01:46.770> section<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.850> hairspray<00:01:48.299> push<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> back

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
each section with hairspray push it back

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
each section with hairspray push it back
and<00:01:49.920> climb<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.149> obviously<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and climb it out now obviously this is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.179 
and climb it out now obviously this is
uneven<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.619> don't<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> spend<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
uneven but I don't want to spend the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
uneven but I don't want to spend the
whole<00:01:53.310> video<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> work<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.630> around<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
whole video but you work all around the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
whole video but you work all around the
crown<00:01:55.409> doing<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.219> already<00:01:56.460> see

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
crown doing that and you can already see

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.609 
crown doing that and you can already see
just<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.509> bit<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> volume<00:01:57.869> coming<00:01:58.409> at

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
just a little bit of volume coming at

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.440 
just a little bit of volume coming at
the<00:01:58.710> back<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.549> concentrate<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.240> make

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the back if you concentrate that make

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
the back if you concentrate that make
sure<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.840> even<00:02:01.229> mind<00:02:01.469> isn't<00:02:01.619> gonna<00:02:01.860> be

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
sure it's all even mind isn't gonna be

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.319 
sure it's all even mind isn't gonna be
my<00:02:02.250> hair's<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.790> all<00:02:02.850> over<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> place

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
my hair's gonna be all over the place

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.209 
my hair's gonna be all over the place
for<00:02:03.600> most<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> video<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.590> okay<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
for most of the video that's okay and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.370 
for most of the video that's okay and
you<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> do<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:06.659> evenly<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you want to do it all evenly and you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.749 
you want to do it all evenly and you
just<00:02:07.530> get<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.770> beautiful<00:02:08.009> little<00:02:08.310> puff<00:02:08.610> at

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
just get this beautiful little puff at

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.249 
just get this beautiful little puff at
the<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.450> take<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.810> forward<00:02:10.050> if

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the back and you can take it forward if

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
the back and you can take it forward if
you<00:02:10.379> want<00:02:10.560> more<00:02:10.739> height<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.520> way<00:02:11.640> through

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you want more height all the way through

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.850 
you want more height all the way through
the<00:02:11.940> back<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.420> sky

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
the back of the sky

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.410 
the back of the sky
whatever<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
whatever you want but I think the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.840 
whatever you want but I think the
easiest<00:02:14.690> way<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.320> add<00:02:15.440> volume<00:02:15.770> very<00:02:16.580> quickly

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
easiest way to add volume very quickly

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.180 
easiest way to add volume very quickly
is<00:02:17.810> with<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.140> tail<00:02:18.320> comb<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.830> coming

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
is with the tail comb of that coming

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.670 
is with the tail comb of that coming
just<00:02:19.640> remember<00:02:20.060> not<00:02:20.360> up<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.690> down<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.290> even

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
just remember not up and down just even

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.130 
just remember not up and down just even
the<00:02:21.770> hair<00:02:21.980> down<00:02:22.580> that's<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.480> pull<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.750> out<00:02:23.930> do

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the hair down that's it pull it out do

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.070 
the hair down that's it pull it out do
it<00:02:24.260> again<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:25.460> first<00:02:25.490> babe<00:02:26.150> now<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
it again so that's my first babe now the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.980 
it again so that's my first babe now the
second<00:02:27.500> way<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.890> with<00:02:28.550> your<00:02:28.940> solar<00:02:29.510> heat

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
second way is with your solar heat

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.230 
second way is with your solar heat
sailor<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.890> isn't<00:02:31.190> plugged<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.760> it's<00:02:32.030> I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
sailor this isn't plugged in so it's I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.390 
sailor this isn't plugged in so it's I
was<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:32.810> using<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.620> might<00:02:33.830> still<00:02:34.130> be

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
was just using it so it might still be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.310 
was just using it so it might still be
hot<00:02:34.610> enough<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.360> basically<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:36.110> can

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
hot enough but basically you can

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.690 
hot enough but basically you can
maneuver<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.100> very<00:02:37.790> very<00:02:38.709> useful<00:02:39.709> tool<00:02:40.070> not

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
maneuver this very very useful tool not

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.850 
maneuver this very very useful tool not
just<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.060> curl<00:02:41.420> your<00:02:41.450> ends<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.320> also<00:02:42.500> give

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
just to curl your ends but to also give

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.890 
just to curl your ends but to also give
you<00:02:43.010> more<00:02:43.220> volume<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.790> your<00:02:43.820> roots<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.450> all

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
you more volume on your roots and all

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
you more volume on your roots and all
you<00:02:44.990> have<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.830> literally<00:02:46.310> put<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.850> in

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
you have to do is literally put it in

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.800 
you have to do is literally put it in
wherever<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.570> want<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.140> turn<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:50.510> styler

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
wherever you want it and turn the styler

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.449 
wherever you want it and turn the styler
up<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.320> hopefully<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.739> guys<00:02:51.830> can<00:02:51.890> see<00:02:52.280> that

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
up so hopefully you guys can see that

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.610 
up so hopefully you guys can see that
just<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.120> get<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.450> hot<00:02:53.989> there<00:02:54.320> and

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
just so that you get that hot there and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.949 
just so that you get that hot there and
then<00:02:55.160> take<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.520> away<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:56.180> isn't<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.750> isn't

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
then take it away this isn't this isn't

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.090 
then take it away this isn't this isn't
hot<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.380> it's<00:02:57.470> probably<00:02:57.620> not<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> work

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
hot so it's probably not going to work

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.320 
hot so it's probably not going to work
as<00:02:58.310> well<00:02:58.459> but<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.760> works<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.060> little<00:02:59.090> bit

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
as well but it works a little bit

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.150 
as well but it works a little bit
because<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.720> still<00:02:59.930> warm<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:01.010> can

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
because it's still warm and you can

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.900 
because it's still warm and you can
already<00:03:01.459> see<00:03:01.910> by<00:03:02.300> maneuvering<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:04.040> tool<00:03:04.340> to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
already see by maneuvering the tool to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.370 
already see by maneuvering the tool to
have<00:03:05.150> your<00:03:05.300> hair<00:03:05.480> straight<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:06.020> just<00:03:06.200> gives

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
have your hair straight it just gives

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.750 
have your hair straight it just gives
you<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> little<00:03:06.709> bit<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.920> lift<00:03:07.130> there<00:03:07.340> so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
you a little bit of lift there so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.940 
you a little bit of lift there so
literally<00:03:08.120> imagine<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.080> your<00:03:09.230> hair<00:03:09.410> you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
literally imagine this is your hair you

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.370 
literally imagine this is your hair you
put<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.340> straight<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.940> tilt<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.840> possible
