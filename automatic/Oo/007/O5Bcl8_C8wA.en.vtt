 St. Petersburg today had to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.540
 defend from holy judah with the coming 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 the storm posed a flood hazard in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.260
 flax area according to the latest reports 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.599

 power supply emerged immediately in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.869
 several regions in total they 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 touched above 20 thousand people in Europe 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.320
 by which the hurricane originated from 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 british isles hit full force 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 picture is much more dismal number 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.529
 dead houses there goes to hundreds 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.079
 thousand but the main thing could not be avoided 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.090
 casualties of the dead 13 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.829
 Konstantin Goldin tried to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.050
 estimate the scale of the disaster in the old world 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.620
 Nikolai Bulkin in Petersburg met with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.670
 bad weather what is called face to face 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090
 Petersburg give me it's hard to resist 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.930
 on foot 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.329
 blowing off your feet and very hard to talk 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 against the wind the very morning the wind 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.329
 intensified and now you can definitely 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.579
 say that hurricane petersburg now 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.850
 the wind is such a booming hail on the outskirts 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.280
 the city and by audi block huge 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.060
 gates of the Petersburg dam which began at 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 Gulf of Finland 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.170
 for the enemy in the wind that he threatens the city 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 flood in fact departs wave 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 petersburg was this big water not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.230
 allowed to leave and absolutely small ones 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.320
 there are such gaps all over 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.240
 Dam forecasters ask for the nature of clouds 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.000
 do not thicken coming to the Russian shores 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.220
 holy Judah wasted by the evening 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.370
 Already subside, we still expect 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.190
 that at the beginning of the night there will still be 15 impulses 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.500
 meters per second 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.660
 but by the morning everything should weaken the level 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.740
 water of course will be during the day too 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 weakening wind 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 by the beginning of the night everything should be already too 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.520
 ended and a strong hurricane and wind 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.890

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.410
 20 meters per second go farther on 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.049
 North East 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.390
 ominous irony of fate Hurricane saint 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.819
 Judah named after the patron 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.500

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.310
 unhappiness for at least 13 families 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.940
 so many dead across northern europe 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.970
 counted 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.769
 rescue service and this is for now 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.019
 intermediate figures swirling down 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.359
 trees road signs and billboards 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.880
 last Monday became a black day 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.850
 for hundreds of car owners from germany and 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.320
 sweden to belgium and france well ropes 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.359
 special profits in the country first 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.090

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.430
 worst wind ahead 130 kilometers an hour 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.950
 the main task to strengthen the roofs of buildings 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.470
 shingles and bloody antenna bills 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.380
 roofs where we do not have to approach 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.079
 fence pedestrians chop wood bitch 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.739
 fly and right on the heads of public utilities and 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.739
 the fireman

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.130
 Hamburg neighborhood walk down the street 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.470

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.160
 flying through the air 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.260
 I thought okay I will go on foot but the feeling 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.180
 do they even go go the same 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.990

 however get to the house by train or 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.190
 the subway was simply impossible almost all 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.010
 rail service in denmark and on 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.720
 north of germany stood next in 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.640
 rural main transport channel 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.360
 artery between the north and baltic 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.760
 ocean waves raged here 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.620
 one of the results faced due to the enemy 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.510
 on the ship and him while we're still 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.070
 trying to corrupt two ships at 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.930
 help tug masters do everything 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.470
 so that the ship is not carried away with the flow 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.210
 channel 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.640
 German police called on citizens 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.040
 stay home with locked windows and 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.050
 hidden car garage but advice 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.450
 benefited not closer to the night 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.750
 the situation became critical in denmark and on 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.000

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.320
 collapsed wood and all electricity is not 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.419
 scale of damage to the element 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.310
 northern europe has yet to be counted 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.770
 but insurers in most countries 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.750
 those affected by the hurricane are already warning 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.990
 money for all affected hardly 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.400
