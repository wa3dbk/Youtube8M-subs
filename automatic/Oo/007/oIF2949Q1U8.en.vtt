00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph like that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.080
 It's summer and we want it, of course 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.700
 everybody goes out for a walk again 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.210
 go on a vacation and so on and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 so on 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.949
 there belongs a very special mobile phone 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.630
 and I have a very special one 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 I brought what I have here in hand 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 I've got the xt 710 v2 from simvalley 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.730
 Now I do not know but what is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.679
 can I know that I would give them 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.620
 sometimes counts tell and show 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.629
 look at the display has one 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.430
 resolution of 176 x 220 pixels 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.860
 a bit unusual but nice and wide 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
 and clearly so now I have here 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.200
 Of course, lots of things menus and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 everything that just any phone can do 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 this is internet gprs it can web 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.140
 2.0 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.719
 it can bluetooth and it has a radio 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 built-in and built-in video player and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.180
 so on and so on, but it has 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 something that many other phones just do 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.229
 do not have there at the place 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.310
 there they are 24 2 degrees 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.790
 Celsius 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 if I switch on here now then 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:29.909
 we can even have 988 hectopascals 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 read yes continue switch height 214.9 the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.280
 Incidental resolution is 30, by the way 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 cm and there at an angle of 81 degrees I'm fine 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.659
 look now direction moon which shows so 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 not right at two degrees resolution 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 has the compass and when i return 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.490
 keeps switching over at the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.570
 temperature with 24 7 degrees celsius so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 a real nice outdoor phone 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 but of course it has something else 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.960
 is also part of it 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 a beautiful bright flashlight and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.570
 next to it there is still a hole what is that 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.229
 I show you there is a laser pointer 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.780
 in it 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.640
 so you can then sos from the mountains 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.460
 tomorrow or something 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.750
 so lots of accessories is so so 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.459
 I can not give them much anymore 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.690
 So show earplugs and charger and 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.500
 connection cable and here I have something 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.660
 found 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.880
 I think so completely crazy that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.950
 is a small device with usb connection 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.350
 a light emitting diode and one out 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.630
 foldable crank and so that they can 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.540
 if they are somewhere far away 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.610
 wall socket and her phone is lea 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 via the supplied connection cable 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.900
 your child of charging and I want that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.820
 Now try how long that takes 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.820
 feels like talking on the phone again
