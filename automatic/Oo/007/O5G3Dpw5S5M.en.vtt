which<00:05:13.700> is<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.850> really<00:05:14.150> low<00:05:14.479> deal<00:05:14.960> because

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
which is a really low deal because

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.820 
which is a really low deal because
that's<00:05:16.550> only<00:05:16.729> like<00:05:16.850> 1.9<00:05:17.780> bus<00:05:18.140> maybe<00:05:18.530> less<00:05:18.800> than

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
that's only like 1.9 bus maybe less than

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.560 
that's only like 1.9 bus maybe less than
that<00:05:19.070> so<00:05:19.370> that's<00:05:19.550> just<00:05:19.669> under<00:05:19.970> two<00:05:20.360> buds

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
that so that's just under two buds

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.300 
that so that's just under two buds
pretty<00:05:20.840> much<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.470> each<00:05:21.740> of<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.950> hats<00:05:22.160> are

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
pretty much and each of the hats are

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.219 
pretty much and each of the hats are
worth<00:05:22.490> like<00:05:22.640> 2.5<00:05:23.270> bucks<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:23.690> obviously<00:05:24.080> the

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
worth like 2.5 bucks so obviously the

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.969 
worth like 2.5 bucks so obviously the
guy<00:05:24.350> wasn't<00:05:24.590> gonna<00:05:26.380> not<00:05:27.380> accept<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.800> deal

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
guy wasn't gonna not accept a deal

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.670 
guy wasn't gonna not accept a deal
because<00:05:28.220> it<00:05:28.460> was<00:05:28.550> absolute<00:05:29.210> great<00:05:29.540> deal<00:05:29.780> and
