00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
two or three minutes just cuz I've

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.330 
two or three minutes just cuz I've
fallen<00:04:12.590> down<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:13.099> much<00:04:14.680> that's<00:04:15.680> really<00:04:16.070> sad<00:04:16.310> I

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
fallen down so much that's really sad I

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.509 
fallen down so much that's really sad I
just<00:04:16.549> thought<00:04:16.849> of<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.060> um<00:04:17.389> okay<00:04:18.169> well<00:04:18.530> it's

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
just thought of that um okay well it's

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.339 
just thought of that um okay well it's
so<00:04:19.849> there's<00:04:20.030> gonna<00:04:20.120> be<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.329> super<00:04:20.690> super<00:04:20.900> super

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
so there's gonna be a super super super

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.870 
so there's gonna be a super super super
short<00:04:21.530> episode<00:04:22.009> but<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> guess<00:04:22.669> there's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
short episode but I guess there's

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.620 
short episode but I guess there's
nothing<00:04:23.000> wrong<00:04:23.270> with<00:04:23.419> that

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
nothing wrong with that

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.300 
nothing wrong with that
okay<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:25.930> I'm<00:04:26.290> just<00:04:26.590> gonna<00:04:26.800> go<00:04:26.980> ahead<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.190> cut

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and cut

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.840 
okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and cut

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
best way of how we should go about doing

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.320
