 with a new regulation that will go into 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.240

 categories are divided by size by 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 age and by weight are relative what 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.050
 important is knowing the child's weight 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 because the designers of the chairs 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.350
 designs according to the weight of the chair 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 then in four types of chairs 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.909
 important 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.159
 this regulation as an instruction for 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.920
 parents how their children should go in 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.380
 the vehicles the categories were made 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.540
 by age weight and height of the child 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.460
 Tuesday began the training for 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.090
 transit officials that from the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.070
 next week will apply sanctions of 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.020
 189 thousand colones not only to those who do not 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 carry in the device for minors 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.000
 but also here do not use the right ones 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 Officials recognize that there is no 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 culture appropriate for the safety of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.399
 the minors 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.259
 the excuses is totally that is more 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.610
 safe in the arms of the mother or 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.560
 father 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.670

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.120
 training and with the videos that he has 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.710
 supplied that rather the child in that 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.190
 aspect becomes a projectile that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.350
 it's super dangerous it has been noticed that a 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.600
 child in those conditions and with a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.700
 pretext that you should not use it because it is 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.490
 very uncomfortable etcetera etc. suffer 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.800
 many many injuries that could be 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.840
 have avoided using the device 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.240
 the regulation is ready for its 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.400
