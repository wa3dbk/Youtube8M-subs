00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.510 
now you're not going to do three
obviously<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.799> them<00:01:22.920> into<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> thing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
obviously but you put them into a thing

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
obviously but you put them into a thing
I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.820> try<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.330> sure<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.500> don't

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I would try to make sure that they don't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.789 
I would try to make sure that they don't
touch<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:27.150> slide<00:01:28.110> boy<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.590> probably

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
touch the slide boy you're probably

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
touch the slide boy you're probably
getting<00:01:29.009> dizzy<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.240> name<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
getting dizzy on this one my name is I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.640 
getting dizzy on this one my name is I
would<00:01:30.750> try<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.110> sure<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.530> don't

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
would try to make sure that they don't

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.140 
would try to make sure that they don't
touch<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.250> sides<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:32.970> they'll

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
touch the sides because then they'll

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
touch the sides because then they'll
stick<00:01:33.619> set<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.890> 220<00:01:35.960> which<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.320> what

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
stick set it at 220 which is about what

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.460 
stick set it at 220 which is about what
you<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> pot<00:01:38.189> roast<00:01:38.220> at
