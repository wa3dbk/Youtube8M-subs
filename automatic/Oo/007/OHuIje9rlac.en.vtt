00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.180
 you have a origami paper tulip 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.349
 fake now I will tell her technology 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.259
 run for making tulip 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.890
 she will need two sheets of paper green 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.109
 whole leaf a4 for leaf and red or 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.800
 orange how do you pick for the most 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 flower 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.350
 just need half of the orange 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.150
 paper make a square for this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 we fold like this 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:46.260
 triangle and cut off the excess part 1 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:54.360
 to you our mystic once again bends 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:57.559
 diagonal is two times yours 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.559
 and a little book 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:15.399
 now we need to fold so that 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:15.399
 triangle turned one side 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.940
 and the second combine terns 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:36.030
 every triangle is such 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.030
 edge bend up 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.270
 turn and repeat this operation 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.670
 and fold each edge 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.910
 in half so that here we have turned 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:13.090
 smooth paper and fold the edges so 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.900
 so that they love a little bit with lap 1 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.900
 of 2 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.210
 turn over the workpiece repeat too 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.210
 sleep 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:45.550
 hiding triangles one this friend 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.920
 sides and with this the same thing I tucked 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.480
 triangles from two sides inserted one 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.580
 at work with that neatly 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.300
 holding your fingers need to blow in 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.430
 see the hole figure I straightened 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.560
 thought the girl and the tulip we 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.340
 it turned out it was necessary only to bend 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.190
 petals 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.670
 each petal is gently bent in 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.670
 the side 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.980
 we have a tulip now 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.130
 do for tulip and stalk and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.620
 sheet for this from paper sheet 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 make a square fold like this 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.810
 diagonally cut off the excess 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:56.850
 we break our sheet and fold each 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:56.850
 edge to the center like this and 2 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:16.320
 now take the corners of the lower floor 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.320
 we fold to the center of the center line and 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.490
 2 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.550
 fold the corners to the center again 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.260
 It turns out here with a little overlap 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.260
 note 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.770
 such a figure we turn our 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.900
 billet side by side now 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.900
 we fold our figure in half like this and 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.030
 once again now slightly 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.470
 arms up to get 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.470
 small stalk and leaf 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:34.420
 so that our leaf slightly bend it 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:37.240
 you can and so spend the night and he will 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:50.930
 fight back 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:53.390
 she stalk wear our tulip here is our 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.710
 paper tulip is ready to look 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.710
 what a beauty
