00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
taking too high of already looks like

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
taking too high of already looks like

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.229 
Archon upgrades as you see going along
its<00:00:54.870> kinda<00:00:55.050> i<00:00:55.199> should<00:00:55.469> say<00:00:55.590> he's<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.920> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
he's going to have that tech advantage

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
he's going to have that tech advantage
fairly<00:01:13.350> quick<00:01:13.500> he's<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.920> those<00:01:14.070> de

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
fairly quick he's going to have those de

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.719 
fairly quick he's going to have those de
filers<00:01:14.520> alongside<00:01:15.650> momentarily<00:01:16.650> would<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> my

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
filers alongside momentarily would be my

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.130 
filers alongside momentarily would be my
guess<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.180> lure<00:01:18.330> curling<00:01:18.630> combination

as many probes is I think he wanted to
there<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.980> still<00:03:15.190> yeah<00:03:15.460> these<00:03:15.550> mules<00:03:15.820> just

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120

wreaking<00:03:16.390> havoc<00:03:16.690> as<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.020> see<00:03:17.500> they<00:03:17.620> have

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
wreaking havoc as you can see they have

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.470 
wreaking havoc as you can see they have
free<00:03:18.070> reign<00:03:18.250> over<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.520> field<00:03:18.700> another<00:03:19.270> Dark

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
free reign over the field another Dark

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.910 
free reign over the field another Dark
Templar<00:03:19.600> coming<00:03:20.050> up<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.500> looks<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.770> the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
Templar coming up and it looks like the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.170 
Templar coming up and it looks like the
lurkers<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.340> links<00:03:21.520> now<00:03:21.670> gathering<00:03:22.000> up

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
lurkers and links now gathering up

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.970 
lurkers and links now gathering up
outside<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.570> day<00:03:22.750> night's<00:03:22.930> base<00:03:23.170> switching<00:03:23.920> a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
outside of day night's base switching a

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.830 
outside of day night's base switching a
greater<00:03:24.280> Spyre<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.060> he's<00:03:25.300> going<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.480> go<00:03:25.630> for<00:03:25.810> a

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
greater Spyre so he's going to go for a

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080 
greater Spyre so he's going to go for a
bigger<00:03:26.110> attack<00:03:26.560> here<00:03:26.830> interestingly<00:03:27.640> enough

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
bigger attack here interestingly enough

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.370 
bigger attack here interestingly enough
so<00:03:28.239> we're<00:03:28.330> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.510> switch<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.870> guardians<00:03:29.260> or

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
so we're going to switch to guardians or

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.630 
so we're going to switch to guardians or
something<00:03:29.650> along<00:03:29.709> those<00:03:29.890> lines<00:03:30.010> he<00:03:30.250> does<00:03:30.459> have

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
something along those lines he does have

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.850 
something along those lines he does have
the<00:03:30.760> gas<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.940> do<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.420> he's<00:03:32.200> also<00:03:32.440> got<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
the gas to do it he's also got the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.190 
the gas to do it he's also got the
filers<00:03:33.220> alongside<00:03:33.520> this<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.540> interesting<00:03:34.989> I'm

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
filers alongside this is interesting I'm

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.360 
filers alongside this is interesting I'm
curious<00:03:35.470> how<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.680> Defiler<00:03:36.040> czar<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
curious how the Defiler czar going to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250 
curious how the Defiler czar going to
play<00:03:36.459> along<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.000> looks<00:03:37.209> like<00:03:37.270> this<00:03:38.050> upper

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
play along and it looks like this upper

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.540 
play along and it looks like this upper
left-hand<00:03:38.500> base<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:38.890> going<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.160> be<00:03:39.220> stopped<00:03:39.430> by

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
left-hand base is going to be stopped by

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.790 
left-hand base is going to be stopped by
that<00:03:39.580> Dark<00:03:39.880> Templar<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.300> this<00:03:40.450> meantime<00:03:40.800> these

that Dark Templar on this meantime these
mule<00:03:42.340> escs<00:03:42.610> probably<00:03:43.209> going<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.390> turn<00:03:43.510> into

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
mule escs probably going to turn into

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.680 
mule escs probably going to turn into
guardians<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.769> take<00:03:45.010> out<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.540> space<00:03:46.540> right

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
guardians and take out this space right

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.780 
guardians and take out this space right
here<00:03:46.750> he<00:03:47.050> knows<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.500> dues<00:03:47.709> hasn't<00:03:48.370> gone<00:03:48.489> air

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
here he knows that dues hasn't gone air

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.820 
here he knows that dues hasn't gone air
at<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.239> stage<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.720> very<00:03:50.050> clever<00:03:50.260> maneuver<00:03:50.560> on

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
at this stage so very clever maneuver on
