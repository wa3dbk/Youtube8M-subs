gonna speed it up so it doesn't take you
long<00:00:19.580> just<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.760> an<00:00:20.910> hour<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.270> between<00:00:21.359> four

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
long just like an hour in between four

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130 
long just like an hour in between four
bowls<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.939> this<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.119> takes<00:00:24.240> 40<00:00:24.600> minutes<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
bowls for this it takes 40 minutes and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.870 
bowls for this it takes 40 minutes and
then<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> other<00:00:25.619> one<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.340> takes<00:00:26.519> about<00:00:26.699> an

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
then for the other one it takes about an

hour and we do get to keep two of our

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460 
hour and we do get to keep two of our
orbs<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> good<00:00:30.810> orbs<00:00:31.199> because

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
orbs not really that good orbs because

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
orbs not really that good orbs because
if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> get<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:31.890> from<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> mail<00:00:32.340> but

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
if you get them from the mail but

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
if you get them from the mail but

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
nonetheless you can keep orbs so there

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
nonetheless you can keep orbs so there
you<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> Platinum<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.809> it's

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

gonna be checking on its skills it isn't
okay<00:00:45.239> Miam<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:46.110> speed<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.340> uh<00:00:48.230> not

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
okay Miam with speed I think it's uh not

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.170 
okay Miam with speed I think it's uh not
the<00:00:49.379> fastest<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> faster

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the fastest one but one of the faster

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
the fastest one but one of the faster
Platinum's<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:51.989> currently<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.590> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
Platinum's that we currently have I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
Platinum's that we currently have I
won't<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.160> trying<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.670> many<00:00:53.789> bottoms

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
won't be trying to get as many bottoms

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.689 
won't be trying to get as many bottoms
as<00:00:54.329> possible<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> gonna<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
as possible so this is gonna be one of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
as possible so this is gonna be one of
the<00:00:56.760> ones<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.719> change<00:00:57.930> this

we do want a faster one so there you go

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.410 
we do want a faster one so there you go
there<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> Platinum<00:01:07.820> seven<00:01:08.820> point<00:01:09.030> six

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
there is the Platinum seven point six

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
there is the Platinum seven point six
nine<00:01:09.600> speed<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.920> quite<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> bit

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
nine speed which is quite a bit

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
nine speed which is quite a bit
controlling<00:01:11.970> speed<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.420> make<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.689> even<00:01:12.900> faster

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
controlling speed or make it even faster

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.039 
controlling speed or make it even faster
we<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.710> 1800<00:01:14.670> HP<00:01:17.420> there's<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.689> no<00:01:18.869> reason

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
we got 1800 HP there's really no reason

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.300 
we got 1800 HP there's really no reason
to<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> Platinum<00:01:19.950> version

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to actually get the Platinum version

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
to actually get the Platinum version
currently<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.270> pretty<00:01:21.420> sure<00:01:21.570> there's<00:01:21.750> gonna

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
currently I'm pretty sure there's gonna

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.490 
currently I'm pretty sure there's gonna
be<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.610> bingo<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.909> them<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.600> point<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
be a bingo for them at some point but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
let's actually check out the skills I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
let's actually check out the skills I
really<00:01:27.420> wish<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> Platinum<00:01:27.960> ones<00:01:28.290> they

could've did but basically the same

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.670 
could've did but basically the same
thing<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.920> yeah<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.130> about<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:43.140> yeah

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I'm not gonna be making this one my tank

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
I'm not gonna be making this one my tank
I'm<00:01:47.090> pretty<00:01:48.090> sure<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.420> gonna<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.720> much<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.569 
I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be much I
if<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> does<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.399> tackle

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
if it does actually get my tackle

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.190 
if it does actually get my tackle
probably<00:01:51.270> trying<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.630> make<00:01:51.750> another<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> as

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
probably trying to make another one as

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.160 
probably trying to make another one as
soon<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.500> possible<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.329> far<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.810> do<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
soon as possible but so far we do have a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.289 
soon as possible but so far we do have a
few<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.070> plenums<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.909> don't<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.119> how<00:01:57.240> many

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
few of the plenums I don't know how many

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.819 
few of the plenums I don't know how many
there<00:01:57.659> are<00:01:57.869> currently<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.380> game<00:01:58.530> but

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
there are currently in the game but

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.350 
there are currently in the game but
these<00:01:59.280> were<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> two<00:01:59.700> new<00:01:59.850> ones<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.299> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
these were the two new ones I think I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.190 
these were the two new ones I think I
added<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> decided<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.729> them

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
added in so I decided to make them

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.930 
added in so I decided to make them
there's<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> gold<00:02:04.530> version

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
there's the gold version

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.910 
there's the gold version
I<00:02:05.970> don't<00:02:06.690> have<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> bronze<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.410> but<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
I don't have the bronze one but the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.790 
I don't have the bronze one but the
summer<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.490> well<00:02:09.200> we<00:02:10.200> start<00:02:10.500> off<00:02:10.619> with

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
summer one as well we start off with

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 
summer one as well we start off with
quite<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.490> HP<00:02:11.880> though<00:02:12.060> 1800<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.020> compared

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
quite a bit of HP though 1800 a compared

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.070 
quite a bit of HP though 1800 a compared
to<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.160> 1600<00:02:15.000> plus<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.360> attack<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
to the 1600 plus the attack is like a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
to the 1600 plus the attack is like a
hundred<00:02:16.380> more<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.810> hip<00:02:19.140> da<00:02:19.350> more

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
hundred more now it's like hip da more

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.970 
hundred more now it's like hip da more
so<00:02:21.080> we<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.350> words<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.710> this<00:02:22.800> one<00:02:22.950> I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so we do have that words on this one I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.110 
so we do have that words on this one I
thought<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.250> don't<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.670> yeah<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.000> think
