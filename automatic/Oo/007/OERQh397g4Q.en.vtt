00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
was 8.4 popped up second faster or

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.910 
was 8.4 popped up second faster or
something<00:01:07.970> which<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> nice<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.650> may

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
something which is nice because that may

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.810 
something which is nice because that may
mean<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.540> snappier

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
mean that it is a little bit snappier

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.780 
mean that it is a little bit snappier
not<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:15.090> any<00:01:16.080> big<00:01:16.500> difference<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.549> know

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
not by any big difference but you know

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.630 
not by any big difference but you know
that<00:01:18.630> could<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.409> know<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.460> can

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that could be good to know so you can

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.679 
that could be good to know so you can
see<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> about<00:01:22.020> tab<00:01:23.630> 8.4<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
see here when we go to about tab 8.4 and

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:36.630 
see here when we go to about tab 8.4 and
8.3<00:01:31.700> sweet

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.539 

let's<00:01:37.640> see<00:01:37.790> here<00:01:38.000> maybe<00:01:38.180> we<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:39.310> fire<00:01:40.310> up<00:01:40.340> some

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
let's see here maybe we can fire up some

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:55.359 
let's see here maybe we can fire up some
things<00:01:41.000> as<00:01:41.210> well

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:05.730 

well

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
so you can of course judge for yourself

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.860 
so you can of course judge for yourself
if<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.250> see<00:02:10.610> any<00:02:11.569> difference<00:02:16.090> both<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.750> know

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
dr. Forrest is getting slower you can

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.809 
dr. Forrest is getting slower you can
even<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:21.019> both<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.819> struggling
