my way so I use my ring finger to sigh
down<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.690> tip<00:02:26.989> for<00:02:27.200> it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
down to tip for it

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.390 
down to tip for it
so<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.580> pluck<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.950> once<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.569> another<00:02:32.569> time

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
so you pluck it once and another time

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:42.610 
so you pluck it once and another time
this<00:02:34.400> all<00:02:34.610> sounds<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:36.730> like<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.470> you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
this all sounds like like that so you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.930 
this all sounds like like that so you
move<00:02:42.800> your<00:02:43.160> finger<00:02:43.430> down<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.420> eighth<00:02:44.989> fret

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
move your finger down to the eighth fret

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.380 
move your finger down to the eighth fret
and<00:02:46.940> plug<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.330> twice

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.510 

and<00:02:52.390> when<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.870> go<00:02:52.990> down<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.860> set<00:02:54.220> for<00:02:54.460> it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
and when you go down to the set for it

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:06.660 
and when you go down to the set for it
you<00:02:55.120> plug<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.680> twice<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.860> fast<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.370> go<00:03:06.460> down

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
you plug it twice as fast we can go down

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.500 
you plug it twice as fast we can go down
to<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.880> fifth<00:03:07.180> fret<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.780> click<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.170> once

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
to a fifth fret you click it once

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.200 
to a fifth fret you click it once
so<00:03:10.170> altogether

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.790 

look<00:03:15.480> at<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.690> twice<00:03:18.960> but<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
look at so you do it twice but the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.310 
look at so you do it twice but the
second<00:03:20.130> time<00:03:20.280> sounds<00:03:20.760> different<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:21.990> of

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
second time sounds different because of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.770 
second time sounds different because of
the<00:03:22.410> plugin<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.790> put<00:03:27.060> my<00:03:27.150> ring<00:03:27.330> finger<00:03:27.630> on

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the plugin so I put my ring finger on

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.890 
the plugin so I put my ring finger on
the<00:03:27.870> ninth<00:03:28.110> fret<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:29.240> slide<00:03:30.240> outs<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.660> tip

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the ninth fret and a slide outs you tip

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.230 
the ninth fret and a slide outs you tip
instead<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.890> starting<00:03:32.520> up<00:03:32.610> here<00:03:32.820> again<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
instead of starting up here again and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.110 
instead of starting up here again and
slide<00:03:34.020> out<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.410> tip<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.540> plug<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.050> once

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
slide out and tip so you plug it once

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.020 
slide out and tip so you plug it once
again<00:03:39.470> then<00:03:40.470> go<00:03:40.680> down<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:42.110> eighth<00:03:43.110> fret

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
again then go down to the eighth fret

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.820 
again then go down to the eighth fret
like<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.180> twice<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.690> fast<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.670> fret

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
like it twice as fast and fret

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.330 
like it twice as fast and fret
for<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:52.700> once<00:03:53.700> owned<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.240> there<00:03:54.420> fret<00:03:55.340> so

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
for it once owned it there fret so

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:06.200 
for it once owned it there fret so
together<00:03:56.880> sounds<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.270> this<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.940> part

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
together sounds like this and that part

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:18.250 
together sounds like this and that part
