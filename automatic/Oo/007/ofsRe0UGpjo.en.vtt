my kids or my family you know but we're

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.700 
my kids or my family you know but we're
operating<00:01:14.480> under<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.020> assumption<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.500> the

operating under the assumption that the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
but there are situations that we plan

but there are situations that we plan
for<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.380> are<00:01:21.470> outside<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:21.950> rule<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.490> law<00:01:22.610> you

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
for that are outside the rule of law you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.880 
for that are outside the rule of law you
know<00:01:23.300> because<00:01:23.750> there<00:01:23.870> might<00:01:24.080> be<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.320> man<00:01:24.590> it
