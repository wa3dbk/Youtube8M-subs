00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.870
 good eyes antonio hermida and here I 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.660
 you have I am going to introduce my new 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.350
 pump the new measuring pump that is the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.200
 big seven that comes to be the 27 up 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.329
 now we knew 26 and 29 and they are 27 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.960
 where we can see the new wheels of 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:28.770
 fulcrum with some super bearings 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.220
 sensitive as you can see the wheel the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.320
 back be fantastic this year 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.780
 we also have incorporated as 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.350
 our rock shox sponsors with the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.170
 27 fork missing some prototype 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.199
 that we would have the head of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.719
 carbon suspension fork 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.460
 as an important fact also that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.820
 you can see here on the handlebar 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 cockpit that we would say you can see that there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.010
 few things this is because we are 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.929
 using the 1 by 11 is the new system 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.839
 of changes grip shift 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.820
 in my case you can see where I have the 11 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.740
 marches here I can upload and download with 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 all nature 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 and the left part I do not already have the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.500
 change that we had before for the double 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.930
 the plate we do not have anymore and the only thing 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.479
 I have is the button for blocking 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.479
 the suspension more means we throw for 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.700
 back the back we have also 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.590
 suffered some change starting with the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 saddle this year we have incorporated 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.659
 prologue one of the great manufacturers 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.390
 of saddles in the world and we're 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.679
 testing right now this system that is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.440
 a kind of rubber velcro where we 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.720
 allows us to have a lot of grip and that we do not 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.479
 we move a lot in the saddle and at the same time 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.459
 time is anti vibration and good is a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.650
 system that we are testing at the same 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:55.350
 time that the carbon rails 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.300
 As you can see they are not aluminum anymore 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.120
 prologue is carbon that makes the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 Saddle is somewhat lighter working 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.630
 for the bottom of the bicycle 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.170
 we can see the system 1 by 11 as 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.600
 you can see the pine nuts are great 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.090
 to compensate for the lack of a dish 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 we have a big pinions the change 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.180
 it's the typical 1 for 11 that is a change 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.730
 aesthetically very beautiful where the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.390
 secret that we have is the enormous tension 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.550
 that exercises the dock to have the 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.130
 chain always thought and that we do not 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.280
 Skip the chain as a very curious part 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.930
 we have the front where you can 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.520
 see that we're just going to use a plate 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.310
 also if we see it from up here 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.040
 also the feeling is quite 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.630
 special because we do not have anything here 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.370
 this will also facilitate that in days of 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.220
 a lot of mud 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.659
 in races of very wet then always 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.269
 we were loaded here the mud and 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.370
 we thought the bike will weigh less and 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.489
 same time as with just one plate 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.349
 we can make a single plate forward and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.420
 11 pine nuts behind we can do all 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.329
 the marches that we had before with two 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.989
 front and ten behind a very box 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.959
 characteristic is the back of 27 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.019
 where we can see some forms like this very 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.019
 pretty, very stylized but it's not 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.140
 only style but they are some pods 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.450
 that we say in Spain the pods and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.670
 back flexes 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.910
 making the picture pretty 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.670
 quite comfortable but still keeping 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.640
 a lot of stiffness due to the large amount 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.260
 of carbon that we have in the part of the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.650
 transmission and that this is all 27 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.519
 it will be the 2013 bike to follow us because 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.450
 will give a lot to talk about 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.450
 a greeting
