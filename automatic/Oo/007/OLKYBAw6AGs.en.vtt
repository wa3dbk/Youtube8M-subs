00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.980 

you<00:00:42.180> need<00:00:42.330> to<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.780> Rubik's<00:00:43.260> Cube<00:00:44.840> then<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
you need to get a Rubik's Cube then you

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.930 
you need to get a Rubik's Cube then you
need<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> hard<00:00:46.770> flat<00:00:47.130> item<00:00:47.580> of<00:00:47.700> some

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
need to get a hard flat item of some

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.730 
need to get a hard flat item of some
sort<00:00:48.240> like<00:00:48.630> a<00:00:49.610> dime<00:00:50.720> or<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.780> nickel<00:00:52.340> or<00:00:53.340> a

sort like a dime or a nickel or a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.790 
sort like a dime or a nickel or a
quarter<00:00:56.960> personally<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.110> like<00:00:58.380> using<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
quarter personally I like using a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.670 
quarter personally I like using a
quarter<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> best<00:00:59.580> because<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.270> big

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
quarter the best because it's really big

once you have all your materials then

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
once you have all your materials then
you<00:01:03.330> can<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.630> started<00:01:04.110> first<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:05.220> your

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you can get started first take your

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.180 
you can get started first take your
rubik's<00:01:05.820> cube<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> twist<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> top<00:01:07.530> part<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
rubik's cube and twist the top part at a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.460 
rubik's cube and twist the top part at a
40<00:01:08.880> degree<00:01:08.910> angle<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.440> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
40 degree angle you don't know what that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.060 
40 degree angle you don't know what that
means

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
means

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
means
just<00:01:11.400> need<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.910> flat<00:01:12.240> metal<00:01:12.479> part

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
just need to get the flat metal part

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.170 
just need to get the flat metal part
aligned<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.280> pointy<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.940> here

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.010 
aligned with the pointy part right here
the<00:01:15.479> corner<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:17.360> second<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> need<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.780> grab

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the corner in second you need to grab

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.650

stick<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.800> here<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.910> between<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.140> flat

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
stick it right here in between the flat

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.999 
stick it right here in between the flat
and<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.800> point<00:01:26.580> part<00:01:27.500> then<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.830> sure<00:01:28.860> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and the point part then make sure it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.620 
and the point part then make sure it's
in<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.550> tight<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.119> push<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
once you took out the first piece you're

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.930 
once you took out the first piece you're
able<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.540> take<00:01:40.720> out<00:01:40.870> all<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.470> squares<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:42.160> the

able to take out all the squares of the
whole<00:01:43.150> Rubik<00:01:43.570> period<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:52.750> want<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:52.990> taking

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
whole Rubik period don't want you taking

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.410 
whole Rubik period don't want you taking
out<00:01:53.350> all<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.470> pieces<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.490> all<00:01:54.910> it's<00:01:55.120> left

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
out all the pieces this is all it's left

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.780 
out all the pieces this is all it's left
that's<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.130> middle<00:01:57.430> center

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
that's right this is the middle center

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.230 
that's right this is the middle center
of<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.840> whole<00:01:59.050> rubik's<00:01:59.440> cube<00:01:59.820> now<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:00.880> see

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
of the whole rubik's cube now you see

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.270 
of the whole rubik's cube now you see
there's<00:02:01.450> all<00:02:01.720> these<00:02:01.960> colors<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.620> those<00:02:03.100> are

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
there's all these colors there those are

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.400 
there's all these colors there those are
the<00:02:03.340> middle<00:02:03.640> parts<00:02:04.120> of<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.780> whole<00:02:05.020> rubik's

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
the middle parts of the whole rubik's

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.560 
the middle parts of the whole rubik's
cube<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.310> remember<00:02:06.760> once<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.210> was<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.330> big

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
cube if you remember once it was a big

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.560 
cube if you remember once it was a big
block<00:02:07.900> there's<00:02:08.440> one<00:02:08.800> right<00:02:09.040> in<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.190> center

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
block there's one right in the center

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.860 
block there's one right in the center
that<00:02:10.570> never<00:02:10.960> moved<00:02:11.640> well<00:02:12.640> that's<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.660> right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that never moved well that's it right

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.580 
that never moved well that's it right
there<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.180> once<00:02:16.390> you've<00:02:16.540> gotten<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.959> far<00:02:17.230> on

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
there so once you've gotten this far on

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.400 
there so once you've gotten this far on
the<00:02:17.920> river<00:02:18.130> scoop<00:02:18.400> time<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.090> solvent<00:02:19.660> all<00:02:20.110> you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the river scoop time is solvent all you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.590 
the river scoop time is solvent all you
have<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.580> all<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.820> pieces<00:02:22.000> just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
have to do is get all your pieces just

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.110 
have to do is get all your pieces just
put<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> right<00:02:23.410> order<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.850> first

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
put it in the right order the first

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.910 
put it in the right order the first
couple<00:02:25.450> tries<00:02:25.660> putting<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.230> might<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.650> kind

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
couple tries putting it in might be kind

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.620 
couple tries putting it in might be kind
of<00:02:26.980> hard<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:27.550> once<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.030> start<00:02:28.360> getting<00:02:28.450> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
of hard but once you start getting the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.960 
of hard but once you start getting the
hang<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.260> really<00:02:29.380> easy<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.820> put

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
hang of it it's really easy you just put

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
hang of it it's really easy you just put
it<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.240> all<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> colors<00:02:31.810> well<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.500> how

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
it in with all the colors well I see how

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.370 
it in with all the colors well I see how
this<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:32.980> yellow<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:34.390> get<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> yellow<00:02:35.050> piece

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
this is yellow you get a yellow piece

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.470 
this is yellow you get a yellow piece
and<00:02:35.590> put<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:35.950> right<00:02:36.730> here<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.940> green<00:02:37.180> too

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and put it in right here is green too

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.330 
and put it in right here is green too
she<00:02:37.840> matched<00:02:38.020> up<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.380> green<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.830> here's

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
she matched up with the green and here's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.699 
she matched up with the green and here's
the<00:02:39.459> red<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.000> here's<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.270> red<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.720> me<00:02:41.470> line<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
the red and here's a red to me line it

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.410 
the red and here's a red to me line it
up<00:02:41.920> your<00:02:42.340> will<00:02:42.459> put<00:02:42.610> all<00:02:42.790> pieces<00:02:43.090> back

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
up your will put all pieces back

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.620 
up your will put all pieces back
together<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:44.470> make<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.769> one<00:02:45.160> huge<00:02:45.850> Rubik's

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
together to make it one huge Rubik's

00:02:46.630 --> 00:03:14.910 
together to make it one huge Rubik's
Cube

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.180 

you
