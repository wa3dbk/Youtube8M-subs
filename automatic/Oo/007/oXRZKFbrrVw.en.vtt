00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
like a one hit kill every time I feel

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889

like<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.640> same<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.180> sniper<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899

like<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> only<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.460> isn't<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
like the only time it isn't is if the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
like the only time it isn't is if the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
game because it's so fast-paced when you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.340 
game because it's so fast-paced when you
want<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.820> be<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.660> sit<00:03:21.900> back<00:03:22.079> and
