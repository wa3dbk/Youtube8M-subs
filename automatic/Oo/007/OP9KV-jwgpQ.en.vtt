here<00:00:08.780> we<00:00:09.019> have<00:00:09.290> the<00:00:09.710> fly<00:00:10.010> line<00:00:10.309> tethered

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
here we have the fly line tethered

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.320 
here we have the fly line tethered
radio-controlled<00:00:12.530> model<00:00:13.309> airplane<00:00:13.639> and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
radio-controlled model airplane and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.900 
radio-controlled model airplane and
here's<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:14.959> box<00:00:15.529> that<00:00:15.799> the<00:00:15.949> Mustang<00:00:16.369> came<00:00:16.609> in

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
here's the box that the Mustang came in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
here's the box that the Mustang came in
and<00:00:17.859> here's<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.130> Spitfire

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.409 

here's<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.660> aircraft<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.859> Mustang<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:27.240> its

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
here's the aircraft the Mustang with its

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.600 
here's the aircraft the Mustang with its
two<00:00:27.660> batteries<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:29.490> Spitfire<00:00:31.340> here<00:00:32.340> are

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
two batteries and the Spitfire here are

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.110 
two batteries and the Spitfire here are
the<00:00:32.820> transmitters<00:00:33.449> and<00:00:33.920> then<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> lines<00:00:35.340> go

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the transmitters and then the lines go

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.610 
the transmitters and then the lines go
to<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:37.110> hooks<00:00:38.690> let's<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:39.900> on<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> base

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to the hooks let's go on to the base

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.310 
to the hooks let's go on to the base
which<00:00:40.980> I'll<00:00:41.190> show<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.400> later<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
which I'll show you later the

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.920 
which I'll show you later the
transmitter<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.710> throttle<00:00:47.100> control<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
transmitter has the throttle control and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.520 
transmitter has the throttle control and
elevator<00:00:51.930> control<00:00:56.690> in<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> case<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.320> have

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
elevator control in this case we have

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.500 
elevator control in this case we have
power<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:00.359> there's<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.559> adjust<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
power on and there's we can adjust this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.029 
power on and there's we can adjust this
to<00:01:05.270> higher<00:01:06.270> power<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.050> faster<00:01:07.619> elevator

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
to higher power and faster elevator

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.840 
to higher power and faster elevator
response<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.009> green<00:01:11.190> light<00:01:11.399> is<00:01:11.640> on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
