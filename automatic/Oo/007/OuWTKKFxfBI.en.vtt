00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
angels just lie down with their arms
stretch<00:01:16.799> make<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.250> metal<00:01:17.520> angels<00:01:17.909> because

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
stretch make some metal angels because

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.289 
stretch make some metal angels because
they<00:01:18.360> both<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.020> many<00:01:19.170> medals<00:01:20.270> boxer<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
they both have so many medals boxer I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.850 
they both have so many medals boxer I
think<00:01:21.600> has<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:21.960> twice<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.320> number<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
think has about twice the number of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
think has about twice the number of
reach<00:01:23.159> reach<00:01:23.790> still<00:01:24.060> has<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.420> five<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:24.869> six

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
reach reach still has like five or six

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.499 
reach reach still has like five or six
medals<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.220> varying<00:01:27.119> colors<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.490> reach

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
medals of varying colors and reach

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
medals of varying colors and reach
beatboxer<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.720> an<00:01:30.810> Oso<00:01:31.229> final<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.310> Reach<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
beatboxer and an Oso final so Reach is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
beatboxer and an Oso final so Reach is
certainly<00:01:33.450> capable<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.990> taking<00:01:34.170> boxer<00:01:34.680> out

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
certainly capable of taking boxer out

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
certainly capable of taking boxer out
here<00:01:35.130> although<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.060> been<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> while<00:01:36.540> since

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
here although it's been a while since

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.490 
here although it's been a while since
2002<00:01:37.850> there's<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.000> telling<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.659> which<00:01:40.290> one

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
2002 there's no telling of which one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
2002 there's no telling of which one
these<00:01:40.650> players<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.250> better<00:01:41.610> since<00:01:42.570> 2002

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
these players is better since 2002

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.670 
these players is better since 2002
because<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.369> styles<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.229> play<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
because the styles of play have just

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
because the styles of play have just
changed<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.329> reach<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
changed so much you see that reach is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.389 
changed so much you see that reach is
getting<00:01:49.049> ready<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> take<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:50.009> more

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
getting ready to take out some more

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
getting ready to take out some more

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
himself to taking down that a command

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.760 
himself to taking down that a command
center<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.599> yet<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.080> think<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:51.710> is

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
center just yet so I think this is

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.499 
center just yet so I think this is
actually<00:04:52.099> is<00:04:52.460> going<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.729> be<00:04:52.819> cleaned<00:04:53.150> up<00:04:53.300> by

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
actually is going to be cleaned up by

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.159 
actually is going to be cleaned up by
boxer<00:04:55.060> very<00:04:56.060> very<00:04:56.300> close<00:04:56.660> though<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:56.960> think

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
boxer very very close though I think

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.080 
boxer very very close though I think
that<00:04:57.530> reach<00:04:57.710> probably<00:04:58.190> should<00:04:58.880> have<00:04:58.940> been

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
that reach probably should have been

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.580 
that reach probably should have been
able<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.360> take<00:04:59.570> out<00:04:59.720> my<00:04:59.750> command<00:05:00.229> center<00:05:00.470> i'm

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
able to take out my command center i'm

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.350 
able to take out my command center i'm
sure<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.099> boxer<00:05:01.430> was<00:05:01.580> repairing<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.210> though

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
sure that boxer was repairing it though

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.499 
sure that boxer was repairing it though
with<00:05:03.110> those<00:05:03.289> SUVs<00:05:03.669> so<00:05:04.669> boxer<00:05:05.030> is<00:05:05.180> going<00:05:05.449> to

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
with those SUVs so boxer is going to

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.860 
with those SUVs so boxer is going to

middle has an observer with them or not

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.010 
middle has an observer with them or not
as<00:05:58.430> it<00:05:58.909> could<00:05:59.060> look<00:05:59.180> bad<00:05:59.240> for<00:05:59.419> each<00:05:59.750> if<00:05:59.930> he

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
as it could look bad for each if he

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.439 
as it could look bad for each if he
falls<00:06:00.380> into<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.680> mine<00:06:00.979> trap<00:06:01.310> yeah<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.150> does<00:06:02.300> have

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
falls into a mine trap yeah it does have

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.230 
falls into a mine trap yeah it does have
one<00:06:02.659> observer<00:06:03.080> in<00:06:03.259> here<00:06:03.469> so<00:06:03.880> Reach<00:06:04.880> is<00:06:04.909> going

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
one observer in here so Reach is going

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.570 
one observer in here so Reach is going
to<00:06:05.300> be<00:06:05.389> able<00:06:05.479> to<00:06:05.719> pick<00:06:06.080> off<00:06:06.289> the<00:06:07.070> mines<00:06:07.310> that

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
to be able to pick off the mines that

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.230 
to be able to pick off the mines that
are<00:06:07.789> being<00:06:08.090> late<00:06:08.360> everywhere<00:06:08.990> from<00:06:09.229> boxer

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
are being late everywhere from boxer

poor<00:06:11.240> zealot<00:06:11.690> goes<00:06:12.199> down<00:06:12.440> there<00:06:12.710> but<00:06:12.979> yeah

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
poor zealot goes down there but yeah

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.339 
poor zealot goes down there but yeah
breach<00:06:13.880> does<00:06:14.210> do<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.719> little<00:06:14.990> bit<00:06:15.110> of<00:06:15.139> mine

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
breach does do a little bit of mine

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.560 
breach does do a little bit of mine
clearing<00:06:15.680> here<00:06:15.860> just<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.610> stop<00:06:16.849> that<00:06:17.060> threat<00:06:17.270> I

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
clearing here just to stop that threat I

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.390 
clearing here just to stop that threat I
think<00:06:17.990> boxers<00:06:18.380> trying<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:18.770> take<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.099> entire

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
think boxers trying to take the entire

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.070 
think boxers trying to take the entire
right<00:06:19.759> side<00:06:19.789> of<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.210> map<00:06:20.419> at<00:06:20.570> this<00:06:20.719> point<00:06:20.960> he's

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
right side of the map at this point he's

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.580 
right side of the map at this point he's
trying<00:06:21.349> to<00:06:21.469> inch<00:06:21.620> his<00:06:21.710> way<00:06:21.800> down<00:06:22.219> to<00:06:22.820> the<00:06:23.590> seven

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
trying to inch his way down to the seven

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.629 
trying to inch his way down to the seven
o'clock<00:06:24.800> base<00:06:25.219> and<00:06:25.550> eventually<00:06:26.210> take<00:06:26.479> that

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
o'clock base and eventually take that

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.459 
o'clock base and eventually take that
i'm<00:06:28.639> not<00:06:28.820> sure<00:06:28.880> if<00:06:29.000> he<00:06:29.180> took<00:06:29.389> that<00:06:29.659> eight

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
i'm not sure if he took that eight

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.580 
i'm not sure if he took that eight
o'clock<00:06:30.889> nine<00:06:31.159> o'clock<00:06:31.190> base<00:06:31.729> yet<00:06:32.060> i<00:06:32.090> see<00:06:32.780> well

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
o'clock nine o'clock base yet i see well

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.159 
o'clock nine o'clock base yet i see well
oh<00:06:33.849> that's<00:06:34.849> just<00:06:35.000> a<00:06:35.180> vulture<00:06:35.539> down<00:06:35.719> there<00:06:35.990> i

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
oh that's just a vulture down there i

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.050 
oh that's just a vulture down there i
think<00:06:36.469> that<00:06:36.500> vulture<00:06:36.770> was<00:06:36.979> there<00:06:37.159> for<00:06:37.490> quite<00:06:37.940> a

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
think that vulture was there for quite a

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.090 
think that vulture was there for quite a
while<00:06:38.300> like<00:06:39.020> a<00:06:39.080> matter<00:06:39.349> of<00:06:39.440> minutes

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
while like a matter of minutes

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.490 
while like a matter of minutes
yeah<00:06:40.880> i<00:06:41.150> think<00:06:41.270> the<00:06:41.510> boxer<00:06:41.840> will<00:06:41.990> eventually

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
yeah i think the boxer will eventually

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.620 
yeah i think the boxer will eventually
try<00:06:42.800> to<00:06:42.830> take<00:06:43.130> that<00:06:43.160> lower<00:06:43.550> left<00:06:44.030> part<00:06:44.300> of<00:06:44.510> the

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
try to take that lower left part of the

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.470 
try to take that lower left part of the
map<00:06:44.870> he's<00:06:45.080> inching<00:06:45.290> towards<00:06:45.950> it<00:06:46.100> with<00:06:46.280> a<00:06:47.180> nice

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
map he's inching towards it with a nice

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.770 
map he's inching towards it with a nice
defensive<00:06:48.170> grid<00:06:48.500> of<00:06:49.000> troops<00:06:50.000> here<00:06:50.300> and<00:06:50.690> I'm

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
defensive grid of troops here and I'm

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.180 
defensive grid of troops here and I'm
really<00:06:51.080> surprised<00:06:51.470> he<00:06:51.620> hasn't<00:06:51.710> gone<00:06:51.920> for<00:06:52.160> a

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
really surprised he hasn't gone for a

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.130 
really surprised he hasn't gone for a
drop<00:06:52.460> or<00:06:52.640> something<00:06:52.970> it's<00:06:53.120> so<00:06:53.390> easy<00:06:53.690> to<00:06:53.870> drop

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
drop or something it's so easy to drop
