the<00:04:02.569> movie<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.870> not<00:04:03.079> before<00:04:03.530> just<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:05.390> i<00:04:05.420> think

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
the movie is not before just so i think

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.509 
the movie is not before just so i think
they<00:04:05.840> channeled<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.319> little<00:04:06.560> bit<00:04:06.739> between<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
they channeled a little bit between the

they channeled a little bit between the
face<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:08.000> hair<00:04:08.209> i<00:04:08.239> think<00:04:08.450> they<00:04:08.690> channeled

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
face and the hair i think they channeled

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.099 
face and the hair i think they channeled
a<00:04:09.109> little<00:04:09.349> bit<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.889> glenn<00:04:10.700> close's<00:04:11.109> Cruella
