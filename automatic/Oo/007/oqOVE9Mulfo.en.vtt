circle<00:00:27.390> buttons<00:00:28.220> what's<00:00:29.220> interesting<00:00:29.400> about

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
circle buttons what's interesting about

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
circle buttons what's interesting about
this<00:00:29.820> unit<00:00:30.090> though<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.750> those<00:00:30.869> who<00:00:31.050> don't

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this unit though for those who don't

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.830 
this unit though for those who don't
know<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:31.890> hand<00:00:32.130> side<00:00:32.239> there<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.570> an

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
know on the right hand side there is an

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
know on the right hand side there is an
interesting<00:00:34.050> 5<00:00:34.530> pendant<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.430> course

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
interesting 5 pendant which of course

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.850 
interesting 5 pendant which of course
isn't<00:00:35.880> MIDI<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> thought<00:00:37.530> well<00:00:37.680> let's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
isn't MIDI out so I thought well let's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.190 
isn't MIDI out so I thought well let's
see<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.550> controller<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.360> rather

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
see what this controller is like rather

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.660 
see what this controller is like rather
than<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.410> game<00:00:40.649> controller<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.399> has<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
than a game controller actually has a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
than a game controller actually has a
MIDI<00:00:41.879> controller<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.950> got

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
MIDI controller so well do now is got

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.299 
MIDI controller so well do now is got
this<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.440> MIDI<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.160> my

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
this thing up to my MIDI out of my

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.670 
this thing up to my MIDI out of my
million<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.210> axiom<00:00:48.719> 25<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.530> using

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
million of my axiom 25 which I'm using

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.430 
million of my axiom 25 which I'm using
over<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> MIDI<00:00:50.760> controller

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
over here just as a MIDI controller

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.590 
over here just as a MIDI controller
there<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> switch<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> unit<00:00:53.370> on

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.729 

alright<00:01:00.600> immediately<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> MIDI

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
alright immediately because the MIDI

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.229 
alright immediately because the MIDI
cable<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> plugged<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
cable is plugged in you can see that the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
cable is plugged in you can see that the
unit<00:01:03.390> over<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:03.690> doesn't<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> four

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
unit over here doesn't have the four

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
unit over here doesn't have the four
blinky<00:01:05.280> lights<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:05.729> realizes<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.240> not

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
blinky lights but realizes that's not

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.950 
blinky lights but realizes that's not
running<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.990> MIDI<00:01:07.290> mode<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.689> I've<00:01:09.780> done

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
running in MIDI mode and what I've done

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 
running in MIDI mode and what I've done
actually<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.409> patched<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> input<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:12.030> xm25

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
actually is patched the input of my xm25

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.620 
actually is patched the input of my xm25
through<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:14.010> ronin<00:01:14.310> MKS<00:01:14.729> 30<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.479> some

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
through to my ronin MKS 30 just for some

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
through to my ronin MKS 30 just for some
test<00:01:15.869> purposes<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> let's<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.430> ahead<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> see

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
test purposes and let's go ahead and see

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.390 
test purposes and let's go ahead and see
if<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> works

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.380 

while<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.490> can<00:01:27.610> immediately<00:01:27.790> hear<00:01:28.120> up<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
while you can immediately hear up the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.660 
while you can immediately hear up the
bat<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.020> this<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.670> touch-sensitive

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
bat is that this is a touch-sensitive

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:44.859 
bat is that this is a touch-sensitive
lost<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.750> sensitive<00:01:32.230> to<00:01:32.800> octave<00:01:33.160> keyboard

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.149 

there's<00:01:45.439> no<00:01:45.740> aftertouch<00:01:46.579> side<00:01:47.920> see<00:01:48.920> there's

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
there's no aftertouch side see there's

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.209 
there's no aftertouch side see there's
no<00:01:49.280> off<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.549> touchscreen<00:01:49.850> somebody<00:01:50.299> at<00:01:50.479> all

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
no off the touchscreen somebody at all

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.559 
no off the touchscreen somebody at all
what<00:01:52.219> about<00:01:52.250> these<00:01:52.579> interesting<00:01:53.000> controls<00:01:53.450> on

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
what about these interesting controls on

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.020 
what about these interesting controls on
the<00:01:53.689> side<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:54.079> well<00:01:54.549> in<00:01:55.549> order<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.819> do<00:01:55.880> that

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
the side here well in order to do that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.149 
the side here well in order to do that
we<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.479> put<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.750> camera<00:01:56.899> down<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.859> carry

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
we have to put the camera down and carry

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.359 
we have to put the camera down and carry
on<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:58.549> review<00:02:00.100> right<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.280> this

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
on with this review right so this

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.230 
on with this review right so this
control<00:02:01.759> on<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:01.969> side<00:02:02.119> here<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.090> it

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
control on the side here in that it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.359 
control on the side here in that it
actually<00:02:05.390> transmits<00:02:06.490> modulation<00:02:09.369> further

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
actually transmits modulation further

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.530 
actually transmits modulation further
you<00:02:10.519> go<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.819> left<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.239> hide<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
you go to the left to hide the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.380 
you go to the left to hide the
modulation<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> little<00:02:14.209> touch

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
modulation so the little touch

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.940 
modulation so the little touch
controller<00:02:14.840> for<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.200> game<00:02:15.410> even<00:02:15.799> though<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
controller for the game even though it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.380 
controller for the game even though it
seemed<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.519> was<00:02:16.670> wired<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> other<00:02:17.209> way

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
seemed like was wired the other way

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.970 
seemed like was wired the other way
starts<00:02:18.170> on<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> right

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.520 

sends<00:02:21.580> out<00:02:21.670> modulation<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.569> need<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> leave<00:02:23.410> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
sends out modulation I need to leave it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
sends out modulation I need to leave it
there

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.149 

so<00:02:27.750> incense<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.439> distance<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> a

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
so incense in distance it's a

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.679 
so incense in distance it's a
touch-sensitive<00:02:29.489> modulation<00:02:30.420> wheel

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
touch-sensitive modulation wheel

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.259 
touch-sensitive modulation wheel
interesting<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.640> started<00:02:32.879> experimenting

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
interesting then I started experimenting

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.970 
interesting then I started experimenting
with<00:02:33.480> some<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:33.780> other<00:02:33.870> buttons<00:02:34.079> I've<00:02:34.799> been

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
with some of the other buttons I've been

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.199 
with some of the other buttons I've been
quite<00:02:35.099> figured<00:02:35.400> out<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.790> does<00:02:36.030> yet

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
quite figured out what this does yet

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.670 
quite figured out what this does yet
because<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.569> seems<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.900> turn<00:02:37.019> combinations<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
because it seems to turn combinations of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.039 
because it seems to turn combinations of
these<00:02:37.829> lights<00:02:38.099> on<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.459> off<00:02:38.569> these<00:02:39.569> three<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.959> a

immediately<00:02:56.879> I<00:02:57.150> thought<00:02:57.329> these<00:02:57.540> would<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.989> MMC

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
immediately I thought these would be MMC

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800 
immediately I thought these would be MMC
transport<00:02:59.190> controls<00:02:59.609> but<00:02:59.879> they<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:00.599> seem

transport controls but they don't seem

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.990 
transport controls but they don't seem
to<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.049> because<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.650> find<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.069> logic<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.670> even

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
to be because I find up logic and even

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.430 
to be because I find up logic and even
though<00:03:03.090> I've<00:03:03.209> got<00:03:03.390> my<00:03:03.510> XM<00:03:03.840> here<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.139> can<00:03:04.319> get

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
though I've got my XM here and I can get

the<00:03:09.750> message<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.139> different<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.620> these<00:03:10.739> three

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the message is different so these three

keys are a little light so to get a

reading<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.690> 127<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:29.760> actually<00:04:30.120> remarkably

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
reading of 127 is actually remarkably

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.409 
reading of 127 is actually remarkably
light<00:04:30.990> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.889> touch<00:04:32.100> but<00:04:32.370> it's<00:04:32.850> not<00:04:33.000> bad<00:04:33.180> kind

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
light on the touch but it's not bad kind

light on the touch but it's not bad kind
of<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.570> synth<00:04:33.840> actually<00:04:34.229> feel<00:04:34.470> pretty<00:04:34.710> quickly

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.409 

but<00:04:41.280> with<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.550> addition<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.120> octave

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
but with the addition of the octave

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
pretty impressed it is a the keys feel a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.330 
pretty impressed it is a the keys feel a
little<00:05:04.229> cheap<00:05:04.410> oh<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.680> can<00:05:04.860> feel<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.190> is

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
little cheap oh you can feel this is

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.950 
little cheap oh you can feel this is
cheaper<00:05:05.669> plastic<00:05:06.060> than<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.270> often<00:05:06.510> get<00:05:06.660> on<00:05:06.780> on

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
cheaper plastic than you often get on on

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.420 
cheaper plastic than you often get on on
many<00:05:07.080> other<00:05:07.320> more<00:05:07.560> expensive<00:05:07.770> controllers

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
many other more expensive controllers

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.090 
many other more expensive controllers
but<00:05:08.910> at<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.090> price<00:05:09.270> point<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.870> think<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:10.950> is

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
but at that price point I think this is

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.130 
but at that price point I think this is
a<00:05:11.130> quite<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.760> powerful<00:05:12.030> accessory<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.960> think

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
a quite a powerful accessory and I think

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.630 
a quite a powerful accessory and I think
a<00:05:13.200> lot<00:05:13.410> of<00:05:13.440> people<00:05:13.740> will<00:05:13.860> be<00:05:13.950> buying<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:14.340> just

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
a lot of people will be buying this just

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.279 
a lot of people will be buying this just
and<00:05:14.820> mess<00:05:14.940> around<00:05:14.970> from<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.510> MIDI<00:05:15.750> perspective

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
and mess around from a MIDI perspective

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.400 
and mess around from a MIDI perspective
not<00:05:16.979> necessarily<00:05:17.490> at<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.640> rock<00:05:17.760> band<00:05:18.030> at<00:05:18.150> all

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
not necessarily at the rock band at all

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.240 
not necessarily at the rock band at all
