one of the most underused pools of
success<00:00:15.500> is<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.670> power<00:00:16.940> of<00:00:17.150> asking<00:00:18.279> there<00:00:19.279> is

success is the power of asking there is
power<00:00:19.790> in<00:00:20.270> asking<00:00:21.080> for<00:00:21.110> what<00:00:21.560> we<00:00:21.830> want<00:00:22.100> and<00:00:22.460> yet

very<00:00:23.990> few<00:00:24.170> of<00:00:24.680> us<00:00:24.800> use<00:00:25.610> that<00:00:25.939> power<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:27.050> its

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
very few of us use that power to its

very few of us use that power to its
full<00:00:27.500> potential<00:00:28.810> think<00:00:29.810> about<00:00:30.020> this<00:00:30.140> for<00:00:30.380> a

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
full potential think about this for a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.550 
full potential think about this for a
moment<00:00:31.029> we<00:00:32.029> didn't<00:00:32.480> ask<00:00:32.720> to<00:00:32.960> be<00:00:33.200> born

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
moment we didn't ask to be born

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.620 
moment we didn't ask to be born
nobody<00:00:34.010> did<00:00:34.280> but<00:00:35.210> as<00:00:35.420> soon<00:00:35.960> as<00:00:35.989> we<00:00:36.560> were<00:00:36.770> born

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
nobody did but as soon as we were born

nobody did but as soon as we were born
asking<00:00:38.630> was<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.470> very<00:00:40.010> first<00:00:40.460> thing<00:00:40.789> we

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
asking was the very first thing we

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.760 
asking was the very first thing we
learned<00:00:41.180> as<00:00:42.020> a<00:00:43.010> baby<00:00:43.430> if<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:44.210> were<00:00:44.570> hungry<00:00:45.079> or

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
learned as a baby if we were hungry or

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.770 
learned as a baby if we were hungry or
cold<00:00:45.850> or<00:00:46.960> sick<00:00:47.960> or<00:00:48.230> just<00:00:48.920> needed<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.879> new<00:00:50.030> diaper

we<00:00:51.699> instinctively<00:00:52.699> knew<00:00:53.090> what<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.750> do<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:55.010> just

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
we instinctively knew what to do we just

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.819 
we instinctively knew what to do we just
had<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.420> cry<00:00:57.640> nobody<00:00:58.640> taught<00:00:59.329> us<00:00:59.510> that<00:00:59.719> we<00:01:00.620> were

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
had to cry nobody taught us that we were

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.049 
had to cry nobody taught us that we were
too<00:01:01.609> young<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.940> learn<00:01:02.179> anyway<00:01:02.949> but<00:01:03.949> we<00:01:04.489> knew<00:01:04.760> as

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
too young to learn anyway but we knew as

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.520 
too young to learn anyway but we knew as
if<00:01:05.660> it<00:01:05.780> had<00:01:05.960> been<00:01:06.170> wired<00:01:06.740> into<00:01:07.610> us<00:01:07.760> that<00:01:08.630> all<00:01:09.110> we

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
if it had been wired into us that all we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.160 
if it had been wired into us that all we
needed<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.980> do<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.460> get<00:01:10.730> what<00:01:10.940> we<00:01:11.120> wanted<00:01:11.480> was

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
needed to do to get what we wanted was

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.810 
needed to do to get what we wanted was
ask<00:01:12.590> or<00:01:13.310> cry<00:01:14.180> as<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:14.930> were<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.380> case<00:01:15.820> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
ask or cry as it were in that case and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.710 
ask or cry as it were in that case and
get<00:01:17.780> what<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.320> wanted<00:01:18.619> we<00:01:18.799> did<00:01:19.000> our<00:01:20.000> parents

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
get what we wanted we did our parents

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.230 
get what we wanted we did our parents
were<00:01:21.079> very<00:01:21.770> good<00:01:22.040> at<00:01:22.220> understanding<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
were very good at understanding and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.499 
were very good at understanding and
responding<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.439> our<00:01:24.590> requests<00:01:25.520> otherwise

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
responding to our requests otherwise

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.310 
responding to our requests otherwise
they<00:01:27.380> wouldn't<00:01:27.680> get<00:01:27.829> much<00:01:28.100> sleep<00:01:28.310> anyway<00:01:29.320> but

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
they wouldn't get much sleep anyway but

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.160 
they wouldn't get much sleep anyway but
an<00:01:31.070> interesting<00:01:31.640> thing<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.299> as<00:01:32.780> time

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
an interesting thing is that as time

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.850 
an interesting thing is that as time
went<00:01:33.560> by<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.280> we<00:01:34.820> grew<00:01:35.000> older<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.659> seems<00:01:36.590> that

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
went by and we grew older it seems that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.149 
went by and we grew older it seems that
that<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.850> instinct<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.780> asking<00:01:39.500> for<00:01:39.770> what<00:01:39.979> we

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
that that instinct of asking for what we

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.249 
that that instinct of asking for what we
want<00:01:40.570> was<00:01:41.570> slowly<00:01:42.340> stamped<00:01:43.340> out<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.759> us<00:01:44.259> we

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
want was slowly stamped out of us we

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.670 
want was slowly stamped out of us we
were<00:01:45.530> made<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.700> feel<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.649> asking<00:01:48.649> for

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
were made to feel that asking for

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.060 
were made to feel that asking for
something<00:01:49.369> we<00:01:49.490> wanted<00:01:49.939> was<00:01:50.360> somehow<00:01:51.259> bad<00:01:51.710> or

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
something we wanted was somehow bad or

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.039 
something we wanted was somehow bad or
selfish<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:54.049> were<00:01:54.289> disturbing<00:01:55.280> somebody

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
selfish that we were disturbing somebody

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.620 
selfish that we were disturbing somebody
that<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.890> didn't<00:01:58.159> deserve<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.969> ask<00:01:59.210> for

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that we didn't deserve to ask for

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.590 
that we didn't deserve to ask for
anything<00:02:00.280> but<00:02:01.280> rather<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:02.240> should<00:02:02.270> be

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
anything but rather we should be

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.060 
anything but rather we should be
grateful<00:02:02.990> for<00:02:03.829> whatever<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.490> already<00:02:04.789> had<00:02:05.000> and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
grateful for whatever we already had and

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.670 
grateful for whatever we already had and
somehow<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:07.759> even<00:02:08.030> learned<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.600> take<00:02:08.960> pride<00:02:09.380> in

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
somehow we even learned to take pride in

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.810 
somehow we even learned to take pride in
not<00:02:10.610> asking<00:02:11.480> anybody<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:12.320> help<00:02:12.530> or<00:02:12.980> anything

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
not asking anybody for help or anything

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.979 
not asking anybody for help or anything
else<00:02:14.120> we<00:02:14.330> needed<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.860> think<00:02:16.640> about<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.120> how

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
else we needed now think about it how

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.700 
else we needed now think about it how
did<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.680> happen

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
did that happen

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.270 
did that happen
I<00:02:20.770> would<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.270> explore<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.590> power<00:02:23.950> of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
I would like to explore the power of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.940 
I would like to explore the power of
asking<00:02:24.550> with<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.840> next<00:02:26.230> few<00:02:26.440> weeks<00:02:26.620> in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
asking with you in the next few weeks in

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.150 
asking with you in the next few weeks in
the<00:02:27.010> next<00:02:27.310> few<00:02:27.490> videos<00:02:28.290> because<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.530> me<00:02:29.710> this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
the next few videos because to me this

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.960 
the next few videos because to me this
is<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> fascinating<00:02:31.320> lost<00:02:32.320> power<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.730> all

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
is a fascinating lost power that we all

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.470 
is a fascinating lost power that we all
need<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.360> relearn<00:02:35.230> how<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.950> use<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:37.450> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
need to relearn how to use because you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.410 
need to relearn how to use because you
would<00:02:37.780> get<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.410> much<00:02:38.710> more<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.370> life<00:02:39.610> if<00:02:40.030> you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
would get so much more in life if you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.380 
would get so much more in life if you
would<00:02:40.540> only<00:02:40.660> learn<00:02:41.110> how<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.040> use<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.760> power<00:02:43.030> of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
would only learn how to use the power of

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.740 
would only learn how to use the power of
asking<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:45.190> for<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.850> would<00:02:46.090> like<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.540> ask

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
asking but for now I would like to ask

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.400 
asking but for now I would like to ask
you<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.740> two<00:02:47.980> things<00:02:48.220> number<00:02:48.850> one<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:50.350> week

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
you for two things number one this week

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.000 
you for two things number one this week
let's<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> little<00:02:51.580> exercise<00:02:52.320> try<00:02:53.320> going<00:02:53.680> out
