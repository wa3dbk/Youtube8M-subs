our<00:00:06.400> topic<00:00:06.820> for<00:00:06.850> today<00:00:07.030> is<00:00:07.600> if<00:00:07.840> microwave<00:00:08.620> food

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
our topic for today is if microwave food

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.000 
our topic for today is if microwave food
is<00:00:09.250> bad<00:00:09.760> or<00:00:10.150> dangerous<00:00:10.600> for<00:00:10.990> your<00:00:11.139> health<00:00:11.320> and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
is bad or dangerous for your health and

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.250 
is bad or dangerous for your health and
to<00:00:12.610> understand<00:00:13.059> this<00:00:13.210> topic<00:00:13.420> we<00:00:13.719> first<00:00:14.020> have

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
to understand this topic we first have

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.600 
to understand this topic we first have
to<00:00:14.290> put<00:00:14.620> in<00:00:14.830> a<00:00:15.070> bit<00:00:15.219> of<00:00:15.250> background

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
to put in a bit of background

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.880 
to put in a bit of background
information<00:00:16.030> and<00:00:16.630> that<00:00:16.870> is<00:00:17.020> how<00:00:17.260> microwave

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
information and that is how microwave

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.460 
information and that is how microwave
ovens<00:00:18.310> actually<00:00:18.970> work<00:00:19.360> and<00:00:19.660> as<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:20.320> name

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
ovens actually work and as the name

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.740 
ovens actually work and as the name
implies<00:00:20.890> a<00:00:21.250> microwave<00:00:22.060> works<00:00:22.420> with

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
implies a microwave works with

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.590 
implies a microwave works with
microwaves<00:00:23.470> which<00:00:23.830> are<00:00:24.600> electromagnetic

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
microwaves which are electromagnetic

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.320 
microwaves which are electromagnetic
waves<00:00:25.960> similar<00:00:26.950> to<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.250> waves<00:00:27.490> that<00:00:27.790> also<00:00:27.970> are

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
waves similar to the waves that also are

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.590 
waves similar to the waves that also are
used<00:00:28.660> in<00:00:28.960> television<00:00:29.580> broadcasting<00:00:30.580> when<00:00:31.480> you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
used in television broadcasting when you

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600 
used in television broadcasting when you
put<00:00:31.840> a<00:00:31.870> food<00:00:32.200> inside<00:00:32.710> your<00:00:32.950> microwave<00:00:33.129> and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
put a food inside your microwave and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.229 
put a food inside your microwave and
turns<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.059> on<00:00:34.210> these<00:00:34.950> electromagnetic<00:00:35.950> waves

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
turns it on these electromagnetic waves

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.180 
turns it on these electromagnetic waves
penetrate<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.629> food<00:00:37.989> you<00:00:38.199> put<00:00:38.230> inside<00:00:38.620> there

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
penetrate the food you put inside there

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.900 
penetrate the food you put inside there
and<00:00:40.440> interact<00:00:41.440> with<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:41.829> molecules<00:00:42.489> your

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
and interact with the molecules your

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.869 
and interact with the molecules your
food<00:00:43.300> consists<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.260> these<00:00:44.769> molecules<00:00:45.100> have<00:00:45.699> a

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
food consists of these molecules have a

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.169 
food consists of these molecules have a
magnetic<00:00:46.300> charge<00:00:46.539> -<00:00:47.199> and<00:00:47.499> the

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
magnetic charge - and the

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.790 
magnetic charge - and the
electromagnetic<00:00:49.179> waves<00:00:49.420> put<00:00:49.839> more<00:00:50.140> charge<00:00:50.530> on

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
electromagnetic waves put more charge on

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.009 
electromagnetic waves put more charge on
top<00:00:51.069> of<00:00:51.249> that<00:00:51.429> and<00:00:51.670> what<00:00:52.269> then<00:00:52.449> happens<00:00:52.839> is

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
top of that and what then happens is

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.919 
top of that and what then happens is
that<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:54.030> molecules<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.210> your<00:00:55.390> food<00:00:55.659> want<00:00:55.870> to

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
that the molecules of your food want to

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.500 
that the molecules of your food want to
get<00:00:56.170> rid<00:00:56.469> of<00:00:56.499> this<00:00:56.829> charge<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.489> they<00:00:58.059> start

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
get rid of this charge and they start

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.559 
get rid of this charge and they start
moving<00:00:59.079> and<00:00:59.559> through<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.370> moving<00:01:00.879> they<00:01:01.239> wrap

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
moving and through this moving they wrap

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.020 
moving and through this moving they wrap
against<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.289> molecules<00:01:02.800> next<00:01:03.429> to<00:01:03.550> them<00:01:03.760> and

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
against the molecules next to them and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.240 
against the molecules next to them and
you<00:01:04.510> know<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:04.900> when<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.199> wrap<00:01:05.470> your<00:01:05.680> hands

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
you know that when you wrap your hands

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.569 
you know that when you wrap your hands
your<00:01:06.940> hands<00:01:07.270> gets<00:01:07.720> warm<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:09.310> same

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
your hands gets warm and the same

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.730 
your hands gets warm and the same
happens<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.299> molecules<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:11.290> the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
happens to the molecules that the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.980 
happens to the molecules that the
charged<00:01:12.189> molecules<00:01:12.850> wrap<00:01:13.329> against<00:01:13.840> and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
charged molecules wrap against and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.889 
charged molecules wrap against and
through<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:15.100> way<00:01:15.340> warmth<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.180> heat<00:01:16.630> is

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
through that way warmth and heat is

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.160 
through that way warmth and heat is
spread<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.399> food<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:18.909> put<00:01:19.479> into<00:01:19.750> your

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
spread to the food you put into your

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.170 
spread to the food you put into your
microwave

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.390 

now<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.750> fear<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.320> some<00:01:27.530> people<00:01:27.860> have<00:01:28.130> is

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
now the fear is that some people have is

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.660 
now the fear is that some people have is
that<00:01:28.940> when<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.780> warm<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.650> food<00:01:30.920> inside<00:01:31.460> your

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
that when you warm the food inside your

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.250 
that when you warm the food inside your
microwave<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.840> some<00:01:33.140> left<00:01:33.470> over<00:01:33.980> of<00:01:34.190> these

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
microwave that some left over of these

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.630 
microwave that some left over of these
electromagnetic<00:01:36.260> waves<00:01:36.500> would<00:01:36.830> still<00:01:37.160> sit

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
electromagnetic waves would still sit

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.350 
electromagnetic waves would still sit
inside<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.300> food<00:01:39.610> similar<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.760> what<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.090> have

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
inside the food similar to what you have

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.690 
inside the food similar to what you have
when<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:41.900> expose<00:01:42.290> something<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.950> radioactive

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
when you expose something to radioactive

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.030 
when you expose something to radioactive
waves<00:01:44.000> which<00:01:44.720> will<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.290> become<00:01:45.500> radioactive

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
waves which will then become radioactive

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.510 
waves which will then become radioactive
as<00:01:46.640> well<00:01:46.910> but<00:01:47.480> that<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.750> not<00:01:47.900> how<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.620> microwaves

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
as well but that is not how a microwaves

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.000 
as well but that is not how a microwaves
work<00:01:50.030> when<00:01:50.630> they<00:01:50.780> are<00:01:50.810> turned<00:01:51.200> off<00:01:51.440> they<00:01:51.980> are

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
work when they are turned off they are

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.700 
work when they are turned off they are
gone<00:01:52.400> similar<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.690> have<00:01:53.960> when<00:01:54.440> you

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
gone similar to what you have when you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.340 
gone similar to what you have when you
turn<00:01:55.340> off<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.730> light<00:01:55.970> bulb<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:56.990> turn<00:01:57.200> off

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
turn off a light bulb and you turn off

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.010 
turn off a light bulb and you turn off
the<00:01:57.500> bulb<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.550> light<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.940> gone<00:01:59.150> there<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.750> no

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the bulb the light is gone there is no

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.270 
the bulb the light is gone there is no
left<00:02:00.920> over<00:02:01.430> light

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.150 

there<00:02:08.270> are<00:02:08.420> two<00:02:08.630> advantages<00:02:08.780> over<00:02:09.410> using<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
there are two advantages over using a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.910 
there are two advantages over using a
microwave<00:02:10.640> over<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.150> conventional<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.290> that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
microwave over a conventional and that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.190 
microwave over a conventional and that
is<00:02:13.040> because<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.670> microwave<00:02:14.270> uses<00:02:14.690> much<00:02:14.900> lower

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
is because a microwave uses much lower

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.190 
is because a microwave uses much lower
temperatures<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.069> heat<00:02:16.280> foods<00:02:16.640> compared<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.959> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
temperatures to heat foods compared to a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.650 
temperatures to heat foods compared to a
conventional<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.160> microwave<00:02:20.120> would<00:02:20.390> stay

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
conventional a microwave would stay

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.220 
conventional a microwave would stay
around<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.530> temperature<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.490> boiling<00:02:22.730> water

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
around the temperature of boiling water

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.170 
around the temperature of boiling water
while<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> conventional<00:02:25.370> oven<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.940> use

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180

and<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.830> will<00:04:47.010> eat<00:04:47.250> them<00:04:47.520> along<00:04:48.030> with<00:04:48.060> your

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
and you will eat them along with your

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.230 
and you will eat them along with your
food<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.800> bad<00:04:49.950> thing<00:04:50.190> about<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.700> is

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
food and the bad thing about that is

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.800 
food and the bad thing about that is
that<00:04:51.510> some<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.140> these<00:04:52.350> softeners<00:04:52.950> can<00:04:53.340> cause

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
that some of these softeners can cause

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.210 
that some of these softeners can cause
cancer<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.350> really<00:04:55.710> have<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.890> make<00:04:56.160> sure

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
cancer so you really have to make sure

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.370 
cancer so you really have to make sure
that<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.820> plastic<00:04:57.270> containers<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:58.140> use

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
that the plastic containers you use

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.710 
that the plastic containers you use
inside<00:04:58.770> your<00:04:58.980> microwave<00:04:59.160> are<00:04:59.720> microwave-safe

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
inside your microwave are microwave-safe

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.790 
inside your microwave are microwave-safe
and<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:02.220> can<00:05:02.400> easily<00:05:02.640> tell<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.360> by<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:04.290> little

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
and you can easily tell that by a little

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.850 
and you can easily tell that by a little
symbol<00:05:05.370> on<00:05:05.730> them<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.210> hope<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.260> camera<00:05:07.470> can

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
symbol on them I hope the camera can

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.050 
symbol on them I hope the camera can
catch<00:05:08.070> that<00:05:08.370> which<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:10.250> little<00:05:11.250> glass<00:05:11.730> and

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
catch that which is a little glass and

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.940 
catch that which is a little glass and
little<00:05:12.450> fork<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:12.990> can<00:05:13.050> see<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.440> on<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.740> left

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
little fork you can see it on the left

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.370 
little fork you can see it on the left
here<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.490> which<00:05:15.150> is<00:05:15.230> internationally<00:05:16.230> the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
here and which is internationally the

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.630 
here and which is internationally the
same<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:17.419> it's<00:05:18.419> used<00:05:18.870> on<00:05:19.200> containers<00:05:20.160> which

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
same and it's used on containers which

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.460 
same and it's used on containers which
are<00:05:20.669> safe<00:05:21.270> for<00:05:21.960> food<00:05:22.770> use<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:24.140> when<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.260> want

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
are safe for food use so when you want

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.409 
are safe for food use so when you want
to<00:05:25.530> use<00:05:25.740> those<00:05:25.950> plastic<00:05:26.190> containers<00:05:26.419> inside

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
to use those plastic containers inside

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.370 
to use those plastic containers inside
your<00:05:27.600> microwave

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
your microwave

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.720 
your microwave
make<00:05:28.740> sure<00:05:29.100> they<00:05:29.550> are<00:05:29.580> microwave<00:05:30.300> safe

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.460 

the<00:05:36.240> other<00:05:36.360> thing<00:05:36.600> we<00:05:36.720> have<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.870> be<00:05:36.990> careful

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
the other thing we have to be careful

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.400 
the other thing we have to be careful
about<00:05:37.560> is<00:05:38.100> that<00:05:38.610> how<00:05:39.360> deep<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.840> microwaves

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
about is that how deep the microwaves

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.830 
about is that how deep the microwaves
get<00:05:40.770> inside<00:05:41.160> your<00:05:41.370> food<00:05:41.630> depends<00:05:42.630> on<00:05:42.750> the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
get inside your food depends on the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.260 
get inside your food depends on the
foods<00:05:43.140> density<00:05:44.070> there<00:05:44.580> are<00:05:44.670> foods<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.030> have

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
foods density there are foods that have

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.450 
foods density there are foods that have
more<00:05:45.540> density<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.530> microwaves<00:05:47.100> will<00:05:47.340> get

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
more density and the microwaves will get

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.120 
more density and the microwaves will get
less<00:05:47.730> deep<00:05:48.030> while<00:05:48.570> as<00:05:48.930> our<00:05:49.290> foods<00:05:49.590> have<00:05:49.890> less

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
less deep while as our foods have less

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.460 
less deep while as our foods have less
density<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.570> microwaves<00:05:52.170> will

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
density and the microwaves will

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.070 
density and the microwaves will
penetrate<00:05:52.830> deeper<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.420> course<00:05:54.720> there<00:05:54.990> are

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
penetrate deeper and of course there are

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.410 
penetrate deeper and of course there are
foods<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.680> don't<00:05:56.520> have<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:56.880> same<00:05:57.120> density

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
foods that don't have the same density

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.630 
foods that don't have the same density
all<00:05:57.900> over<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.440> give<00:05:58.590> more<00:05:58.860> density<00:05:59.250> on<00:05:59.460> one

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
all over the give more density on one

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.850 
all over the give more density on one
side<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.270> less<00:06:00.420> on<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.720> other<00:06:00.780> which<00:06:01.620> means

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
side and less on the other which means

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.830 
side and less on the other which means
when<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.310> put<00:06:02.550> those<00:06:02.970> inside<00:06:03.450> your<00:06:03.630> microwave

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
when you put those inside your microwave

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.980 
when you put those inside your microwave
and<00:06:04.550> then<00:06:05.550> take<00:06:06.240> them<00:06:06.420> out<00:06:06.540> when<00:06:06.780> they<00:06:06.900> are

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
and then take them out when they are

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.350 
and then take them out when they are
warm<00:06:07.260> you'll<00:06:07.530> notice<00:06:08.010> that<00:06:08.310> some<00:06:08.820> spots<00:06:09.210> are

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
warm you'll notice that some spots are

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.720 
warm you'll notice that some spots are
really<00:06:09.570> hot<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.080> some<00:06:10.740> spots<00:06:11.100> are<00:06:11.430> really

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
really hot and some spots are really

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.270 
really hot and some spots are really
cold<00:06:12.000> still<00:06:12.330> and<00:06:12.600> the<00:06:13.290> bad<00:06:13.470> thing<00:06:13.710> about<00:06:13.740> that

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
cold still and the bad thing about that

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.460 
cold still and the bad thing about that
is<00:06:14.490> when<00:06:15.120> you<00:06:15.180> use<00:06:15.450> your<00:06:15.480> microwave<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.440> heat

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
is when you use your microwave to heat

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.520 
is when you use your microwave to heat
meat<00:06:17.220> and<00:06:17.550> this<00:06:18.450> happens<00:06:18.900> there<00:06:19.230> are<00:06:19.260> still

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
meat and this happens there are still

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.980 
meat and this happens there are still
those<00:06:19.680> hot<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.190> those<00:06:20.370> cold<00:06:20.880> spots<00:06:21.270> that<00:06:21.840> in

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
those hot and those cold spots that in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.290 
those hot and those cold spots that in
those<00:06:22.140> cold<00:06:22.530> spots<00:06:23.010> are<00:06:23.250> still<00:06:23.400> bacteria

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
those cold spots are still bacteria

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.590 
those cold spots are still bacteria
alive<00:06:24.900> which<00:06:25.800> can<00:06:26.070> harm<00:06:26.670> your<00:06:26.880> health<00:06:27.150> which

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
alive which can harm your health which

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.920 
alive which can harm your health which
are<00:06:27.750> normally<00:06:28.260> killed<00:06:28.620> through<00:06:29.430> heat<00:06:29.970> so<00:06:30.540> when

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
are normally killed through heat so when

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.380 
are normally killed through heat so when
you<00:06:31.050> use<00:06:31.260> your<00:06:31.290> microwave<00:06:31.920> to<00:06:32.430> heat<00:06:32.460> meat<00:06:33.060> then

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
you use your microwave to heat meat then

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.320 
you use your microwave to heat meat then
make<00:06:33.600> sure<00:06:33.900> it's<00:06:34.140> really<00:06:34.530> hot<00:06:35.130> all<00:06:35.400> over<00:06:35.940> and

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
make sure it's really hot all over and

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.810 
make sure it's really hot all over and
there<00:06:36.750> are<00:06:36.870> no<00:06:37.110> cold<00:06:37.530> spots<00:06:37.680> left<00:06:38.280> where<00:06:38.640> those

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
there are no cold spots left where those

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.080 
there are no cold spots left where those
pesky<00:06:39.150> bacterias<00:06:39.930> could<00:06:40.650> have<00:06:40.950> survived<00:06:41.670> you

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
pesky bacterias could have survived you

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:49.220 
pesky bacterias could have survived you
would<00:06:42.120> eat<00:06:42.570> them<00:06:42.810> along<00:06:43.410> with<00:06:43.440> the<00:06:43.920> meat

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.190 

as<00:06:49.290> you<00:06:50.160> can<00:06:50.280> see<00:06:50.490> microwave<00:06:51.240> food<00:06:51.540> won't<00:06:51.990> be

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
as you can see microwave food won't be

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.120 
as you can see microwave food won't be
bad<00:06:52.380> for<00:06:52.710> your<00:06:52.800> health

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
bad for your health

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.730 
bad for your health
and<00:06:53.250> you<00:06:53.730> can<00:06:53.910> safely<00:06:54.150> use<00:06:54.390> your<00:06:54.750> microwave<00:06:55.170> to

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
and you can safely use your microwave to

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.740 
and you can safely use your microwave to
warm<00:06:55.770> your<00:06:56.160> food<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:57.030> general<00:06:57.390> rule<00:06:57.720> that

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750
