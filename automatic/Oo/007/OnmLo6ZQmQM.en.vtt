react<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.720> what<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.740> really<00:01:09.920> want<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.280> do

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
react to that what I really want to do

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.560 
react to that what I really want to do
is<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:11.390> streamline<00:01:11.780> everything<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:12.800> make<00:01:13.160> it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
is to streamline everything and make it

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.480 
is to streamline everything and make it
so<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:14.869> actually<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.380> same<00:01:15.590> size<00:01:15.890> as<00:01:16.280> her

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
so it's actually the same size as her

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.300 
so it's actually the same size as her
other<00:01:16.700> hand<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:17.720> it<00:01:17.990> feels<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.740> fits<00:01:19.040> as<00:01:19.280> a

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
other hand so it feels like it fits as a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.820 
other hand so it feels like it fits as a
functional<00:01:19.850> part<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.180> her<00:01:20.270> body<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.780> knew<00:01:21.200> that

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
functional part of her body I knew that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.160 
functional part of her body I knew that
they<00:01:22.070> would<00:01:22.310> come<00:01:22.460> up<00:01:22.580> with<00:01:22.610> better<00:01:22.880> ideas

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
they would come up with better ideas

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170 
they would come up with better ideas
than<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> could<00:01:24.530> come<00:01:24.680> up<00:01:24.710> with<00:01:24.910> because<00:01:25.910> that's

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
than I could come up with because that's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.210 
than I could come up with because that's
what<00:01:26.509> our<00:01:26.780> young<00:01:27.170> people<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.680> our<00:01:27.770> students

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
what our young people and our students

do here UWM they come up with ideas that

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.609 
do here UWM they come up with ideas that
are<00:01:30.770> grand<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.690> brings<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.200> richness<00:01:33.380> to

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
are grand and that brings a richness to

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.030 
are grand and that brings a richness to
the<00:01:33.920> project<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.850> can't<00:01:35.270> on<00:01:36.020> tool<00:01:36.229> to

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
the project that I can't on tool to

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.830 
the project that I can't on tool to
although<00:01:37.220> some<00:01:37.640> ways<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.690> have<00:01:38.750> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
although some ways to do that to have a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.930 
although some ways to do that to have a
fresh<00:01:39.140> perspective<00:01:39.369> none<00:01:40.369> of<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.640> students

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
fresh perspective none of the students

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.720 
fresh perspective none of the students
have<00:01:41.090> ever<00:01:41.210> 3d<00:01:41.570> printed<00:01:41.990> none<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.430> this

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
have ever 3d printed none and so this

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.390 
have ever 3d printed none and so this
the<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.510> entire<00:01:44.690> production<00:01:45.350> process<00:01:45.770> is

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
the that entire production process is

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.830 
the that entire production process is
different<00:01:46.610> none<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.090> them<00:01:47.180> have<00:01:47.330> ever<00:01:47.420> used<00:01:47.690> a

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
different none of them have ever used a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.170 
different none of them have ever used a
foam<00:01:48.050> cutter<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:48.920> it's<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.550> really<00:01:49.730> fun
