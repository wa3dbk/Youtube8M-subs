we're starting right in the bottom half

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.799 
we're starting right in the bottom half
there<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> add<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> extra<00:00:42.649> attraction

also we have a wiggle wart it's kind of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
also we have a wiggle wart it's kind of
the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:47.520> idea<00:00:47.719> but<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.230> don't<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> put

tuna or starting back here just because

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
tuna or starting back here just because
it<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.870> ruin<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> action<00:00:53.480> ascent<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.690> will

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it will ruin the action ascent two will

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.260 
it will ruin the action ascent two will
work<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:54.989> fine<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.730> then<00:00:56.730> maybe<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> most

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
work just fine and then maybe the most

sure your weight line is less than any
other<00:01:28.829> lines<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.909> break<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> off<00:01:30.450> if

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
other lines so you can break it off if

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
other lines so you can break it off if
you<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.990> stuck<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> bottom<00:01:31.880> now<00:01:32.880> if

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
use a 65 pound braided line or a 40

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
use a 65 pound braided line or a 40
pound<00:01:38.040> monofilament<00:01:38.400> line<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.590> 4<00:01:40.590> liters<00:01:41.869> 20

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
pound monofilament line and 4 liters 20

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.880 
pound monofilament line and 4 liters 20
up<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.290> 40<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.100> work<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.280> fine<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.890> same

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
up to 40 will work just fine and same

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.710 
up to 40 will work just fine and same
idea<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.520> weight<00:01:47.729> weight<00:01:48.270> line<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> make

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
idea for the weight weight line is make

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
idea for the weight weight line is make
sure<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.049> break<00:01:49.259> off<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:50.640> lose

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
sure it can break off and you don't lose
