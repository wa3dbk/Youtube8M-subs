00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
zombies but then that leads into the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.440 
zombies but then that leads into the

much<00:03:08.860> technology<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> exosuits<00:03:10.630> in

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
much technology and the exosuits in

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.660 
much technology and the exosuits in
advanced<00:03:11.170> warfare<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:12.040> me<00:03:12.190> it's<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.489> very

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
advanced warfare to me it's just very

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.130 
advanced warfare to me it's just very
plausible<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.510> type<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> thing<00:03:14.019> could

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
plausible that that type of thing could

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.690 
plausible that that type of thing could
happen<00:03:14.320> especially<00:03:14.560> with<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> things<00:03:15.550> that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
happen especially with the things that

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.220 
happen especially with the things that
we've<00:03:15.790> seen<00:03:15.970> from<00:03:16.180> Michael<00:03:16.510> cond<00:03:16.690> retweet<00:03:17.080> out

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
we've seen from Michael cond retweet out

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.259 
we've seen from Michael cond retweet out
just<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.890> give<00:03:18.010> hints<00:03:18.220> here<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.580> there<00:03:18.760> he<00:03:19.090> has

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
just to give hints here and there he has

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.540 
just to give hints here and there he has
put<00:03:19.540> out<00:03:19.600> articles<00:03:19.840> relating<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.739> cyborgs<00:03:21.459> and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
put out articles relating to cyborgs and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.460 
put out articles relating to cyborgs and
the<00:03:21.670> implementation<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.900> much<00:03:23.050> technology

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the implementation of so much technology

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.320 
the implementation of so much technology
in<00:03:23.800> our<00:03:23.860> lives<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:24.400> aren't<00:03:24.760> actually

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
in our lives that we aren't actually

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.660 
in our lives that we aren't actually
what<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.019> would<00:03:26.170> call<00:03:26.320> human<00:03:26.680> but<00:03:27.190> partially

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
what we would call human but partially

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.610 
what we would call human but partially
half<00:03:27.880> technology<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.049> case<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.530> can

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
half technology and in that case it can

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.770 
half technology and in that case it can
be<00:03:29.769> very<00:03:30.010> dangerous<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.670> articles<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.540> that

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
be very dangerous so articles like that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.780 
be very dangerous so articles like that
not<00:03:32.290> only<00:03:32.410> catch<00:03:32.739> my<00:03:32.920> attention<00:03:32.950> but<00:03:33.549> also

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
not only catch my attention but also

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.360 
not only catch my attention but also
spark<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.480> imagination<00:03:34.570> here<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.190> game

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
spark the imagination here for the game

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.430 
spark the imagination here for the game
and<00:03:36.400> what<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:36.850> could<00:03:37.150> see<00:03:37.390> but<00:03:37.660> along<00:03:38.290> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
and what we could see but along the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.350 
and what we could see but along the
lines<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.829> when<00:03:39.310> we<00:03:39.459> could<00:03:39.640> see<00:03:39.880> something

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
lines of when we could see something

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.420 
lines of when we could see something
that<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.750> think<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.380> bigger<00:03:41.650> topic<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.340> we

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
that I think is the bigger topic that we

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.610 
that I think is the bigger topic that we
have<00:03:42.640> more<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.120> grasp<00:03:43.420> on<00:03:43.660> actually<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.290> terms

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
have more to grasp on actually in terms

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.920 
have more to grasp on actually in terms
of<00:03:44.739> an<00:03:44.950> actual<00:03:45.220> video<00:03:45.610> trailer<00:03:46.060> reveal<00:03:46.510> let's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
of an actual video trailer reveal let's

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.060 
of an actual video trailer reveal let's
take<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.110> look<00:03:47.260> at<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.380> last<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.709> call<00:03:47.920> of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
take a look at the last to call of

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.680 
take a look at the last to call of
duty's<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.430> determine<00:03:48.850> when<00:03:49.090> we<00:03:49.239> could<00:03:49.450> see

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
duty's to determine when we could see

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.080 
duty's to determine when we could see
something<00:03:49.930> call<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.470> duty<00:03:50.769> black<00:03:50.950> ops<00:03:51.070> 2<00:03:51.579> had

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
something call of duty black ops 2 had

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.940 
something call of duty black ops 2 had
their<00:03:52.299> zombies<00:03:52.720> reveal<00:03:53.049> trailer<00:03:53.350> released<00:03:53.739> on

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
their zombies reveal trailer released on

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.060 
their zombies reveal trailer released on
September<00:03:54.489> 26<00:03:55.120> 2012<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.230> then<00:03:56.620> ghost<00:03:56.860> was<00:03:57.040> a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
September 26 2012 and then ghost was a

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.319 
September 26 2012 and then ghost was a
little<00:03:57.310> bit<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.489> an<00:03:57.579> oddball<00:03:57.760> with<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
little bit of an oddball with the

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.150 
little bit of an oddball with the
extinction<00:03:58.840> revealed<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.320> actual<00:03:59.739> trailer

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
extinction revealed the actual trailer

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.180 
extinction revealed the actual trailer
for<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.790> video<00:04:00.970> reveal<00:04:01.540> worldwide<00:04:02.440> was

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
for that the video reveal worldwide was

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.259 
for that the video reveal worldwide was
on<00:04:03.430> October<00:04:04.180> 28th<00:04:05.040> 2013<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.340> if<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:06.880> guys<00:04:07.030> do

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
on October 28th 2013 so if you guys do

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.880 
on October 28th 2013 so if you guys do
remember<00:04:07.540> that's<00:04:07.750> only<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.230> week<00:04:08.320> before

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
remember that's only like a week before

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.009 
remember that's only like a week before
the<00:04:09.220> game<00:04:09.459> was<00:04:09.670> launched<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:10.540> actually

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
the game was launched that is actually

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.870 
the game was launched that is actually
very<00:04:11.049> unorthodox<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:12.280> Call<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.489> Duty<00:04:12.760> who

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
very unorthodox for Call of Duty who

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.100 
very unorthodox for Call of Duty who
would<00:04:13.000> normally<00:04:13.239> do<00:04:13.600> an<00:04:13.690> announcement

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
would normally do an announcement

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.409 
would normally do an announcement
sometime<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:14.829> late<00:04:14.860> September<00:04:15.670> or<00:04:15.850> very<00:04:16.180> early

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
sometime in late September or very early

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.050 
sometime in late September or very early
October<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.620> assuming<00:04:18.430> there<00:04:18.579> won't<00:04:18.789> be<00:04:18.880> as

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
October so assuming there won't be as

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.909 
October so assuming there won't be as
much<00:04:19.299> mystery<00:04:19.720> surrounding<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.500> game<00:04:20.709> mode

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
much mystery surrounding the game mode

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.460 
much mystery surrounding the game mode
as<00:04:21.130> there<00:04:21.489> was<00:04:21.700> in<00:04:21.729> ghosts<00:04:22.390> I'm<00:04:22.840> expecting

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
as there was in ghosts I'm expecting

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.920 
as there was in ghosts I'm expecting
some<00:04:23.500> sort<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:24.010> reveal<00:04:24.370> late<00:04:25.060> next<00:04:25.330> month<00:04:25.479> or

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
some sort of reveal late next month or

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.110 
some sort of reveal late next month or
early<00:04:26.110> october<00:04:26.320> we're<00:04:27.070> getting<00:04:27.400> closer<00:04:27.760> but

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
early october we're getting closer but

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.400 
early october we're getting closer but
we<00:04:28.240> still<00:04:28.479> do<00:04:28.660> have<00:04:28.690> some<00:04:29.020> time<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.380> think

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
we still do have some time to think

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.529 
we still do have some time to think
about<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.190> terms<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.760> teases<00:04:31.120> i<00:04:31.240> think<00:04:31.450> we

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
about it in terms of teases i think we

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.390 
about it in terms of teases i think we
could<00:04:31.750> get<00:04:31.900> something<00:04:32.200> here<00:04:32.800> there<00:04:33.099> from

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
could get something here there from

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.159 
could get something here there from
michel<00:04:33.700> gondry<00:04:34.060> again<00:04:34.390> he<00:04:34.539> likes<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.840> do<00:04:34.990> that

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
michel gondry again he likes to do that

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.530 
michel gondry again he likes to do that
kind<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.380> stuff<00:04:35.500> but<00:04:36.039> as<00:04:36.220> an<00:04:36.430> actual<00:04:36.760> reveal

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
kind of stuff but as an actual reveal

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.820 
kind of stuff but as an actual reveal
that<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:37.810> actually<00:04:38.110> get<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.230> see<00:04:38.410> everything

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
that we actually get to see everything

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.830 
that we actually get to see everything
played<00:04:39.280> out<00:04:39.310> for<00:04:39.700> us<00:04:39.790> like<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.330> said<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.570> would

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
played out for us like I said I would

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.240 
played out for us like I said I would
again<00:04:41.110> think<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.560> would<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.800> late-september

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
again think that would be late-september
