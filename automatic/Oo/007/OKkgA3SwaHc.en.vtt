00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.000
 hi everyone in this video I want with you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.849
 share how i wash all glass 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.849
 and mirror surfaces in your home 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.789
 for this I use this little thing and 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.609
 i use liquid liquid like this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.760
 I can't say anything to me therefore 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.310
 bought what was in the store and use 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.199
 gloves and still want to tell you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.990
 not scared it manicure me 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.649
 specially prepared already 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.899
 I also forgot to even greater chickenpox and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.910
 just like a washcloth 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 in order in this case 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.030
 the surface will wash out very easily 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.559
 and just because there is no there 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 sticking but when you use wash 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.440
 is there any glass if there is a bird 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.570
 ticked and if it is not blurred 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 the shadows 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 it will be very difficult to tear off 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 leach's the way it is done 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.640
 my paws are exactly this one 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.320
 the personality is our mask 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.869
 the person is this person who 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.790
 actually floods not glass 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.070
 all sorts of utility but not one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.520
 identity he's there one more he walks on 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.800
 well I can see from me I wanted 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.360
 you show it on the example of the window but so 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 like a window of 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.680
 bright light and and not see those subtleties 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 which will issue 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 through the camera, it looks clean 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.840
 he actually has a window there 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.740
 such some errors 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 Yes, I forgot about what I use 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.470
 either such here paper towels 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.200
 either newspapers at the moment me what 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.170
 there are no newspapers at home and I still use them 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.330
 such towels different rags 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.399
 waffle towel just any 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.220
 terry because it is enough here 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.720
 wool is precisely the difficulty of washing and dull 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 surface and it still leaves 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.180
 terry towels of different self 6s 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.890
 so let's get down to it 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.150
 certain procedure you will 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.150
 watch for 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.730
 and so here is my washed 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.230
 the glass table is actually glass 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.860
 surfaces pretty problematic 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.220
 amenable to washing out but still thanks 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.100
 Here is such a thing she eases your corpse 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.830
 who likes this idea and less will 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.580
 very pleased who did not like 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.620
 it 's impossible to please everyone 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.800
 use these tools which for 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.790
 you are comfortable if you use some 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.980
 another way to wash out the glass and not 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.220
 there are different glass surfaces and 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.630
 please share becoming write 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.040
 comments will not be very much 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.040
 nice to read 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.160
 before meeting my next video yet 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.160
 until 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.280
 on whom the saw rag and use and 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.520
 permanent erasing bleaching therefore 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.080
 need such an old god so 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.590
 tv hat can not be shown 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.610
 because it was daylight and gleaming 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.310
 so in the sun it was bad to be on 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.660
 actually seen as still washed 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.960

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.740
