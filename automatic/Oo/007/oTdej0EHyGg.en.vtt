the result comes back they're looking to

the result comes back they're looking to
see<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.900> you're<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.619> laboratory

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
see if you're out of the laboratory

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.380 
see if you're out of the laboratory
range<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:34.200> would<00:00:34.410> indicate<00:00:35.030> what<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> call

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
range which would indicate what we call

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.500 
range which would indicate what we call
pathologies<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.260> other<00:00:37.710> words<00:00:37.920> disease<00:00:38.510> but

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
pathologies in other words disease but

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.959 
pathologies in other words disease but
the<00:00:39.629> problem<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.559> laboratory<00:00:41.160> range<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the problem with the laboratory range is

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.020 
the problem with the laboratory range is
that<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.629> generally<00:00:43.290> set<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.129> labs<00:00:44.399> based

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that it's generally set up by labs based

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
that it's generally set up by labs based
on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> average<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> patients<00:00:46.590> coming<00:00:46.800> into

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
on the average of patients coming into

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.360 
on the average of patients coming into
the<00:00:47.219> lab<00:00:47.570> well<00:00:48.570> most<00:00:49.379> people<00:00:49.770> who<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.100> blood

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the lab well most people who get blood

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.979 
the lab well most people who get blood
tests<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:50.820> either<00:00:50.940> coming<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.420> doctors

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
tests are either coming from doctors

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.650 
tests are either coming from doctors
offices<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.500> hospitals<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> laboratory

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
offices or hospitals so the laboratory

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.369 
offices or hospitals so the laboratory
range<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.710> range<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.190> sick<00:00:56.430> people

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
range is really a range of sick people

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
range is really a range of sick people
but<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.859> way<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.430> CCN<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.030> trained<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.809> look

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
but the way the CCN is trained to look

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.680 
but the way the CCN is trained to look
at<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.500> blood<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.100> from<00:01:02.760> an<00:01:02.910> optimal<00:01:03.510> or

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
at your blood is from an optimal or

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.260 
at your blood is from an optimal or
functional<00:01:04.379> range<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.580> we're<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.880> looking

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
functional range so we're not looking

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.660 
functional range so we're not looking
for<00:01:06.299> pathologies<00:01:07.080> per<00:01:07.350> se<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> other

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
for pathologies per se but on the other

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.750 
for pathologies per se but on the other
hand<00:01:09.170> many<00:01:10.170> nutritional<00:01:10.740> deficiencies<00:01:11.400> are

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
hand many nutritional deficiencies are

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.750 
hand many nutritional deficiencies are
in<00:01:12.000> fact<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> result<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.080> disease<00:01:13.470> processes

nutritional supplementation in such

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.950 
nutritional supplementation in such
cases<00:01:22.680> does<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.610> address<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> disease<00:01:24.570> but

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
cases does not address the disease but
