some<00:01:45.600> things<00:01:46.530> caught<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.520> opinion<00:01:47.850> look<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
some things caught in my opinion look a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.640 
some things caught in my opinion look a
little<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.840> better<00:01:50.000> regarding<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.330> example

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
little bit better regarding for example

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.570

earth ground with ice around it ice was

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.510 
earth ground with ice around it ice was
I<00:01:56.910> think<00:01:57.420> something<00:01:58.320> different<00:01:58.710> would<00:01:59.190> look<00:01:59.400> a

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
towns in Markov and riften micron and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.880 
towns in Markov and riften micron and
solitude<00:04:07.010> of<00:04:07.160> belief<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:08.110> if<00:04:09.110> you<00:04:09.260> die<00:04:09.500> then

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890

he doesn't give you any money back so
that's<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.170> only<00:04:15.230> way<00:04:16.180> yes<00:04:17.180> stop<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.840> game

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
that's the only way yes stop the game

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.140 
that's the only way yes stop the game
kind<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.590> um<00:04:19.160> that's<00:04:19.970> what<00:04:20.150> he<00:04:20.239> said<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:22.150> I'm

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
kind of um that's what he said and I'm

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.040 
kind of um that's what he said and I'm
gonna<00:04:23.480> place<00:04:23.750> now<00:04:24.020> some<00:04:24.320> gold<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.860> chest

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
gonna place now some gold in the chest

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.630 
gonna place now some gold in the chest
so<00:04:27.050> that's<00:04:27.290> how<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.560> works<00:04:27.770> because<00:04:27.980> I<00:04:28.370> guess

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
so that's how it works because I guess

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.180 
so that's how it works because I guess
the<00:04:28.790> most<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.120> count<00:04:29.360> speak<00:04:30.260> German<00:04:30.680> plus

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
the most of you count speak German plus

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.720 
the most of you count speak German plus
a<00:04:31.460> couple<00:04:31.730> of<00:04:31.910> gold<00:04:32.150> there<00:04:32.360> all<00:04:33.020> right<00:04:33.290> um

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
a couple of gold there all right um

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.810 
a couple of gold there all right um
that's<00:04:34.730> a<00:04:34.910> strike<00:04:35.150> he<00:04:35.360> means<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.010> I'm<00:04:37.010> ready

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
that's a strike he means and I'm ready

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.520 
that's a strike he means and I'm ready
and<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.720> round<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.410> there's<00:04:40.130> now<00:04:40.540> that<00:04:41.540> it

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
and you round and there's now that it

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.909 
and you round and there's now that it
that's<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.100> randomization<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.990> pride

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
that's the randomization and the pride

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.110 
that's the randomization and the pride
cube<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.729> his<00:04:47.800> round<00:04:48.800> kinda<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.000> other

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
cube is his round kinda and the other

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.420 
cube is his round kinda and the other
one<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.390> yours<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.110> i<00:04:52.810> would<00:04:53.810> suggest<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.290> to

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
one is yours and i would suggest you to

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.250 
one is yours and i would suggest you to
turn<00:04:55.430> on<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.700> crosshair<00:04:56.150> for<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.540> actually

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
turn on the crosshair for this actually

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.650 
turn on the crosshair for this actually
have<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.620> off<00:04:57.740> but<00:04:58.310> otherwise<00:04:58.550> it's<00:04:58.910> hard<00:04:59.360> to

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
have it off but otherwise it's hard to

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.219 
have it off but otherwise it's hard to
hit<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.080> right<00:05:00.380> button<00:05:01.450> seed<00:05:02.450> have<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.960> dark

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
hit the right button seed have the dark

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.150 
hit the right button seed have the dark
cube<00:05:03.650> that's<00:05:04.580> mine<00:05:05.150> thing<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.290> he's<00:05:06.860> pretty

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
cube that's mine thing and he's pretty

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.000 
cube that's mine thing and he's pretty
smart<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.780> see<00:05:09.020> i<00:05:09.050> try<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.440> get<00:05:09.590> three<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:09.919> a
