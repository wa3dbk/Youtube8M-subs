00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.980
 we are back in the blackout 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.000
 We already talked about luÃ­s iauca 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.389
 he is well known in Argentina as a restorer of old cars but in this 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.759
 moment will also tell us about a slightly more modern car 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.840
 and also will try to find out what's in the engines is not that said 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.590
 effectively Kuwait 612 ha of more pure alternative energies and that develops 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.239
 a power that will amaze 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.989
 Good Lets Lose More Time It's time to open the master control door 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.859
 effort 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.140
 we are in a long launch of a mercedes-benz prototype the saints ufc 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 Nelson's father is a car that does not pollute and does not consume oil 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.600
 but of hydrogen mixed with dirty water really revolutionary author and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.810
 with all the comfort and technological advances and it seems that we are going to test 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 let's see with me 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.100
 the young engine builder 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.230
 we witnessed real 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.780
 can tell about the general operation of the driver who makes that car from the area 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.939
 How's that car? 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.720
 It's an amazing thing the car with manure 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.550
 an electric motor and to generate power 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.570
 we have a tank of fuel on a battery 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 the lithium battery can serve for the ranking of direction and low speed 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.790
 if you casey increase the power the fuel tank joins 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.930
 automatically the battery and the two work together leave the charge we have 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.910
 a consumption of 2 points nine wins of every 100 kilometers and you 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.530
 you can drive it approximately 1400 kilometers before you need it. 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.290
 refuel tank 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.370
 because the f60 did not confirm that it will not be anything 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.620
 even because we have a hydrogen function what you see coming out of the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 discharge pipe they are approached 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.130
 blond the benefit 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.210
 gave so but not 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.009
 without pollution 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.359
 the car is really amazing wanted to test the articles 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.359
 I'll be clear and let's go for a ride. Let's go for a ride. 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.790
 are exempt justifying what kind of energy we are using which the origin 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.660
 of the accident show something else 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.410
 the battery charged at the moment the brake is pressed it takes advantage of the energy 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.410
 one of the abimaq machines and equipment 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.899
 W 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:41.799
 as I have had many losses to other positions and in all the others lose 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.489
 negative ground 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.560
 remain inadequate we know the reason for the homage 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.790
 operating under our city and it really surprised 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.329
 we lost several chances but we did not 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.509
 a year before 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:01.159
 I also surprised myself with the 80 of the horses that acted at the right time 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.469
 could 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.949
 he which of them will be available from then producer dick durbin to 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.069
 to direct the ministry ensures we can adjust the level was witnessed that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.989
 we will need when they had to make a revolution in higher education in the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.379
 future 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.080
 all defendants fabricated will have to be of the same not pasted 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.270
 and will start using alternative fuel because it is the protagonist 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.300
 ends - yet you will be able to find these functions the future 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.080
 cars so efficient and you'll be able to drive making use of drugs I think 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.960
 he convinced 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.389
 I think with your Mercedes 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.269
 as 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.739
 after seeing this special report engines like this 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.390
 they got obsolete not ideal totally brand knows I'm very impressed 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.779
 with this new field in everything has comfort safety and speed and everything corrected 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:59.650
 pureit retrogene know for giving now it's a wonder that's not all seen 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.300
 because some doubts were in the air so 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.890
 because if what is at this moment is to contact directly from the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.330
 angeles california with us here in a factory to tell us a little about 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.430
 your personal experience as it is 600 friday - 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.189
 I'll compare this as I'm going to put it together. 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.919
 I'm really impressed with what I saw. 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.069
 and even more so after the pastor 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.159
 so run to us how you felt when you got in the cabin 2 600 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.110
 almost 600 thousand only learned 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.520
 your opponent 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.680
 the glazed surface 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.210
 and because it really looks like a practical car 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.650
 all previous prototypes are 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.790
 those who can not carry a large number of people or 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.229
 a lot of luggage I hear very slow one time in the media 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.919
 in this case really solve all this in a very smart way 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.300
 It seems to me that he's coming to stay for a while. Let's have him on the streets. 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.270
 how much time exactly can we have it on the market? 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.470
 I speak in ten years but I think it's going to be us and lewis how it felt like 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.020
 the first Latin American who got into the car 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.500
 it will be released in 3d but no one had rendered in June really is a 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.089
 honor an honor to have contact with him 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:11.469
 see how it works being able to talk to technicians 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.270
 understands its operation is really something that 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:17.930
 and left shivering 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.379
 but today we see how we can take care of the planet too 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.330
 I think our things 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.259
 I think people do not understand 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.349
 the severity of pollution is all a consequence of the engines 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.539
 only they burn fuels 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.629
 I think this is really the solution. 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.629
 Thank you so much for this great work for all 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.389
 I ask that we just see it seems easy seems simple but staring at the river. 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.580
 drupal predicted diego is a complex combination between chemistry 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.340
 mechanical engineering is right but it's almost a gift for science ten 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.680
 years are nothing 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.350
 science technology projects a farther future
