around the time he was believing this is
a<00:00:57.329> while<00:00:57.570> ago<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.440> internet<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:58.980> going

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
a while ago that the internet was going

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
a while ago that the internet was going
to<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> superhighway<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> book<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to be the superhighway in the book that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170 
to be the superhighway in the book that
he<00:01:00.690> wrote<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.609> notion<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
he wrote about that and the notion that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200 
he wrote about that and the notion that
all<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.379> these<00:01:04.559> things<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> happen<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
all of these things that happen kind of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
all of these things that happen kind of
in<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> world<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.380> preemptory<00:01:08.220> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
in the world that are preemptory but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
in the world that are preemptory but
that<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> time<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.049> hear<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.290> him<00:01:10.650> like

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that at the time you hear about him like

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
that at the time you hear about him like
when<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> heard<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> World<00:01:11.760> Wide<00:01:11.939> Web

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
when you heard about the World Wide Web

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.740 
when you heard about the World Wide Web
I'm<00:01:12.479> mber<00:01:13.439> thinking<00:01:13.909> what<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> heck<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I'm mber thinking what the heck is that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.070 
I'm mber thinking what the heck is that
and<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:17.790> has<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.299> story<00:01:18.750> after<00:01:19.049> another

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and so he has one story after another

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.920 
and so he has one story after another
about<00:01:19.860> these<00:01:20.700> magical<00:01:21.270> things<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.659> happen

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
about these magical things that happen

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200 
about these magical things that happen
in<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> world<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> complexity<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
in the world and the complexity and the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
in the world and the complexity and the
magic<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.259> think<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.650> he's<00:01:26.310> telling

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
magic and I think it just he's telling

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.670 
magic and I think it just he's telling
stories<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.240> read<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:28.020> than<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.200> book<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.590> a

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
especially for the last two years I've

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.510 
especially for the last two years I've
been<00:03:51.750> drawing<00:03:52.050> circles<00:03:52.590> I'm<00:03:53.100> not<00:03:53.310> drawing

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
been drawing circles I'm not drawing

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.610 
been drawing circles I'm not drawing
right<00:03:53.820> now<00:03:53.970> because<00:03:54.240> I'm<00:03:54.630> finished<00:03:55.050> major

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
right now because I'm finished major

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.550 
right now because I'm finished major
projects<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.420> sit<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:57.840> my<00:03:57.990> drawing<00:03:58.230> book

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
projects but to sit in my drawing book

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.730 
projects but to sit in my drawing book
and<00:03:58.830> imagine<00:03:59.790> action<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.740> two-dimensional

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
and imagine action in two-dimensional

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.550 
and imagine action in two-dimensional
space<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.550> ask<00:04:02.970> questions<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.810> side<00:04:04.020> it's

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
space and ask questions on the side it's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.590 
space and ask questions on the side it's
it<00:04:05.520> doesn't<00:04:05.790> get<00:04:05.880> better<00:04:06.000> than<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.390> just

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
it doesn't get better than that I just

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.570 
it doesn't get better than that I just
think<00:04:07.500> drawing<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.130> believing<00:04:09.980> I'm<00:04:10.980> Elizabeth

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
think drawing is believing I'm Elizabeth

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.510 
think drawing is believing I'm Elizabeth
