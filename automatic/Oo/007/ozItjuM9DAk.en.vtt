now<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.830> spend<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.130> lot<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.400> time<00:00:08.580> thinking

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
now we spend a lot of time thinking

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.690 
now we spend a lot of time thinking
about<00:00:09.120> how<00:00:09.269> climate<00:00:09.870> will<00:00:09.990> affect<00:00:10.290> crops<00:00:10.740> but

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
about how climate will affect crops but

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.640 
about how climate will affect crops but
crops<00:00:12.000> affect<00:00:12.330> climate<00:00:12.570> themselves<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.590> they

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
crops affect climate themselves and they

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.749 
crops affect climate themselves and they
do<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:13.920> two<00:00:14.160> ways

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
do this in two ways

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.930 
do this in two ways
first<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.900> all<00:00:16.049> about<00:00:16.680> 1/4<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.699> land

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
first of all about 1/4 of the land

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.560 
first of all about 1/4 of the land
surface<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.810> used<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.710> growing<00:00:19.859> crops

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
surface is used for growing crops

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.710 
surface is used for growing crops
another<00:00:21.570> 1015<00:00:22.320> %<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.949> used<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.279> pasture<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
another 1015 % are used for pasture so a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
another 1015 % are used for pasture so a
substantial<00:00:25.380> amount<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> land<00:00:26.250> surface

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
substantial amount of the land surface

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.750 
substantial amount of the land surface
is<00:00:27.180> used<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.230> crop<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.010> agricultural

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
is used in crop and agricultural

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240 
is used in crop and agricultural
production<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.500> how<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> land

production and how we use that land

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.180 
production and how we use that land
affects<00:00:32.700> our<00:00:32.880> climate<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.800> were<00:00:34.950> for

example to DeForest a substantial area
and<00:00:38.550> replace<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.450> her<00:00:39.690> annual<00:00:40.050> crops

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and replace it with her annual crops

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.310 
and replace it with her annual crops
such<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.710> soya<00:00:41.070> bean<00:00:41.360> then<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.989> alter

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
such as soya bean then we would alter

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.520 
such as soya bean then we would alter
the<00:00:43.500> characteristics<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> land<00:00:45.090> surface

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the characteristics of the land surface

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.290 
the characteristics of the land surface
alter<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> way<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.070> water<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> heat<00:00:47.879> flows

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
alter the way that water and heat flows

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
alter the way that water and heat flows
from<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.840> land<00:00:49.050> surface<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> atmosphere

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
from the land surface to the atmosphere

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.479 
from the land surface to the atmosphere
and<00:00:50.550> back<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.270> ultimately<00:00:52.140> change<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and back and ultimately change the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
and back and ultimately change the
regional<00:00:53.969> climate<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.809> there's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.649> large

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
regional climate if there's a large

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
enough change the land surface so this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
enough change the land surface so this
is<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.410> absolutely<00:00:58.469> fascinating<00:00:59.160> topic<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is an absolutely fascinating topic and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.950 
is an absolutely fascinating topic and
one<00:00:59.789> that's<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.210> quite<00:01:00.300> difficult<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
one that's really quite difficult to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.740 
one that's really quite difficult to
understand<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> complexity

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
understand because of the complexity

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.240 
understand because of the complexity
it's<00:01:03.750> difficult<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.500> needs<00:01:04.710> us<00:01:05.040> as

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's difficult because it needs us as

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.830 
it's difficult because it needs us as
crop<00:01:05.460> scientists<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> work<00:01:06.150> even<00:01:06.570> more

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
crop scientists to work even more

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
crop scientists to work even more
closely<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.560> our<00:01:07.590> climate<00:01:08.340> scientist

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
closely with our climate scientist

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
closely with our climate scientist
colleagues<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.220> difficult<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:11.670> we

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
colleagues and it's difficult because we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
colleagues and it's difficult because we
have<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.000> join<00:01:12.210> our<00:01:12.510> models<00:01:13.140> together<00:01:13.850> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
have to join our models together and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
have to join our models together and
what<00:01:15.000> we've<00:01:15.119> done<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.570> reading<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> one

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
what we've done that at reading is one

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
what we've done that at reading is one
of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> only<00:01:16.740> groups<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> world<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.090> do

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of the only groups in the world to do

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
of the only groups in the world to do
this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.439> taken<00:01:19.830> our<00:01:19.950> crop<00:01:20.159> model<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
this is we have taken our crop model and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.539 
this is we have taken our crop model and
we've<00:01:20.939> put<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> inside<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.650> climate<00:01:23.100> model<00:01:23.400> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we've put it inside the climate model of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.060 
we've put it inside the climate model of
the<00:01:23.880> UK<00:01:24.180> Hadley<00:01:24.509> Centre<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.040> our

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the UK Hadley Centre so now we have our

many<00:01:35.729> researchers<00:01:36.299> worldwide<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> very

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
many researchers worldwide this is very

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
many researchers worldwide this is very
exciting<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.270> crops<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.780> grow<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
exciting because the crops can grow and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.370 
exciting because the crops can grow and
respond<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> climate<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.720> also<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.079> climate

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
respond to climate and also the climate

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.520 
respond to climate and also the climate
over<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:45.090> respond<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> changes<00:01:46.229> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
over time can respond to changes that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.969 
over time can respond to changes that
are<00:01:46.649> made<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.579> crop<00:01:48.000> surface<00:01:48.979> now

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
are made at the crop surface now

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
are made at the crop surface now
agriculture<00:01:50.520> also<00:01:50.700> contributes<00:01:51.689> largely<00:01:52.079> to

that are used to grow those crops and I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.590 
that are used to grow those crops and I
think<00:03:59.490> recently<00:03:59.910> we've<00:04:00.120> seen<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.330> lot<00:04:00.570> of

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
think recently we've seen a lot of

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.450 
think recently we've seen a lot of
environmental<00:04:01.140> concern<00:04:01.710> over<00:04:01.890> biofuels

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
environmental concern over biofuels

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.730 
environmental concern over biofuels
being<00:04:02.760> voiced<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.600> we<00:04:03.750> don't<00:04:03.990> at<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.320> moment

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
being voiced and we don't at the moment

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.280 
being voiced and we don't at the moment
have<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.250> science<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.820> inform<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.570> sort<00:04:07.230> of

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
have the science to inform that sort of

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.220 
have the science to inform that sort of
policy<00:04:07.740> debate<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:09.570> projects<00:04:09.990> that<00:04:10.140> are

policy debate and so projects that are

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.480 
policy debate and so projects that are
just<00:04:10.380> starting<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.280> Walker
