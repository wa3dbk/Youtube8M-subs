00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.930 
action cam so I suggest you take a
picture<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.049> because<00:02:28.410> every<00:02:29.310> Sony<00:02:29.670> action

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
picture of it because every Sony action

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.280 
picture of it because every Sony action
cam<00:02:30.180> has<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> unique<00:02:31.410> password<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:33.299> it's<00:02:34.049> not<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
cam has a unique password so it's not a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.539 
cam has a unique password so it's not a
one-size-fits-all

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
one-size-fits-all

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.449 
one-size-fits-all
so<00:02:35.970> memorize<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.069> need<00:02:38.280> to

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
