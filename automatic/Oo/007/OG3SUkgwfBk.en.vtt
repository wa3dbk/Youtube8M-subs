to use a German martingale but the draw

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
range the the main difference between

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.089 
range the the main difference between
the<00:00:28.789> drawings<00:00:29.269> in<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.080> German<00:00:30.410> martingale<00:00:30.859> is

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
the drawings in the German martingale is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.920 
the drawings in the German martingale is
you<00:00:31.640> can<00:00:31.820> position<00:00:33.250> either<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.910> position<00:00:35.809> of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
you can position either the position of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.750 
you can position either the position of
the<00:00:36.020> draw<00:00:36.200> reins<00:00:36.469> either<00:00:36.739> higher<00:00:37.160> or<00:00:37.460> lower

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
the draw reins either higher or lower

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.970 
the draw reins either higher or lower
and<00:00:38.120> that's<00:00:38.690> not<00:00:38.840> possible<00:00:39.110> with<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.680> German

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
and that's not possible with the German

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.119 
and that's not possible with the German
martingale<00:00:41.530> I'm<00:00:42.530> going<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.770> show<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:42.949> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
martingale I'm going to show you the

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.920 
martingale I'm going to show you the
different<00:00:43.430> positions<00:00:43.579> on<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:44.180> horse<00:00:44.390> now

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
different positions on this horse now

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.360 
different positions on this horse now
this<00:00:45.110> is<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.289> young<00:00:45.559> horse<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.039> he's<00:00:46.160> kind<00:00:46.309> of

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
this is a young horse and he's kind of

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.400 
this is a young horse and he's kind of
squirming<00:00:46.940> around<00:00:47.059> here<00:00:47.510> probably<00:00:48.020> not<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
squirming around here probably not the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.920 
squirming around here probably not the
probably<00:00:49.100> not<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.340> ideal<00:00:49.370> horse<00:00:50.359> to<00:00:50.570> use<00:00:50.719> for

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
probably not the ideal horse to use for

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.810 
probably not the ideal horse to use for
this<00:00:51.050> demonstration<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:52.520> got<00:00:52.670> him

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
this demonstration but we got him

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.700 
this demonstration but we got him
saddled<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:54.079> know<00:00:54.170> we're<00:00:54.410> going<00:00:54.530> to<00:00:54.590> use

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
saddled so you know we're going to use

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.869 
saddled so you know we're going to use
him<00:00:54.859> but<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.890> would<00:00:57.890> use<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.219> draw<00:00:58.399> reins<00:00:58.670> on<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
him but I would use the draw reins on a

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.299 
him but I would use the draw reins on a
horse<00:00:59.149> that<00:01:00.109> I<00:01:00.199> needed<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.590> get<00:01:00.710> supple<00:01:01.010> dup

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
horse that I needed to get supple dup

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.040 
horse that I needed to get supple dup
that<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.699> needed<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.149> teach<00:01:02.390> him<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.629> give<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.929> my

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
that I needed to teach him to give to my

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.439 
that I needed to teach him to give to my
hands<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.980> I<00:01:04.010> needed<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.640> work<00:01:04.820> on<00:01:05.269> their

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
hands that I needed to work on their

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.140 
hands that I needed to work on their
head<00:01:05.630> position<00:01:06.200> either<00:01:06.770> raise<00:01:07.220> their<00:01:07.610> Pole<00:01:07.850> or

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
head position either raise their Pole or

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.359 
head position either raise their Pole or
lower<00:01:08.360> their<00:01:08.630> poll<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.799> draw<00:01:09.979> reins<00:01:10.220> are

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
lower their poll the draw reins are

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.640 
lower their poll the draw reins are
really<00:01:10.580> good<00:01:10.759> for<00:01:10.939> that<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.409> also<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.439> horse

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
really good for that and also a horse

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.340 
really good for that and also a horse
that<00:01:12.830> that's<00:01:13.189> stiff<00:01:13.880> laterally<00:01:14.810> they're

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
that that's stiff laterally they're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.929 
that that's stiff laterally they're
really<00:01:15.619> good<00:01:15.830> at<00:01:16.009> getting<00:01:16.100> lateral<00:01:16.549> flexion

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
really good at getting lateral flexion

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.109 
really good at getting lateral flexion
also<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:17.689> pretty<00:01:17.810> good<00:01:18.020> tool<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.670> I've<00:01:19.880> got<00:01:20.119> a

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
also it's pretty good tool so I've got a

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.399 
also it's pretty good tool so I've got a
snaffle<00:01:23.119> bit<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:23.570> horse's<00:01:23.810> mouth<00:01:24.110> and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
snaffle bit in this horse's mouth and

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.190 
snaffle bit in this horse's mouth and
that's<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.729> little<00:01:26.030> too<00:01:26.390> much<00:01:26.570> snaffle<00:01:27.079> for

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
that's a little too much snaffle for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020 
that's a little too much snaffle for
this<00:01:27.320> or<00:01:27.500> assess<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.860> thin<00:01:28.070> twisted<00:01:28.460> wire<00:01:28.670> and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
this or assess the thin twisted wire and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.810 
this or assess the thin twisted wire and
he's<00:01:29.150> not<00:01:29.360> ready<00:01:29.810> for<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.079> but<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.670> we're

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
he's not ready for that but but we're

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.090 
he's not ready for that but but we're
just<00:01:32.030> demonstrating<00:01:32.149> here<00:01:32.810> we've<00:01:33.409> got<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.799> bit

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
just demonstrating here we've got a bit

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.819 
just demonstrating here we've got a bit
hobble<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.750> snaffle<00:01:36.200> bit<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:36.619> is<00:01:36.799> a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
hobble on the snaffle bit and this is a

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.219 
hobble on the snaffle bit and this is a
loose<00:01:37.070> ring<00:01:37.340> snaffle<00:01:37.700> bit<00:01:38.229> browband

snaffle<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.560> end<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.100> snap<00:02:02.320> snapped<00:02:03.320> into

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
snaffle the end of the snap snapped into

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.480 
snaffle the end of the snap snapped into
the<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.520> girth<00:02:05.149> ring<00:02:05.689> right<00:02:05.899> here<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.490> that

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
the the girth ring right here and that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.290 
the the girth ring right here and that
position<00:02:08.500> allows<00:02:09.500> us<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.880> get<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> nice<00:02:13.090> drop<00:02:14.090> of

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
position allows us to get a nice drop of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.400 
position allows us to get a nice drop of
the<00:02:14.360> nose

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the nose

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.410 
the nose
and<00:02:15.500> teach<00:02:16.340> him<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.640> give<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.240> and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and teach him to give to the bit and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.570 
and teach him to give to the bit and
give<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.780> our<00:02:17.900> hands<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.980> can<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.250> you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
give to our hands and you can see you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.720 
give to our hands and you can see you
can<00:02:19.700> see<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> level<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.890> like

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
can see the level of that now I like

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.220 
can see the level of that now I like
this<00:02:22.970> horse's<00:02:23.360> head<00:02:23.480> position<00:02:23.990> right<00:02:24.200> there

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
this horse's head position right there

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.660 
this horse's head position right there
looks<00:02:24.800> pretty<00:02:24.890> good<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.340> me

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
looks pretty good to me

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.850 
looks pretty good to me
but<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.270> we<00:02:26.360> had<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.600> real<00:02:26.900> horse<00:02:27.410> with<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.680> real

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
but if we had a real horse with a real

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.430 
but if we had a real horse with a real
high<00:02:28.160> pole<00:02:28.820> carriage<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.810> want<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.110> carry<00:02:30.290> his

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
high pole carriage you want to carry his

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.830 
high pole carriage you want to carry his
head<00:02:30.650> real<00:02:30.890> high<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.430> would<00:02:32.120> change<00:02:32.480> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
head real high I would change the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.960 
head real high I would change the
position<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.670> draw<00:02:34.670> reins

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.930 

unsnap<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.150> from<00:02:38.600> there<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:40.550> take<00:02:40.790> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
unsnap it from there and I would take it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.380 
unsnap it from there and I would take it
down<00:02:40.970> between<00:02:41.540> his<00:02:41.900> front<00:02:42.470> legs<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.190> snap<00:02:44.150> it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
down between his front legs and snap it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.570 
down between his front legs and snap it
into<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.470> girth<00:02:46.220> ring<00:02:47.890> between<00:02:48.890> his<00:02:49.040> legs<00:02:49.250> and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
into the girth ring between his legs and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.280 
into the girth ring between his legs and
that<00:02:50.240> would<00:02:50.390> give<00:02:50.570> me<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.960> lower<00:02:51.380> pull<00:02:51.890> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that would give me a lower pull and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.010 
that would give me a lower pull and
would<00:02:54.290> lower<00:02:54.850> his<00:02:55.850> Pole<00:02:56.150> okay

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
would lower his Pole okay

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.890 
would lower his Pole okay
so<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.530> works<00:02:57.680> really<00:02:57.890> good<00:02:58.010> for<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.900> I'm

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
so it works really good for that I'm

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.560 
so it works really good for that I'm
getting<00:03:00.230> parallel<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.860> camera<00:03:01.360> come<00:03:02.360> on

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.890 

now<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.900> horse<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:07.300> if<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.510> have<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.660> horse

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
now a horse that if you have a horse

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.500 
now a horse that if you have a horse
that<00:03:08.960> carries<00:03:09.410> his<00:03:09.590> head<00:03:09.800> too<00:03:10.160> low<00:03:10.510> which

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
that carries his head too low which

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.870 
that carries his head too low which
there<00:03:12.440> are<00:03:12.560> some<00:03:12.800> horses<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.220> do<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.670> I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
there are some horses that do that I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.850 
there are some horses that do that I
would<00:03:14.600> change<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.200> position<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.940> here

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
would change the position to up here

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880 
would change the position to up here
this<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.220> breast<00:03:19.850> collar<00:03:20.090> DS<00:03:20.960> or<00:03:21.680> you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
this is the breast collar DS or you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.790 
this is the breast collar DS or you
could<00:03:22.070> even<00:03:22.220> go<00:03:22.580> up<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> saddle<00:03:24.260> horn<00:03:24.440> but

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
could even go up to the saddle horn but

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.260 
could even go up to the saddle horn but
right<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.250> breast<00:03:25.460> collar<00:03:25.670> DS<00:03:25.940> works

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
right to the breast collar DS works

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.910 
right to the breast collar DS works
great<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.160> that'll<00:03:28.160> give<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.910> little<00:03:29.360> bit

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
great and that'll give you a little bit

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.730 
great and that'll give you a little bit
higher<00:03:31.330> pull<00:03:32.330> where<00:03:32.900> it's<00:03:33.170> going<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.380> keep<00:03:33.530> his

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
higher pull where it's going to keep his

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.940 
higher pull where it's going to keep his
pole<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.430> little<00:03:35.150> elevated<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.320> nose<00:03:36.560> is

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
pole a little elevated but the nose is

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.130 
pole a little elevated but the nose is
going<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.400> get<00:03:37.730> come<00:03:38.000> in<00:03:38.210> give<00:03:38.630> your<00:03:38.900> hands

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
going to get come in give your hands

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.660 
going to get come in give your hands
going<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.500> really<00:03:39.680> teach<00:03:39.920> him<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.190> flex<00:03:40.430> at<00:03:40.580> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
going to really teach him to flex at the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.710 
going to really teach him to flex at the
pole<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.660> works<00:03:41.930> really<00:03:42.050> good<00:03:43.060> now<00:03:44.060> it's

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
pole so that works really good now it's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.920 
pole so that works really good now it's
important<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.760> set<00:03:47.209> these<00:03:47.390> draw<00:03:47.660> reins

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
important that you set these draw reins

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.730 
important that you set these draw reins
up<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:49.370> run<00:03:49.910> put<00:03:50.240> them<00:03:50.420> through<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.740> snaffle

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
up and run put them through the snaffle

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.820 
up and run put them through the snaffle
rings<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.190> right<00:03:52.370> way<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.750> way<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:54.050> goes<00:03:54.350> is

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
rings the right way the way it goes is

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.090 
rings the right way the way it goes is
from<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.220> inside<00:03:55.760> out<00:03:56.380> let<00:03:57.380> me<00:03:57.500> change<00:03:57.740> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
from the inside out let me change the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.840 
from the inside out let me change the
snap<00:03:58.640> here<00:03:58.970> back<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.890> position<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.550> and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
snap here back to this position here and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.420 
snap here back to this position here and
the<00:04:01.940> girth<00:04:02.120> ring<00:04:02.620> really<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.040> standard

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
the girth ring really is the standard

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.920 
the girth ring really is the standard
position<00:04:04.610> that's<00:04:05.060> where<00:04:05.240> most<00:04:05.330> people<00:04:05.720> use

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
position that's where most people use

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.930 
position that's where most people use
them<00:04:06.110> but<00:04:06.950> when<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.160> when<00:04:07.640> you're<00:04:07.760> going<00:04:07.880> to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
them but when you when you're going to

them but when you when you're going to
put<00:04:08.150> them<00:04:08.330> when<00:04:08.720> you're<00:04:08.840> going<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.020> put<00:04:09.080> them

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
put them when you're going to put them

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.490 
put them when you're going to put them
on<00:04:09.620> your<00:04:09.709> horse<00:04:10.540> what<00:04:11.540> you're<00:04:11.720> going<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.900> do<00:04:12.140> is

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.789 
is if you're holding the rain you get
the<00:04:19.220> snap<00:04:19.489> you're<00:04:20.270> going<00:04:20.420> to<00:04:20.480> go<00:04:20.660> in<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.410> this

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
the snap you're going to go in this this

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.469 
the snap you're going to go in this this
case<00:04:22.070> from<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.460> outside<00:04:22.910> in

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
case from the outside in

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.969 
case from the outside in
so<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.050> snap<00:04:24.290> goes<00:04:24.590> through<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.220> ring<00:04:26.979> snap

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
so the snap goes through the ring snap

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.230 
so the snap goes through the ring snap
it<00:04:28.190> into<00:04:28.340> place

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
it into place

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.420 
it into place
and<00:04:29.389> I've<00:04:30.020> got<00:04:31.180> I've<00:04:32.180> got<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.889> little<00:04:33.889> knob<00:04:34.160> on

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
and I've got I've got the little knob on

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.600 
and I've got I've got the little knob on
the<00:04:34.580> snap<00:04:34.850> pointing<00:04:35.419> out<00:04:35.539> so<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.229> not

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
the snap pointing out so it's not

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.800 
the snap pointing out so it's not
digging<00:04:37.610> into<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.880> horse<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.270> irritating

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
digging into the horse and irritating

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.409 
digging into the horse and irritating
him<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.620> now<00:04:39.770> when<00:04:39.949> I<00:04:39.979> used<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.910> rein<00:04:41.120> rigged

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
him but now when I used the rein rigged

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.230 
him but now when I used the rein rigged
up<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:41.810> way<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:43.250> rains<00:04:43.460> come<00:04:43.880> in<00:04:44.000> from<00:04:44.150> the

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
up that way the rains come in from the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.180 
up that way the rains come in from the
inside<00:04:44.690> out<00:04:44.960> so<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.740> when<00:04:45.889> I'm<00:04:45.979> going<00:04:46.070> to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
inside out so that when I'm going to

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.670 
inside out so that when I'm going to
bend<00:04:46.370> him<00:04:46.580> laterally<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:49.280> slides<00:04:49.820> smoothly

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
bend him laterally it slides smoothly

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.950 
bend him laterally it slides smoothly
through<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.860> ring<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.460> doesn't<00:04:53.240> bind<00:04:53.449> up<00:04:53.750> if

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
through that ring it doesn't bind up if

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.650 
through that ring it doesn't bind up if
you<00:04:54.050> have<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.560> opposite<00:04:55.009> way<00:04:55.120> then<00:04:56.120> it's

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
you have it the opposite way then it's

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.240 
you have it the opposite way then it's
going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.840> drag<00:04:57.229> through<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:57.770> ring<00:04:58.009> and

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
going to drag through that ring and

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.860 
going to drag through that ring and
hang-ups<00:04:58.699> not<00:04:58.910> going<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.120> work<00:04:59.270> as<00:04:59.449> good<00:04:59.660> okay

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
hang-ups not going to work as good okay

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.620 
hang-ups not going to work as good okay
now<00:05:02.259> now<00:05:03.259> we<00:05:03.289> have<00:05:03.470> these<00:05:03.919> drawings<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:05.270> my

the reins off you just unsnap the pulley
the<00:05:26.560> some<00:05:27.560> people<00:05:27.830> love<00:05:28.039> using<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.639> little

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
the some people love using the little

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
pulley that they come with I prefer to

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.360 
pulley that they come with I prefer to
do<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.419> this<00:05:32.570> way<00:05:32.780> myself<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:34.010> it's<00:05:34.220> just

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
do it this way myself but it's just

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.820 
do it this way myself but it's just
personal<00:05:34.880> preference<00:05:35.919> so<00:05:36.919> anyway<00:05:38.830> that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
personal preference so anyway that

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.390 
personal preference so anyway that
pretty<00:05:40.159> much<00:05:41.560> explains<00:05:42.560> how<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.860> use<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.220> draw

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
pretty much explains how to use the draw

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.870 
pretty much explains how to use the draw
reins<00:05:43.669> now<00:05:44.300> some<00:05:45.050> people<00:05:45.229> will<00:05:45.860> use<00:05:46.250> just<00:05:46.820> a

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
reins now some people will use just a

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.120 
reins now some people will use just a
regular<00:05:47.000> Snapple<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:47.900> leave<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.800> regular

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
regular Snapple and leave the regular

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.659 
regular Snapple and leave the regular
rains<00:05:49.430> on<00:05:49.849> the<00:05:50.050> Snapple<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.199> then<00:05:52.010> just<00:05:52.310> run

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
rains on the Snapple and then just run

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.730 
rains on the Snapple and then just run
the<00:05:52.820> draw<00:05:53.030> reins<00:05:53.330> through<00:05:53.900> through<00:05:54.289> that<00:05:54.470> ring

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
the draw reins through through that ring

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.909 
the draw reins through through that ring
above<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.760> regular<00:05:56.090> reins<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.659> that<00:05:57.260> way<00:05:57.409> you

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
above the regular reins and that way you

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.779 
above the regular reins and that way you
can<00:05:58.099> use<00:05:58.310> your<00:05:58.340> your<00:05:58.820> regular<00:05:59.180> straight<00:05:59.479> reins

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
can use your your regular straight reins

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.460 
can use your your regular straight reins
when<00:06:01.789> you're<00:06:02.270> just<00:06:02.509> normally<00:06:03.020> riding<00:06:03.380> the

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
when you're just normally riding the

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.180 
when you're just normally riding the
horse<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:03.979> if<00:06:04.430> he<00:06:04.520> starts<00:06:04.759> getting<00:06:05.770> heavy<00:06:06.770> or

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
horse and if he starts getting heavy or

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.360 
horse and if he starts getting heavy or
getting<00:06:07.940> stiff<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:09.050> can<00:06:09.199> pick<00:06:09.740> up<00:06:09.770> your<00:06:10.099> draw

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
getting stiff you can pick up your draw

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.080 
getting stiff you can pick up your draw
reins<00:06:10.669> and<00:06:11.020> use<00:06:12.020> them<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:13.490> you're<00:06:13.729> basically

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
reins and use them and you're basically

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.649 
reins and use them and you're basically
riding<00:06:14.419> with<00:06:14.750> with<00:06:15.169> two<00:06:15.650> sets<00:06:15.919> of<00:06:16.130> reins

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
riding with with two sets of reins

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.909 
riding with with two sets of reins
that'll<00:06:17.659> work<00:06:17.780> good<00:06:17.990> but<00:06:18.470> it's<00:06:18.620> kind<00:06:18.800> of<00:06:18.860> a

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
that'll work good but it's kind of a

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.260 
that'll work good but it's kind of a
handful<00:06:19.370> takes<00:06:19.639> a<00:06:19.729> little<00:06:19.820> while<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.030> get<00:06:20.210> used

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
handful takes a little while to get used

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.510 
handful takes a little while to get used
to<00:06:20.539> that<00:06:20.750> but<00:06:21.650> so<00:06:21.979> anyway<00:06:22.220> that<00:06:22.759> pretty<00:06:23.000> much

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
to that but so anyway that pretty much

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.189 
to that but so anyway that pretty much
wraps<00:06:25.520> up<00:06:25.849> the<00:06:26.180> explanation<00:06:26.750> of<00:06:26.840> how<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:26.990> use

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
wraps up the explanation of how to use

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:37.330 
wraps up the explanation of how to use
